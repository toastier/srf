<note>2/6/09:  DP comments from TC:  good potential/ drive to become a solid, productive educator/researcher; would require mentoring. I would not recommend Ms. Carthron for an interview or follow up. I think she has good potential and drive to become a solid and productive educator and researcher. However, I do not think we have the human resources  to provide for her the mentoring she has missed and that which she will continue to need. It would be a disservice to provide less. It is most unfortunate, that her doctoral studies will not culminate in producing the outcome attributes that will enable her to go smoothly  to the next step in her career without a level of coaching few will be willing to give.  CB to discuss w/AMcB.</note>

Unless I hear otherwise, I will work on getting the references.  I will be out of town beginning tomorrow and will be back on Wed (day before Thanksgiving) do I probably won&apos;t make much progress until after Thanksgiving.  Ruth</note>

<note>Based on  TV email of 11/28 that follows, committee agreed that candidate will receive a regret ltr; ltr sent 12/7.  On Song  …  While her 2 references were extremely positive about her abilities as a researcher, none could comment on her teaching and none could offer any examples or supportive comments regarding her “demonstrated leadership of EBP and implementation science initiatives” as called for in our position description.  Additionally, when I spoke with this candidate about EBP, all she could talk about was using evidence to underlie her own clinical practice as an RN.  When I asked about implementation science, she really did not seem to know what I was talking about and kept talking about doing research.  Additionally, she asked many questions about the DNP program, almost as if she knew nothing about that kind of program.  To be honest, she sounded delightful, she seems to be quite exceptional as a researcher, and her references were extremely supportive  …  but I did not get the sense that she has the experience, understanding or leadership in EBP/implementation science to meet the qualifications we posted.  My initial recommendation is to NOT proceed to a visit, but I would welcome the opportunity for our committee to discuss this.</note>

I do think being on campus/Durham area 5+ days per week will be too much, especially since I want to begin a postdoc at Chapel Hill in the fall. Please remove my application from consideration.

Thanks,

Kristen, Our search committee met today and I wanted to follow-up with you regarding the ABSN Adult Health Position. I wanted to say that the program is an on-campus 5+ day per week program and faculty are expected to be available during that time frame. When I say +, I mean that students are in clinical on the weekends and there are several weekend events for ABSN students that faculty participate in. Let me know your thoughts. Chip

I think we need to send a regret letter with an option to reapply when she has a definite date for completing the DNP.  No point going through this again!  Crystal, please follow up.

Hi Team,

     I just completed a phone screen for the FNP candidate Susan Marshall.   

Recommendation:  I am vacillating on my recommendation for this candidate.  She is a very experienced FNP and clinician and has 3-4 semesters of good clinical and classroom (MSN) teaching at UNC-CH.  She has taken a couple of courses in Nursing Education as a DNP student at Vanderbilt.   She has no scholarship.  She seemed fairly certain that she would be finished her DNP by August 2012 but &quot;not totally certain&quot;.   She seemed more passionate about pediatric end of the FNP continuum.
She was well spoken and passionate about FNP education, but her CV and her productivity are just mediocre.

I don’t feel confident she could sustain 50% funding on her own. She has very little to no experience submitting her own grants. I am not certain how likely her funding from her current home would continue if she moved to DUSON. At this time I recommend no further efforts to recruit. PT

Dear Paula and Brigit:
                Please see Beth’s response below. My interpretation of this email, and Beth please correct me if I am wrong, is as follows. Laura could contribute to areas we have teaching needs, even though we have current faculty who can teach them; perhaps the most central issue is whether she can maintain external level of funding through obtainment of grants, etc. My own concern is not so much if she can teach, but more whether she can consistently obtain 50% research funding – which is perhaps a question to ask the candidate—and importantly contribute to areas of research that we have a need (e.g., cancer prevention research, patient provider communication). Let me know what you think based on Beth’s comment so we can make a final recommendation to the committee. I think we are close to closure on this position.
 
Take care,
Isaac

Isaac,
We have sufficient faculty to teach health promotion until any one individual who is teaching it becomes funded or is not available to teach.  We continue to be hiring numerous contract faculty to teach in the area of research/scholarship in the master’s courses.  This is the likely primary teaching assignment but would also see her as a back-up for health promotion.  We can only fill the position if she has 50% external funding so that should be documented.  The question for me is whether or not she would make a significant contribution to our research mission----does she have the potential for significant success in research, including ongoing external funding and can she support the teaching needs of the school.
Beth

Dear Beth:
            Both Paula and Brigit are leaning to cease recruitment for the Track III position for Laura Fish. Before I suggest this to the committee, can you address please the question that Paula put forth as to what the need is right now for someone to teach health promotion and research/scholarship.  Do we have sufficient faculty right now that can accommodate these courses? 
 
Thanks,
Isaac

I agree with Bridit. Dr. Fish has no teaching experience and it is unclear when her funding will expire. Unless we have serious unmet teaching needs in the areas mentioned by Beth, I vote stop recruitment at this time. If we do have needs, then I would recommend phone interview to clarify funding.

Dear Paula and Brigit:
            Hope both of you are well. Per our last search committee meeting, a couple of questions were raised concerning Laura Fish with respect to the Track III position. One of them was what the teaching expectation and courses would be. I asked Dr. Merwin to clarify this issue further. Her emailed response is below.  
 
Based on this updated information, please let me know whether you believe a phone screen is warranted. The two most salient issues that emerged were how would be able to sustain 50% funding given her current and submitted grants and her experiences teaching. In your consideration to this question, please keep in mind what skills and background she would bring that would benefit DUSON. If you could let me know if the next day or two, that would be great. Thank you again for your efforts and input.
 
Take care,
Isaac
 
 
 
Isaac,
My apologies for the delay. I wanted to get some feedback from a program director on appropriate courses for a non-nurse with a PH background. 
I would expect that she would teach in the research/scholarship and the health promotion content areas.  
The expectation would be that she would be 50% externally funded and that she would teach an additional 3 courses.
Take care,
Beth
 
 I feel the same and also feel she will need significant teaching mentorship.

I don’t feel confident she could sustain 50% funding on her own. She has very little to no experience submitting her own grants. I am not certain how likely her funding from her current home would continue if she moved to DUSON. At this time I recommend no further efforts to recruit. PT

Dear Paula and Brigit:
                Please see Beth’s response below. My interpretation of this email, and Beth please correct me if I am wrong, is as follows. Laura could contribute to areas we have teaching needs, even though we have current faculty who can teach them; perhaps the most central issue is whether she can maintain external level of funding through obtainment of grants, etc. My own concern is not so much if she can teach, but more whether she can consistently obtain 50% research funding – which is perhaps a question to ask the candidate—and importantly contribute to areas of research that we have a need (e.g., cancer prevention research, patient provider communication). Let me know what you think based on Beth’s comment so we can make a final recommendation to the committee. I think we are close to closure on this position.
 
Take care,
Isaac

Isaac,
We have sufficient faculty to teach health promotion until any one individual who is teaching it becomes funded or is not available to teach.  We continue to be hiring numerous contract faculty to teach in the area of research/scholarship in the master’s courses.  This is the likely primary teaching assignment but would also see her as a back-up for health promotion.  We can only fill the position if she has 50% external funding so that should be documented.  The question for me is whether or not she would make a significant contribution to our research mission----does she have the potential for significant success in research, including ongoing external funding and can she support the teaching needs of the school.

Dear Beth:
            Both Paula and Brigit are leaning to cease recruitment for the Track III position for Laura Fish. Before I suggest this to the committee, can you address please the question that Paula put forth as to what the need is right now for someone to teach health promotion and research/scholarship.  Do we have sufficient faculty right now that can accommodate these courses? 
 
Thanks,
Isaac

I agree with Bridit. Dr. Fish has no teaching experience and it is unclear when her funding will expire. Unless we have serious unmet teaching needs in the areas mentioned by Beth, I vote stop recruitment at this time. If we do have needs, then I would recommend phone interview to clarify funding.

Just wondering what the opportunity is for Kathryn E. to get a job at the School of Nursing.  She is, as you well know, spectacularly good, and we would love to keep her here.  We will continue to have plenty of opportunity for her to work with us.
Any insight you might have would be welcome, and if you think a letter from me to anyone would be helpful, I would be happy to write one.
Best,

Thanks so much for your note. I hope you are well/happy and I appreciate your taking the time to be in touch. 
 
My involvement in the search process comes later on but I will forward your endorsement to those now reviewing the candidate pools. Given our growing population of persons with diabetes, we would love to add more endocrine experts to our faculty.

Dear Dean Gilliss
I wanted to send you a brief note about Kathryn Evans DNP, FNP-BC, who I know is very much interested in a position with the Duke School of Nursing.  She has had, I believe, an initial phone interview, and, should you be considering her further, I would be happy to write a formal letter of recommendation.  She is absolutely superb, and unquestionably ranks with the best FNPs I have ever had working with me in the clinical/clinical research arena.  She is extraordinarily bright and articulate, reads the literature, writes and lectures well, and is a very essential part of our research operation.  As you know, I have been doing this for a long time, and am not easily impressed, but my entire group, and indeed the entire Endocrinology Division, has the very highest regard for her.
Thanks for your time.
Kindest regards,
Mark

Crystal and Isaac,
This week I have reviewed our need for new positions in light of recent changes and needs for funding in the budget we are putting together for next year.

Unfortunately, we will not be able to proceed with hiring a second research track III position at this time. We will reconsider filling another research track III position next Fall.
It is fine to let the applicants we will be considering next Fall the need to add an additional research track III position.
