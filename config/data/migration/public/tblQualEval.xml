<qualitative>While this applicant sees few problems in transitioning to stat support for nursing studies, he was a  bit uninvolved in the interview process and had few questions. However, he was very interested in knowing the n ature and scope of our faculty external consultation policies. I would recommend both ref checks re: his cross-disciplinary research background and work habits and after that, a second visit before we decide if there is a fit with this position which would involve a great deal of internal collaboration as well as some teaching. .</qualitative>

<qualitative>This candidate appears to have good technical skills. However, it is unclear how enmthusiastic he is about coming to the School of Nursing. It is unclear exactly why he was purusing a faculty position at this stage of his life. On the other hand, it is clear that he does possess statistical knowledge and could either teach or assist faculty in writing grants. One wonders about the quality of either activity that he would provide. Most probably both would be &quot;adequate&quot;.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Based on a telephone interview conducted 11/4/08 I believe Dr. Snyder would contribute greatly in this position though his consultation and teaching in relevant areas.  His experience as a practicing dentist along with his interest in global health would be valuable additions to his major position focus.  He expressed commitment to students and enjoyment of the teaching and consultation role.  I would expect his role on grants and resulting publications to increase over time.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Overall evaluation:  Dr. Silva is a highly motivated and skilled professional.  She has demonstrated through grant work and publications, her statistical expertise in variety of studies, from RCTs that are multi-site in nature to one-site intervention studies. She has a solid foundation in longitudinal analysis.   I found her knowledge of statistical analysis as well as her interpersonal skills to be excellent.  She has taught courses in the past, and is excited about doing so again -- particularly in the PhD and DNP programs. Her record of providing statistical consultation to faculty, serving as the statistical co-investigator on faculty grants, and mentoring others is outstanding.   She has a realistic understanding of the needs of the School of Nursing and is excited about the possibility of joining the DUSON community.  Her connections within DCRI are strong, and she is interested in building stronger ties between DCRI and DUSON, perhaps through a fellowship program or joint research grant endeavors.  She has two concerns, both of which are reasonable.  First that she be given some time for her own research work  -- note she has one grant currently submitted as PI (r-hCuZnSOD for Preventing Chronic Respiratory Morbidity in Premature Infants); and second that we are clear on what her appointment in the SON as an Associate Research Professor would entail.  If the consensus is to hire, I would ask that the APT Committee be notified early -- and we can confirm the process.  
My recommendation is to hire Dr. Silva -- I think she will bring incredible skills, expertise and collegiality to our School.</qualitative>

If the cost is not too high, is probably worth a chance.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The candidate could not articulate a program of scholarship for this position in OGACHI.  When pressed about the 1-2 priorities she would address based on past experience, priority of need, past/current partnerships, the candidate presented the processes she would use to develop a plan.  Despite two different attempts, she could not address the opportunities for this position if selected.  At one point during the conversation, the candidate talked about the minimal resources available in gerontology and the excessive workloads expected of faculty her at DUSON.  When asked to clarify this statement, she clarified her statement stating that &quot;everyone seems so busy and those with gerontology experience already have a full plate.&quot;  Based on her CV, the candidate has limited experience in obtaining extramural funding. Most of the extramural funding she has listd on her CV have her as a research assistant.  Finally, when I asked her about why she is interested in leaving the Univ of Iowa where she is an associate professor with tenure and coming to DUSON, she could not articulate the 2-3 things that attracted her to Duke.  She only stated that Dr. Hewitt at the UWI encouraged her to apply for this position. The candidate&apos;s scholarly presentation was very difficult to follow and fragmented.  It was actually very difficult for me to understand what was the scope of her project.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I found Dr. Skemp to be pleasant and cordial with some global health experience emphasizing community care of the elderly. I did not get a sense of  her excitement or passion for the position of researcher scientist and program planner for international programs. Her elder care background closely resembles that of other faculty members, and I am not sure that she would fill a particular gap on the faculty because of the strong gero background of other faculty members. Her international experience and vulnerable populations work would probably prove helpful, but to the degree required for this position, I am not sure.</qualitative>

Two concerns that I have are:  1) she had difficulty clearly explaining her research agenda -- she was all over the map; 2) she had an extraordinary concern about keeping some of her work at the Iowa Global Institute.  The notion of having someone who can lead a strong research arm in OGACHI is critical -- it is the next step.  I am very uncertain that this candidate is the person who can do such.</qualitative>

I think in part because it was at the end of the lunch and we had talked a lot during lunch about different things.

<qualitative>I attended this faculty member&apos;s presentation on May 19th. Admittedly, I do not know much about community style intervention. What I can say is that I was not particularly impressed with the presentation. There were too many general comments made without many specifics. For example, I wanted to see how the interventions were more precisely implemented, some preliminary data given her emphasis on research, letting me know how what she has done and is doing addresses the main problems initially mentioned. I also found her to have an aura of arrogance, which was not appealing in this context.  She does seem to have a lot of expertise in public health nursing, is fairly well-published, lots of teaching experience and appears well connected. It also appears she has obtained success in generating funding --although not many recently and the funding amounts have been somewhat small. I hope these comments prove helpful.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I do not think he is a good match with the school.  He emphatically stated in his meeting with us that he did **NOT** want to teach nursing informatics; he would teach interdisciplinary informatics, but not nursing informatics.  He made several fairly extreme comments, one of which was that all current health care computerized systems/programs are awful and should be eliminated.  He wants to come in as a tenured assoc. prof., but in the list of &quot;Refereed Papers&quot; 20 of what are listed as papers are actually conference proceedings, so it appears that he is including podium presentations as refereed papers, which is incorrect.  Out of 48 &quot;refereed papers,&quot; 20 are conference proceedings.  Therefore he comes nowhere near meeting the criteria for assoc. prof with tenure.  He has had very little R level funding given the length of his career. He was unsure of where his primary appt. would be, but assured us he would be &quot;disruptive as hell.&quot;  He also said he is interested in doing &quot;as little as I can get away with.&quot;  While he may have been kidding about these 2 comments, they are not appropriate in a job interview in which you do not know anyone.  Finally, I am concerned about the amount of time he would be here, since he appears to be very close to retirement age. The comments above can be confirmed with Barb Turner who was in the same session.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I have no doubt that Dr. Turley has the knowledge needed to teach informatics and design data capturing and knowledge structures. However, I did not get the impression that he was specifically wanting to work at the Duke University School of Nursing. Rather his approach was that he perferred to work in any environment that could accommodate and welcome his philosophical views of what informatics needs to do; in this regard, any location that could support the initiation of such activities would be welcomed. I was rather annoyed by his response he gave to one question -- the specifics escape me other than I think it was involved with teaching -- of &quot;as little as possible.&quot; Also, his comment that he could be a &quot;distruptive force&quot; was not well received by me.  Overall, I found his motivating rather lacking and his heart not necessarily oriented towards nursing. As such, I do not see him as a good fit with with the DUSON.</qualitative>

<qualitative> I am not sure if he was nervous or just is normally arrogrant but when the APT members were discussing serious issues with him and seeking his input we got blown off  Example- what would you like to do if you come to Duke? - Answer: &quot;As little as I can get away with&quot;.  Q. How do you think you would approach working with interdisciplinary faculty?  Answer;  &quot;To be as disruptive as possible&quot;.  If these statements  were followed by a further explanation it would be one thing but it was the end of the conversation.   When I asked what positon he was applying for his answer was &quot;I have no idea I got a call to submit my CV&quot;
When it was noted that he had done some work with Constance he commented &quot;yes she was my student and I publish often with my student.(even though she was not his student when they published together.
There was no consideration of her as a colleague or a learned professional; she was in his mind a student of his.
He said very bizzare things.  eg &quot;all clinical software systems are crap only I know how to develop good systems&quot;; &quot;if you are looking for a nursing informatics faculty member that is not me- I do not believe in nursing informatics&quot;; &quot;I don’t care about faculty rank I only care about money&quot;.  
I followed up with what then was his intent in coming here and he said to devleop and lead an institute or a center (this is the first I ever heard of this).  His CV lists 48 referred papers yet fully 20 of them are abstracts (and since he is presenting at the same conferences I am I would not considered them to be referred abstracts!).  His presentation was not research, not extramurally funded and I was insulted when he showed a slide of the 4 presentations he prepared for his visit and then said - &quot;given what I know about the school I have decided to give the fourth presention&quot;  It was not research- how insulting to all faculty.  I also wanted to ask  what was behind &quot;doors 1-3&quot; on his opening slide. 
In his presentation he was very glib and did not take some questions seriously.  He had no answers or brushed off a number of the questions with a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; and no further explanation.. 
I have no sense of his research; his extramual funding is not impressive;he says he writes grants so his students will have something to do.  No sense of scholarship just a really inflated opinion of himself and I could not find justification for it.   My major concern is that he would not be a colleague of Constance&apos;s but he would forever see her as his student and treat her as such.  I strongly do not recommend him for faculty positino at the school.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Yes, with some significant reservations that would need to be addressed.  Dr. Turley has a unique vision and skill set related to interprofessional educational models for health informatics that would greatly contribute to the strategic development of our work in this area. And, he is very interested in teaching.  I question his commitment to working as part of a team versus prefering to work alone and his frequent position changes and relatively limited recent funding are additional concerns.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Turley does not believe in Nursing Informatics. As a recent graduate of  DUSON NI program, I have conflicting feelings about this. If the program is to turn into a general health informatics program, I am not sure how many nurses will be able to come into the program or compete in IT arena. Nurses are uniquely positioned to contribute in healthcare IT as liasons between IT and clinical care. It would be a shame if nurses were to lose the opportunity for a formal informatics education as only nurses could at DUSON.</qualitative>

I don&apos;t see him bringing leading edge ideas to our informatics program  so my vote is no -- but I will defer to those in informatics on this.  His CV is not straight forwarded -- for example he has proceedings mixed in with articles, and lists doctoral students that he mostly likely consulted with -- but was not a committee member.  He and I talked about such -- and I think he would quickly redo his cv to fit Duke criteria.  I liked him -- but don&apos;t think he is a match with what we need.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr Turley brings the background experience needed for a faculty member in nursing informatics. His interdisciplinary experience is particularly beneficial because of the direction the informatics specialty will most likely take in the future.  However, he is somewhat out of touch with the external drivers impacting  nursing curricula, i.e.,  consensus document, 2015 recommendations, this is probably because he has not worked in a nursing school for a while.  My overall, impression was positive and believe he would be an acceptable fit for DUSON</qualitative>

<qualitative>#4 - Her knowledge of prelicense curriculum is excellent but she does not have knowledge of the other programs.  However, she seems to thrive on working with curriculum development and I think she would quickly gain knowledge in other programs.  She definitely has been a &quot;utility&quot; faculty member at Watts and I think she would be an effective team member.  I am impressed with her self-developed knowledge in psych nursing even though she had no formal preparation or clinical experience in psych.  As you can see, I think her presentation was excellent - one of the best I have attended of candidates through the years.  Based on the APT committee members&apos; discussions with her, I don&apos;t see her as a tenure track candidate.  She was emphatic about being an educator.  Not that she couldn&apos;t continue her reseaerch area of interest, but I am not sure that it is fundable and she has no record of securing grants.  I think she aligns well with clinical track.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I was impressed by Dr. Ward&apos;s presentation and her ability to lecture.  I was discouraged when I met with her as a small group.  She shared that she saw no real place for the DNP degree and thought that it was a mistake for the profession.  Also, when asked about classroom issues that could arise with our very bright, challenging students, she chose to use sarcasm with them as an example of how to handle the group.  I am afraid that wouldn&apos;t go over well with these students.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I was sorry to have missed Dr Ward&apos;s presentation but appreciated the opportunity to meet with her in a small group along with other faculty. She is very pleasant and dedicated to the profession of nursing. She described the work she has most recently done, which is quite extensive, in terms of curricular revision in the Watts nursing program. However, I continually struggled with the fact that their associates degree program is clearly going to be different than the ABSN program and the issues are different as well. In addition, I was very surprised to find that she gave the impression of great excitement and pride in the work they had completed at Watts and the new program changes that would roll out this fall; yet when discussing the position here at DUSON, that level of excitement was missing. I didn&apos;t know how to interpret this, other than to ask myself why she would leave a program she had worked so hard to develop at a time when they were about to implement the changes which she seemed passionate about. 
In discussing this with other DUSON faculty, I am concerned that Dr Ward did not seem to wish to pursue her research any farther - although a clinical position may seem to allow this, I think that our clinical faculty are still involved in various innovative, collaborative projects and did not get the sense she would contribute to that environment. In general, I felt that Dr Ward was very pleasant, clearly has a good rapport with her current students, and is dedicated to nursing. I still as mentioned above, would have concerns about what she would bring to the faculty and students here at DUSON in terms of a unique or additive contribution to such an innovative, energetic, expanding environment.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Until I heard her research presentation, I did not think she would be a good candidate for the SON.  Even so, I do not think she will pursue her work in psych research -- but her research presentation was solid and she had a real command of the audience.  This candidate is a good person.  She is authentic.  Her expertise in psych comes from teaching in that area and from her doctoral dissertation.  Her keen interest is in education.  She was clear about this.  It all comes down to, what does the SON want and need?  If we are in search of faculty with science -- I do not think Dr. Ward fits the bill.  If we are seeking a solid teacher and a good citizen then she does.  I will defer to the ABSN faculty -- I hope we will weigh in on the ratio of clinical to tenure track faculty.  Dr. Ward is clearly a clinical track faculty member -- most likely at the assistant professor level.  I personally like her.  The questions is one of match and SON goals.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr Ward is a mature, seasoned educator and clinician with excelllent experience in classroom and clinical teaching.  Her background demonstrates leadership activities within the profession of nursing and in the community.  As a new PHD, she describes herself as a novice researcher, yet she presented an  excellent, scholarly piece of research with implications for patient care and education. I can envision Dr. Ward&apos;s clinical research having impact and the ability to attract funding as it relates to the segment of the mental health population she studies.  Her psychiatric nursing skills/competencies fill a void in our faculty. It would be our loss, if we could not convince this lady to become part of DUSON&apos;s faculty.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Ward was a very nice woman and a lovely presenter. It was certainly a topic that I did not know much about and was informed by what she had to say. That being said, Dr. Ward gives an impression of not being very sophisticated in her overall demeanor and would hence provides me an impression of not being of the caliber of the other PhD&apos;s that we seem to attract here at DUSON. I would imagine that she is okay in the classroom but I also wonder if she would be on par with other doctorally prepared faculty and even with our ABSN students? She just does not resonate as someone that would &quot;fit&quot; with our academic culture. It is concerning to see on her resume the associations with NC Central since tha program has had marginal performance over the years and she lists herself as a consultant. She has many things on her resume (presentations) that were at her church or with her employer. I guess it makes me question her overall professional development.   She also has very few publications and indicated in at least one conversation that she does not desire to be on the tenure track here due to not wanting to work at that level. Which makes me wonder, how much she would contribute the the research enviornment here? It would seem that she might be a better fit at a University that is not so research/publication intensive.  We only have 5 positions to hire. I would recommend that we pass on Dr. Ward and wait it out for a candidate that from the onset, would be adding scholorship to our mix in the ABSN program as well as the overall contributions at the doctoral level.  I do not recommend that she be hired.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Ward is a lovely woman and did a nice job presenting her dissertation research. I appreciate being given the opportunity to hear her presentation and to meet with her in a small group format. However, I am of the opinion that Dr. Ward would not be a good addition to the DUSON faculty at any level or in any role. Her CV suggests a lack of significant experience of the caliber expected of Du ke faculty. Her only teaching experience has been in a diploma program, except for some remidiation work related to NCLEX review/preperation.She has one publication, 2 pages in length, although she indicates that her dissertation work is in progress. She has a very limited number of presentations of national or even statewide significance. More than half of the presentations she has listed have either been made at churches or her places of employment, while both are important venues they suggest a lack of significant professional development or comittment one would expect of a Duke faculty. While such a significant lack of professional or scholarly contributions could be overlooked in a less seasoned educator, I would expect more from a person at Dr. Ward&apos;s point in career development. In meeting with her after her presentation I found it concerning that she is interested in a clinical track position because she &quot;has a lot going on in (her) life and does not want to have to worry about funding and publications&quot;. That statement, matched with a  CV rather weak in professional substance, causes me to wonder what level of contribution this candidate will make at Duke. While I enjoyed Dr. Ward&apos;s presentation I found that it lacked the intellectual sophistcation or intrigue one might expect from a faculty member at Duke. I left feeling that her understanding of her subject matter and methodology were rather basic for a doctorally prepared academician and that the dissertation had been more driven by process and necessity than by a spirit of intellectual inquiry. There was no &quot;wow factor&quot; to the presentation nor could I find much value in her studies results or her explanation of how they might inform practice or education. 
I know that we are facing a serious and pressing need for additional ABSN faculty, however I hope that we will not allow that to influence hiring decisions when a candidate is not adequately prepared or qualified to be on faculty at Duke. Our students expect and deserve faculty who, in addition to having doctoral education,  have made some level of significant contributions to our profession through both scholarship and leadership. Despite the fact that Dr. Ward appears to be a lovely woman, I have significant concerns about her ability to make more than mediocre academic and intellectual contributions here at Duke. I have concerns that she may not be academically or intellectually on par with our students, and most of the faculty at DUSON or Duke.  I am hopeful that we will continue to look for faculty who can not only foster the intellectual development of our students but also make significant scholarly contributions toward the enhancement of DUSON&apos;s reputation as a leading academic institution.   To that end we need  faculty, who like our students, are exceptional rather than mediocre or average.  Unfortunately, I don&apos;t believe Dr. Ward rises to that level.</qualitative>

<qualitative> Dr Ward has wonderful experience in a diploma program.  Her research is very interesting and she seems to be a delightful individual.   When challenges arise within the ABSN program, in the class room and in clinical,one successful strategy is to fall back on clinical experience.  Dr Ward does not have the clinical experience to fall back on and thus I believe she will find there are challenges she has not thought of.</qualitative>

<qualitative>During Dr. Granger&apos;s presentation and in our separate meeting, it is clear she has a strong sense of what translational nursing research is and has developed a very strong model for developing a depth and breadth of nursing research aimed at evidence-based practice. She has done so by engaging, training, and mentoring hospital nurses and fostering strong relationships with researchers in the school of nursing. She has been successful with modest resources but recognizes the impact that greater infrastructure and resources can have in transforming translational research goals. Dr. Granger&apos;s vision is centered on high-impact and innovative target areas in cardiovascular care, which matches well with the expertise at Duke University and the Medical Center, and will help to strengthen the School&apos;s involvement in this area. Her model for building translational research can also be extended to other core areas, such as oncology, health care services/outcomes, neonatal/pediatric and aging research, to name a few. She is keenly focused on developing the DNTI as a conduit for which bedside nurses, researchers/faculty, students, postdoc trainees, and multidisciplinary colleagues) can synthesize knowledge, experience, and effort towards common goals. Her experience, knowledge, and connections at Duke University and Duke Health System also make her well-positioned to lead our vision for the DNTI. I think Dr. Granger is an excellent candidate for this position and is likely to be highly successful in DTNI endeavors.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The topic she presented (genetics) was not her research.. I suppose since she is looking at a clinical track appointment she was given direction to present a class. What this candiate brings ( I do not know her personally, so this is a CV review and attednig her presentation) is an expert clinician who can infuse clinical examples into her teaching.  She has a good track record of team publications, obvious team collagboration in practice settings and has experience as a teacher (adjunct fauclty).  I would recommend hiring her or at least a second interview. I am sorry there was not an opportunity for the peds faculty to meet with her to see how she would fit in with our teaching, research and service misson.  Did she think it was odd not to meet with peds faculty?  I hope she did not think we were being rude. Perhaps she can meet with us when/if she is brought back for a second round interview. Because of ther strong practice base she would be a nice addition to the DNP faculty (capstone and N651) or to the MSN faculty (peds courses).</qualitative>

1. Could Dr Wise be strong enough in a classroom setting to control order of the 76 students ( or however many)  or would they run over her?  she has the peds knowledge and experience in the advanced practice role but am not sure now about her classroom presence 
2. How would Dr Carter be able to teach peds with no peds experience?  All her experience is as NICU thus she has no well of knowledge to use as clinical exemplars to explain concepts.
We have 2 DNP peds students who will graduate in May 09; they might be queried for their interest as they have clinical experiences as PNPs and I think would have classroom presence; one has taught for us before.</qualitative>

She has been on the edge of cutting edge research and genetics in the care of children with cancer. Not only could she teach pediatrics, but with the anticipation of the new ABSN curriculum redevelopment she has knowledge that could be applied in adult health, foundations, pathophysiology and certainly pediatrics. Should she be offered the position she would balance out the ABSN faculty by being another strong researcher to join Relf, Brion &amp; Bailey…and to balance out Martin, Gordon, Phillips, Turner. I think we not only need this depth and breath…but her enthusiasm and professional credentials.  I quite enjoyed my time with her during the presentation, 1:1, ABSN faculty time and dinner. I see her being a very ++ addition to DUSON and to the ABSN core group. 
     Where she is going to need some effort is to reaquaint herself with the role/skills of the bedside nurse and the issues in pediatrics. It is important that she not teach the peds material from the platform of an advanced practice nurse, but rather from the generalist perspective. She has been out of nursing education for some time so if hired, orientation needs to include time in the hospital shadowing peds nurses as well as time in classroom instruction for large groups of students. I think she is quite up to the challenge and would do a fine job with our students as she is accomplished, seasoned and an expert in her field. I am especially encouraged by what she would bring to our students as it relates to her firm grounding in genetics and genomics. I would welcome her as a colleague and hope the committee and the Dean will giver her a serious evaluation for the ABSN position. I very much can see her here. I strongly support her hire.
***As a side note, I think in time she would also have cross-over with the DNP program and the peds acute care NP program. I know this is not what she is being hired for…and due to her extensive background she would provide us with many options to use her knowledge and skills in cancer and pediatrics, perhaps allowing us to develop a program in post-graduate genetics for niurses or attract doctoral and DNP students with genetics interests.….as has been said, she would give us &quot;depth to the bench!&quot;</qualitative>

<qualitative>I really liked this candidate.  She has incredible experience -- as a practitioner, working in interdisciplinary research teams, and in education.  She also has experience in working with professional national organizations.  I found her to be thoughtful, knowledgable about current clinical issues and clear about what she could contribute to the ABSN program.  She also asked about possibilities in other programs (in the semester the peds course wasn&apos;t offered in the ABSN program).  I think she could bring real strength to the DNP program (and we need more faculty here) as well as to the ACPNP program.  She had real ideas about a research program that is important -- and could be conducted at Duke.  I don&apos;t often get excited about a candidate -- but  I found Dr. Wise exciting.  I hope we can recruit her to Duke.  As the APT chair -- I did spend time with her regarding clinical and tenure track --  I think she could fit in either track depending upon her discussion with the dean.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I am very excited about this candidate. While I was not impressed with her presentation (lacking in depth and seemed very nervous), I feel that this candidate has an enormous wealth and breadth of experience that DUSON could really benefit from. She is an excellent clinician and has some very good teaching experience. She is not only a terrific candidate for the ABSN position, but she will also fit in very well across many programs such as the peds acute care program (which has a lot of room for growth) and the DNP program.  This pediatric candidate is very special because she has experience caring for children across the pediatric life-span.  We have several peds faculty that are neonatal experts. We have fewer peds faculty that have expericence (teaching and research), across the the pediatric life-span.  I think that our teaching needs (both in ABSN and across other programs) are for a person with experience across the pediatric life-span.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The candidate was personable and her CV indicates that she has authored considerable publications. However, her presentation here was average/fair. We have faculty and guest lecturers who present similar content to our students in a much more polished and engaging way.   I want to suggest strongly to the search committee that it would be a more helpful strategy overall to have candidates meet also with faculty who have similar clinical skills sets. While I appreciate that the current need is for a pediatric ABSN faculty member, it has been the philosophy of DUSON that faculty teach across programs and we teach clinical content in each other&apos;s courses. Members of the pediatric faculty should have been invited more formally (i.e., scheduled) to interact with the candidate to explore common interests.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Please note:  I indicated UNABLE TO SAY because it depends on where we thinkg Dr. Wise can contribute and whether we need capacity in those areas…Dr. Wise is a talented and experienced clinician with several episodes of teaching experience.  She seemed more eager to move away from her current work than entranced with becoming an academic; however, she has demonstrated scholarly abilities in participating in research and writing that would serve her well as a new regular rank faculty.  I believe the change to a general pediatrics focus in the ABSN program would be a significant change for her, and while there certainly would be opportunities for her to pursue her clinical research interests, from the ABSN position perspective the majority of her work would be in community and general pediatrics.  While her presentation style could be enhanced, it was a topic of importance and she demonstrated some core pedagogical skills related to developing interest, logical flow, etc.  She did however try to cover way too much information in too much detail and that detracted from the session.  Dr. Wise&apos;s background in oncology would be of value to the school as would her PNP credential and experience, which if capacity were needed could be of value in the MSN and potentially DNP programs. And if she has true interest in returning to an expanded pedi focus, I think she could be a successful new faculty. Dr. Wise wasn&apos;t certain of whether she wished to pursue a clinical or tenure track.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The candidate has only secured on major grant since completing her PhD in 1992.  She is uncertain about her future research directions and indicated she wants to move away from the menapause research.  Her presentation was average.  A concern is that there were at least 2 spelling errors in her slides.

<qualitative>I have never seen another professional act in such an inappropriate way on an interview. From &quot;trashing&quot; her interium dean, the University of Texas School of Nursing, her colleagues at UT, the &quot;toxic&quot; enviornment in which she works to the voluminious amounts of comments regarding her personal life: her &quot;disappointing&quot; 19 year old son who married a woman in Nevada and only spent 6 days with this woman, to her primary dysfunctional family of orgin (chemical dependency) to comments about her insulin pump, her gastric band, etc., etc. I think something is terribly wrong and &quot;off&quot;  with Dr. Dormire&apos;s motivations for wanting to leave UT….and I think from spending and observing her in 4 different venues during her interview time that her motivations are to leave UT, end of story. Where she goes and what she does, I am venturing are of little importance to her. Duke would represent a possible vehicle to achieve her primary goal: that of leaving UT. It should be noted that Dr. Dormier has an odd career trajectory (Staff Nurse Position in 2005) while at UT (which she said was done for &quot;financial reasons&quot;). Additionally, it would seem that either her research is over…or she has lost interest in her current topic…as her funding is spent and her plans for additional funding are sketchy at best. She is bringing no research dollars with her. She also mentioned that she is tenured at UT, but her resume does not indicate that….and that she would expect to come here tenured was inappropriate to be discussed in the interview situations in which I observed her. She seemed much more interested in how much money she would be making, where she could do her work (home vs office) than she was in the worklife at DUSON, the kinds of students we have in this program or how we all work together? It seemed most of the interview was solely about her and her wants/needs. To say this interview experience was &quot;odd&quot; would be an understatement!  I do not doubt that she has a love of teaching….but her current experience has been at the master&apos;s and doctoral level. It did not seem upon questioning that her that her interest was with our population of students…but rather this position would be a way for her to remove herself from her &quot;toxic&quot; enviornment. If it were not bad enough how she conducted herself on this interview what was even more concerning is that she seemed to have no awareness regarding how inappropriate it was to be talking about her previous employer and all the highly personal information that she shared to anyone who would listen! Dr. Dormier is extremely out of touch. I felt she left this experience thinking that she would be offered the position and this interview went well. I have never seen a person do so much talking…and so little listening. In many ways, she is a very sad woman. 
There is no question in my mind that she is not a fit at all for DUSON. I would be embarassed to have her as a colleague and I can&apos;t see how she would make a contribution to our program….as her motives for coming are not in sync with our needs.  I would be afraid her unprofessional behavior, her totally unaware manners would poorly reflect on DUSON. I think what we saw is but a &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; as it regards this woman&apos;s dysfunction both professionally and personally.  Under no circumstances should Dr. Dormier be hired.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think this candidate has some very interesting research.  However her presentation style was terrible, and it was difficult to keep from falling asleep.  She read her whole presentation and could not stay on target if she lost her place.  I would assume that someone teaching in front of a large class would easily loose the attention of her students.  I don’t think she would be a good fit for our ABSN program.  Another drawback is that she does not have acute in hospital experience.  She might be able to teach primary care pediatrics but her teaching effectiveness was not portrayed by her presentation. I don’t see a fit for any of our programs.

<qualitative>The candidate seemed professional and personable in her interactions with others. I attended the presentation, lunch and a very short meeting with the pediatric faculty. Dr. Caines read a script during the presentation rather than speaking from her slides. She explained that she did not want to forget anything so she would be reading from a script--just as a podium presenter might do. This was distracting and was not well suited to a small room with just several attendees. The presentation was much too long for the time allotted so Dr. Caines skipped over sections in order to be able to complete it. I am concerned that this may be an example of her teaching style. I suggest that the committee gather more evidence about her teaching effectiveness.  The meeting with the pediatric faculty raised more questions than answers for me. There was not enough time allotted to assess Dr. Caines&apos; knowledge about pediatric content. When asked about how current she is with inpatient pediatrics, Dr. Caines explained that she has had little inpatient pediatric clinical experience. She said that she worked in obstetrics for 2 years and had experience with newborns. Currently, she is working in two school based health clinics. Dr. Caines stated that she keeps up to date on pediatric issues by going to weekly grand rounds. She explained that the didactic and the clinical pieces of the undergraduate pediatric course she is teaching are separate. The pediatric faculty asked Dr. Caines to clarify her PNP certification because we did not recognize the name of the certification board on her CV. Dr. Caines incorrectly identified the board on her CV as the &quot;Certification Board of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners&quot;. The name of the board at the time of her certification was the &quot;National Board of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners and Associates&quot;. The board changed its name and is now the Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (2005). As for professional organizations, Dr. Caines explained that she belonged to the Society of Adolescent Medicine rather than NAPNAP or AFPNP because it better fits her interest area. Another concern is that Dr. Caines lists a number of published abstracts as &quot;publications&quot; on her CV and 2 1/2 pages of her CV contain professional development meetings she attended. My greatest concern relates to information that I discovered when &quot;googling&quot; Dr. Caines because I didn&apos;t recognize her name. The first and second weblinks that I found were her ratings from USM and URI on www.ratemyprofessor.com. The ratings were simply awful and the comments were very concerning (e.g., weak knowledgebase, disrespectful to students, condescending, psychologically damaging, inflexible). Perhaps the evaluations do not truly reflect her teaching effectiveness. I hope that the committee will do some due diligence in sorting this out should the candidate be seriously considered. I would not recommend to offer her a position until we have further information about her teaching effectiveness.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Caines appears to posses a valuable blend of  strong clinicical, research and educational skills. While her teaching skills are difficult to evaluate through conversation/CV alone, her questions and conversation around teaching suggest that she is a progressive educator who challenges students to push their limits in the classroom. I believe she would infuse the academic environment at DUSON with some new and novel approaches to educating the ABSN student. In conversation and through her research presentation, Dr. Caines was able to demonstrate a level of intellectual curiosity that will undoubtedly motivate her to advance her research and make significant contributions to nursing science in the areas of pediatrics and public health/health promotion. Her experience with several highly regarded nursing programs, her obvious intelligence and her desire to engage in a program of interdisciplinary research are strengths that would enhance not only the ABSN program but also DUSON and Duke University. In addition to her valuable clinicical, research and educational skill set, Dr. Caines appears to be a genuinely nice person who appeared comfortable with both small group interaction and a larger, more formal presentation setting. She engaged in conversation with a very appropriate balance of questions about the DUSON community and sharing of herself. I believe she would be a very good fit with both the DUSON community  and the ABSN Program.Thank you for providing the opportunity to meet this candidate, kudos to all involved!</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Caines will be a strong candidate for the ABSN program. She has experience with teaching entry level nurses. My main concern is that she has little interface with the acute care side of pediatric nursing which most of our ABSN students go into. She has not coordinated CIs in the recent past (once at a former position).  She will need some guidance from Duke faculty. My only other concern would be her integration with other programs besides strictly ABSN. She did not have a recent grasp of the current issues facing PNPs and is NOT a member of the PNP organization, NAPNAP since she is a PNP. We asked her about this and she said it was financial.  It just seemed a bit odd since she is very interested in adolescents and NAPNAP has a lot of support for practitioners invovled with adolscents and generates much of the science on this population. She also incorrectly listed her certification organization on her CV - she erroneously wrote the certification body name.  Sharron asked her about this and she did not realize the name was wrong. Hopefully this was an oversite - however, I would think it would be good for us to verify she indeed has a current certification through the PNCB (Pediatric Nursing Certification Board) either by asking her to provide a current copy of her card or we can verify online for $30.  I called the PNCB today to ask them and they told me to go about it above. Overall, I think she is a strong candidate for the ABSN position and for the school. She just seemed a bit out of touch with current acute care practice which is fine as long as she is willing to work closely with the acute care CIs and managers.</qualitative>

<qualitative>This seems like a very good fit for the ABSN Program. She has a focus on teaching normal pediatrics, family development and growth and development. I like tha she is both interested in research and prides herself on innovation in the classroom. Karen seems quite excited about the intellectual capacities of our ABSN students. While her research is definitely not &quot;mainstream&quot; she has an excellent grasp of what she can do to make her interest more suitable for funding. Having another researcher in the group would be very stimulating. I liked her professional style, her questions were very appropriate and she displayed a sincere interest in DUSON and demonstrated a good grasp of what is happening here. I think our students would love her style, her evidence based approach to pediatrics and the blend she would bring of both research, evidence focused care and her innovation in teaching.

<qualitative>This candidate appears to be a good fit for the ABSN program. She is able to describe some innovative methods for teaching this special population. She seems to be aware of her limitations and has well thought out plans on how to fill in these areas.  At this point, she does not seem to be a good fit for the PNP programs.  She has little interaction with profesesional organizations that support PNPs. She seems to be pleasant, likable and collegiate.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think Kay will be a good match for the ABSN program and the need for a faculty member with a designated expertise in community health. I did not hear from her when she will be finished with her MPH…and I do think some possible overlap may exist between what she sees as our community course and what she may have been teaching as a health promotion/disease prevention course. These areas seem to me to be very easy to clear up with the articulation of program and course objectives. I think it will be very important if steps are taken to move forward with her hire that she first understand her priority is teaching in the ABSN Program. She articulated several times about Duke being a &quot;candy store&quot; of opportunities…and I think without focus both Kay and some of her colleagues (Global Health) could fragment her focus. The need is clear in the ABSN Program and it is important that she understand first that she is coming to fill that need, if in fact, that is the job?   While her presentation seemed very circular and at times not focused, it did provide a sense of her expertise and her presentation style. I think students will find her both approachable and able to provide the expertise that is needed in this content area.
It is important to note if steps go forward that she did express concern at several points in the visit about the community course moving from a 3 semester sequence to a one semester course. Reassurance was given regarding threading the material through courses….while I do not sense this is a &quot;deal breaker&quot; for her, she brought it up several times (maybe just to confirm the position???). But worth noting.
I found her to be genuine and very interested in the program. I do not think she got enough time to explore the community, but she seems very interested in what is occuring at Duke. I would welcome the opportunity to have her as a colleague.</qualitative>

<qualitative>This candidate was an incredible disappointment. Not only was her affect flat, or below flat (and I do not think it had anything to do with her late flight arrival), she is NO MATCH for the needs of the ABSN program. She would be totally out of sync with the other faculty and esp. with the faculty with whom she would be teaching the most: Helen Gordon. Dr. Pritham demonstrated good technical understanding of women&apos;s health content but her examples of delivery demonstrated no creativty and little application to the needs of students. It was concerning that early in her visit when ask &quot;why Duke, why now in your career?&quot; Her response was that she &quot;wanted less contact with students and more time for her research.&quot; It demonstrated to me that she had not read the job description and was not sophisticated enough to understand the issues with meeting Duke&apos;s needs before her own.   
I was very concerned after her presentation. She presented old statistics, spend 40 minutes providing her audience with the background of her study (some of which was not about maternal addiction) and then spent less than 10 minutes on her results. After seeing her &quot;matched cohort&quot; study…I could see why she only spent 10 minutes on her results…one group had 138 subjects, the other 16. Hardly a &quot;matched&quot; sample! Perhaps she underestimates the level of research we are use to hearing about? But as bad was her presentation style: heavy text powerpoint, flat affect delivery, no excitement about her content, she laid her remote down with each slide which made for a constant motion in her presentation that was distracting. It was so poorly done…and I thought if this in any way is an example of how she presents to students, she would lose our bright students in the first 5 minutes. I think as an ABSN faculty we are working hard to improve the scholarship of teaching at Duke. To add a member to our faculty who so clearly is not interested nor probably capable of pushing her teaching skills, would be a big mistake. As one of the people who would be her immediate faculty colleague, I felt no synergy, no connection with this woman like I did with Dr. Karen Caines and Kay who was in 2 weeks ago. This woman DOES NOT FIT. She is not of the caliber that mirrors other faculty capabilities at Duke. She mentioned several examples of what she truly believed was innovation in teaching, things like: streaming videos into Blackboard, using CD roms from the textbook, developing study guides to &quot;send students to the simulation lab.&quot; She actually is so out of touch she thought this was INNOVATION! When ask how she decides what content to include in a course she says, &quot;Oh, I have moved content around over the years, but now I just follow the textbook!&quot; 
I rather imagine for the university that she teaches in, that she may &quot;stand out&quot; as a very committed teacher who works very hard. Her described teaching load is horrific…and I do not doubt that she wants to pursue her research and relieve herself of some of the mundane tasks she is responsible for (site procurement, student immunizations, CI training, etc). There might have been a time in the evolution of the ABSN Program that her skills and approach might have been a match? But unfortunately for her, we have evolved over the last four years to a level that her deficiencies and her traditional approach of teaching would be glaring. She said many times over the course of the various venues that &quot;I just do not feel I have done my job if I do not give students everything I can give them.&quot; This was described as a very &quot;additive&quot; approach…with little discrimination from her on what is relevent and salient. Not at all the way we approach content in courses now…and teaching accelerated students (of which she has no experience).  
We do not have to take just anybody. We can wait and keep looking for the caliber of person who will bring us something special and unique to add to this mix of faculty that are here and who have been hired. Someone who has developed a level of creativity and innovation in their teaching that our faculty will be energized and our students enriched. 
We have the time to wait and search for a top-notch candidate. Dr. Pritham, is not the one.  I cannot see her at Duke and would not be happy, in fact, I would be very upset if she were added to the faculty mix, in particular to the ABSN Program. She would add a great deal of controversary to our group and in many ways she could &quot;drag down&quot; the progress that has been made, both the interpersonal balance we have achieved in the last 1.5 years as well as setting back the progress made in the scholarship of teaching.   I do not support her hire.</qualitative>

I am assuming that this position is administrative.  With her vision &amp; connections &amp; experience, I would say that if the position is indeed administrative (over Citadl), I would definitely urge recruitment. But if the position is for faculty position, then I would definitely say no to recruitment, because I am not really sure what she would teach &amp; what she could offer our students or how she could best share the faculty teaching load.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The issue here is not the candidate&apos;s ability -- it is the position she would be assuming.  The SON needs to come to grips with the fact that CITDL reports to the business office, the Educational Institute is hanging out there -- and then we would have yet another Center.  The structure is absolutely ineffective.  Lots of activity -- not coordinated -- looks good -- Rome burns.   If we bring on this Center -- with a director that has no real authority over the technological resources of the SON or of the &quot;educational institute&quot; -- well we will have little impact on the productivity of faculty in delivering the best online education, or employing any set of innovative tools, or of integrated pedological technology.  Will we have another stand alone Center that does some stuff that most faculty don&apos;t know about or engage in.  The Director may do quite well personally -- reaching out to the university or nationally -- but he/she won&apos;t impact the productivity or excellence of the SON in meeting its strategic plan in leading in educational technology.  Might look good -- but not make a significant contribution in terms of what we do or deliver.  I thought Dr. Lombardi was quite good.  I would hire her.  I do think this is more of a staff position than a faculty position.  However, if we offer her a faculty position -- the clinical track is most appropriate, and she may be at the level of associate clinical professor -- although we would need a cv rather than a business resume to make that decision.  No doubt structure is not a search committee issue -- but I hope that somehow -- this issue is looked at.   We have hard woking individuals in the different areas - CITDL, the Educational Institute -- but we have no coordination, no synergy, no vision.  And this Center is just more of the same. Please recommend a unified structure -- bring it in to academics.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think that Dr. Lombardi is a good candidate for the DAST position.  Her interpersonal skills and communication style are exactly what I feel is needed for this position.  While I do not have the background to adequately guage her academic qualifications, I can speak to her technical preparation for the position as I understand it.  I feel that Dr. Lombardi has good ideas and she has clearly put some deep thought into what we need from this position.  She demonstrates a great deal of experience with the theoretical concepts surrounding the educational technology field, as well having proven herself as an established leader among those who specialize in this area.  Her published work is comprehensive and has the breadth that I think we would expect from someone with her connections.  With the credibility that she has earned from her work in the field, I was disappointed that I did not see examples of where Dr. Lombardi demonstrated the ability to move theory into practice.  I may have missed it or she may have had more fruitful conversations with other interviewers, but I was hoping to see instances where she had come into an institution as an observer or consultant, then put into place something that would demonstrate the long-term effectiveness of her ideas.  From my brief interview with her, as well as what I learned from her on-site lecture, I saw some interesting and thought-provoking ideas, but I didn&apos;t see where she had actually used them in any practical applications.  In my opinion, this isn&apos;t a show-stopper, but something we need to keep in mind as she begins working with us.  
I think we could learn a lot from Dr. Lombardi.  She brings some great ideas, connections and theoretical background to the table.  If we implement some of the designs that she presented, I feel we will be moving our school into a much better position.  But if our expectation is that she &quot;hit the ground running&quot; and move us quickly into a new era of  applying technology to education, I don&apos;t see where she has proven her ability to place theory into practice.  It will take time for her to develop skills and strategies that will work on the ground.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I don&apos;t feel the criteria in the above matrix encompass the skills needed for this position. She is not going to fully understand the curriculum issues across the programs but is fully capable of understanding. While I can see the possibility of concerns that Marilyn&apos;s research has been tightly focused as well as primarily being published by Educause (not sure if peer reviewed), I don&apos;t know the degree that is a negative for this position.  In looking at the big picture of what Marilyn offers and believe it is a package of skills that will be difficult to fill by someone not already a part of Duke. She possesses the technical savvy, interest, and application to learning that is needed. She has been a professor and can relate to both academics and technologists. She understands the significance of strategy and process needed to be successful. I felt Marilyn displayed the strong desire to do the DAST role where she would wholeheartedly serve the School. I feel she would be committed and work towards the greater good.  She is definitely a visionary and will help broaden  our thoughts and views on teaching with technology. The only thing I could not get a sense of was her ability to project manager--being practical. Although, the practical can be managed by someone else. Therefore, I feel she would do right by us and recommend to hire her. It couldn&apos;t hurt, though, to bring her back and really focus on the areas that seem to be weaker for her. I usually prefer to have other candidates to compare to and still think it is a good idea to do so. If for some reason that is not possible,  I am comfortable with her as the choice candidate.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think that Karen would be an excellent match for the position that she is applying for as well as for a tenure track faculty position. She has some clear goals regarding shaping her career as a researcher and while she is at the novice stage she is very bright and will be very responsive to mentoring.  Karen has an excellent national reputation as a pediatric acute care NP. She has been on the cutting edge of curriculum design and certification efforts in this field since its inception.  She would be able to teach a wide range of courses across the peds MSN program and peds ABSN program. Karen is co-editor of the first Pediatric Acute Care Multidisciplinary Text book that is scheduled to be released in early 2011. It would be a real feather in the school&apos;s cap to have the Duke University School of Nursing Pediatric Acute Care Program associated with this Co-Editor&apos;s name.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Reuter-Rice is an ideal candidate for the position for the Specialty Director for the Pediatric Acute/Chronic Care specialty. As a former faculty member who helped to grow this specialty at Duke, I would be proud to have Dr. Reuter-Rice take the baton from Dr. Docherty.  I have known Dr. Reuter-Rice professionally for the past 4 years from pediatric acute care meetings and professional work.  She is well respected on a national level, has a solid clinical foundation, and has emerging research potential which would benefit Duke. She has tremendous energy and enthusiasm.  Her energy may come across as overconfidence, but she is very reasonable to work with.  I have also worked with her recently on the book she a co-editor for (as a chapter contributor).  She has been very responsive and timely in responding to questions and edits for this important text for our profession.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I very much support the hiring of Karen Reuter-Rice as a faculty member for the Peds Acute &amp; Chronic Care NP program.  Karen is very grounded in clinical practice and in the professional role development of ACPNPs.  She is active in NP organizations at both the local and national level. I believe both her clinical and academic background are well suited for this faculty position. She articulates a very clear vision for a position that integrates academics, research, and clinical practice, making her a very desirable candidate.  I have no doubt she will be very collaborative with the SON and DUHS, and would advocate for consideration of a potentially split-funded position between the school and hospital to support her in maintaining her clinical skills (which gives her credibility, visibility, and knowledge that I believe is essential for this position).   Thank you for inviting me to participate in her interviews and iin her scholarly presentation.</qualitative>

She has successfully, led a pediatric NP program in 2 other universities and is able to offer realistic, innovative ideas for solving some of the issues facing the pediatric specialty (i.e., recruitment &amp; admissions, clinical site development).   She understands the need to sell her ideas (i.e. online acute care peds track) to involved stakeholders and how best to go about doing so.

Dr. Reuter-Rice has some strong opinions and would be a good advocate for the school and the program. I believe her program development may not stop with the school, she&apos;d be a great resource for AC-PNPs in the hospital as well. If we grow a strong academic program for AC-PNPs, we will benefit not only the school, but enhance the AC-PNP programs in the hospital. This will work to our advantage for recruiting students into the program, building strong clinical relationships for to use as precepted sights for the students, and ultimately encourage growth of the Duke AC-PNP program and perhaps benefit our students as graduates as well by strengthening a potential career site.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The ratings above must be considered within the context of this candidate expecting to receive a PhD in May 2010.  She has a defined area of research interest that has been consistent across several years and projects.  She has some experience with classroom and clinical teaching of adult health as part of her academic studies that included various aspects of adult health in acute care settings; it is notable that she had committed mentors who maximized this experience.  It is not clear that she has any formal preparation in education principles and methods.  I was impressed with the questions Ms. Dekker posed and her commitment to a faculty role with teaching and research aspects is evident.  As a new assistant professor, she would require support to evolve into the faculty role and I believe she would be successful.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Although I think Rebecca could teach in the program, and would do a good job, I don&apos;t think her coming would help the ABSN program with our faculty shortage.  Her focus as a tenured faculty would be more on her research than on the teaching, which is fine except that we are in great need of teachers!!! We took this second cohort with the commitment to have additional faculty to help carry the load and so this hire would not help in that way at all.  The adult health position, above the others, covers all four semesters of the program, with Foundations and Adult health running year round so we need faculty who can and want to teach.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Very poised, clearly well-prepared and has what seems to be a lot of productivity for where she is in her career. I like that she is younger….will be a perfect role model for the ABSN students, as many of them desire to go on for practice and research doctorates. I think it very wise that we bring on faculty who are younger….as someone needs to be concerned that we are going to look around and all the 50+ age faculty are going to exit at the same time?  This candidate presents herself in a very confident manner…and I am expecting will be very good, very student-centered in her teaching style.   That said, here is my concern. This candidate, like the previous 4 who have interviewed now have a distinct &quot;pattern&quot; to the interview…when ask &quot;why Duke?&quot; they all say the same thing….&quot;ability to do or get back to my research.&quot; Nothing wrong with research at a research intensive university….but hey, have they not read the job description??? Or are they getting guided into another position after they enter our doors? If so, let us know, so those of us who think we are getting a colleague to help us teach in the ABSN program can come to understand that our load is not going to be lightened at all. The job (I thought) Dr. Dekker is interviewing for is TEACHING and I hope teaching full-time? Because those of us who are teaching full-time and are on the clinical track and &quot;in the trenches&quot; with this second cohort are going to look around and find the faculty that were hired (Caines for one) are going to be doing research (because if they declare they are on the tenure track they get a diminished teaching load) and we are going to be holding this BIG teaching responsibility, by ourselves (Ward was a definite exception…clearly she is going to teach). So, instead of hiring 5 new faculty, we may only net 2.5…..it is going to look like we have all this new faculty…but that will not be the case.   I am thinking that something is occuring as they enter the interview process that has them &quot;shift&quot; their focus from the job description and place it on their research? This has now happened too many times to be just a &quot;fluke?&quot; I understand the importance of reseach….but tuition dollars also pay the bills here…and those of us &quot;carrying&quot; this load, what some helpers! I am still a bit stunned that Karen Caines has demonstrated already her intent to get back to her research and &quot;get her papers out.&quot; Far more was said about research in her recent visit, than her concern for the summer courses. I for one, on the &quot;quasi-clinical track&quot; am promoted on writing papers, too. But who can get to it?  Who can get to innovation….because it is looking like we are not hiring &quot;teaching colleagues&quot; but rather researchers who will occassionally teach a course.   I think this woman would be perfect for Duke. Just not in the ABSN Program. She wants to do research. We need teaching faculty.</qualitative>

<qualitative>While I think she may be weak in the educational/teaching aspect, I think she has a lot of potential to excel given the resources we have with the IEE. Due to time constraints, I was not able to ask more questions about her teaching experiences and expectations. On the research side, I think she is a strong candidate; she has had strong mentors at KY (Moser and Lennie), has worked on a number of funded projects, has been a RA, and her beginning publication record is good. Grantsmanship is hard to evaluate: I am surprised that she has not garnered NIH funding of any kind, given her mentors and the type of research she&apos;s doing. I think her research fits well with various areas at DUSON, most particularly with the DTNI and Heart Care Center connections (and maybe even Aging Center). Overall, I think she has a lot of potential, given some mentoring and support.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I had a very enjoyable conversation with Dr. Peace.  I find her to be an enthusiastic, bright individual with very strong interests in informatics.  Her mentors are Dr. Patti Brennan and, secondary, Dr. Mark Musen -  two well-respected leaders in the field of informatics.  She has strong interests in nursing informatics, particularly relating to ontologies and in support of consumers. She is interested in genetics, decision support, and family health history.  I think these areas would fit in and contribute to work at Duke.  I am impressed with her productivity in 2009.  First author on 3 publications in referred journals plus two other publications in press as 1st author; 3 presentations; and two articles in process.  Although she has limited experience in writing grants, she does have the one award and states she has work with Dr. Brennan in grant writing. She is interested in teaching and research.  I think Dr. Peace has excellent potential.  I do think she needs to understand what she wants to do and what in what areas she wants to focus.  She has general understanding of many areas, but she really needs to identify what areas she wishes to “own” at Duke.  She needs to think in more specific terms. I think she will profit from good mentoring.   I would enjoy working with Dr. Peace.  I pushed her on several topics and she responded well.  I am positive and enthusiastic in my recommendation in support of hiring Dr. Peace.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think Dr. Peace did an adequate job of presenting her work. During a meeting with her, she mentioned that she felt more comfortable interacting with student through the online methods of teaching than in face-to-face. This left me puzzled and made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Her research seems to be in the area of genetics (Fragile X) syndrome. She seems particularly interested in relationshisp between non-biological kin. I think this research adds to DUSON expertise in genetics. It is not clear to me whether this theme would be competitive for grant funding. I wanted to learn more about how she would lead/create information systems that could be implemented in practice and how she would involve students in her research. Overall, a pleasant person.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I am in the middle of the road regarding whether or not to recruit Dr. Peace.  My decision would be influenced by how well she fits with SON programs and projects and how she compares to other candidates.  Reasonable background and training.  PhD mentor Patti Brennen is well respected in the Biomedical Informatics field.  Average scholary activity to date.  Concern that research interests may not be cutting edge which could make future funding a challenge.  Dr. Peace had some ideas of where she might pursue funding, but no clear plan on specific pathway for future grants.  I was not available to attend her research presentation so I cannot comment on her skill set in this area.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Candidate looks great on paper -- she has trained with or worked with outstanding teams. But her research presentation was disappointing..much too focused on conceptual issues, and not enough on data.  When she presented findings from her post-doctoral research, the data were difficult to follow, and she didn&apos;t handle questions particularly well.  Her areas of research are very important and very interesting, yet she didn&apos;t convey the idea that she could lead a scientific investigation, nor that she had good command of the methods she had used.  During interpersonal interactions, she seemed almost over-eager to please those she was with, rather than truly understanding what a related discipline might be about, and how she might contribute.  She also seems to have a fairly naïve view of how she would be engaged in teaching.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Solid candidate, but did not have the opportunity to learn about her specific methods or empirical approach to analysis, as well as concrete outcomes of each of her studies presented---i.e., &quot;What we learned from this study was….which then led to….&quot;
I believe that this is the result of her presentation being too vague without the concrete info that I sought, plus I didn&apos;t have any one-on-one time with her.  If others felt she has strong empirical analytical skills, and has conducted much of her own analyses as would be expected of a post-doc, then I would be in favor of recruiting her.  Otherwise, I would want to have another conversation with her----she has had outstanding mentors and is clearly a rising star in an interdisciplinary field of scholarship germaine to Nursing Research.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Bell&apos;s research is very exciting and in this time of healthcare reform, the work on optimality is quite relevant. In the field of obstetrics/maternity this is a very &quot;hot&quot; topic as it ties so closely to costs of birth in the U.S. and potential cost savings. I suspect it is only going to get more attention as healthcare economics becomes more important…and for that reason I would imagine that she will have several funding avenues available to her.  I suspect that there are many areas of collaboration in which she could make linkeges both on the Duke campus as well as across the U.S. Dr. Lippert at Duke was quite excited about the opportunities Dr. Bell would open up for Duke. I also recognize that having a PhD in maternity would position DUSON to attract PhD &amp; DNP students that want to pursue projects and research in the maternity field….this would indeed expand our capacities…an expansion I would welcome.  I do not question the value of her mentors nor her research abilities. However, she is not a match on many other levels (per the posted job description) for this position. While she was very upfront with her intentions, she clearly stated that she will be commuting back and forth with her husband in Chicago (who has 4 years before retirement). They will share this task. While that is really not the primary concern her lack of understanding about the time and effort it will take to both establish her research plan, secure funding and LEARN TO TEACH is totally unrealistic. Unlike Karen Caines who will also be on the tenure track, this woman has NO TEACHING experience (by her own self-assessment). Karen Caines, does. While Dr. Bell is &quot;very willing to learn…and is a blank slate, so you will not have to undo old/bad habits, I have no classroom experience with a full semester course.&quot; She went on to add that she has no curriculum experience, no experience in the area of evaluating the clinical performance of pre-liscensure students (any students for that matter) and while she had an &quot;opportunity to take a 3 course sequence on teaching/learning in her PhD program, she did not take it.&quot; So, she also lacks any kind of a theoritical framework for teaching/learning. While her midwifery experience is good, though not recent, she did not seem to understand that this experience as an advanced practice nurse will not be the place from which she can teach to generalist, pre-liscensure nursing students. It is important to note that it has been 14 years since her in-patient experience in an acute care setting.   Her coming with no teaching experience against the backdrop of the very changed  &quot;landscape&quot; of the ABSN Program (2 cohorts) and a curriculum change pending,  prohibits the intense mentoring, guiding and teaching that this woman needs even to be up to &quot;minimum&quot; speed in this program. She will have to assume her load for both the course as well as the intense planning year that is ahead for us as the ABSN curriculum transforms to the new AACN Essentials. She made a couple of concerning comments:
1. What do you do with that many students in a lecture room?
2. Do you have graduate students to &quot;help out?&quot; (* It was explained to her that she would be part of the &quot;help&quot; and that we believe our students pay for and deserve not graduate students but full faculty). 
3. I would not have to take them into the clinical setting, would I? ***This was the most concerning. I do not believe she has the skills to evaluate the learning needs of pre-liscensure students. 
If her presentation at noon was any indication of her possible style in the classroom with students, then she would have considerable work to master to be able to engage our highly challenging students in the classroom. Her presentation was flat, cold, it lacked any &quot;spark&quot; about her topic…and she demonstrated no enthusiasm for her own work. Now one might argue that she was nervous and certainly in the company of DHD she probably was more nervous….but she just never &quot;warmed up&quot; or demonstrated much excitement all day. I really do think by the end of the day, she was more enthusiastic about DUSON, though she shared in the morning that &quot;Duke was not on her radar, as she has focused her efforts on the top 5 ranked schools.&quot; It was through her research (post-doc) mentor at Illinois and the relationship with DHD that she considered Duke. That after getting here, she was very surprised by the &quot;internal support for research and all that is here, including the incredible opportunity to collaborat with DHD.&quot; Building on that, there were many questions about what her teaching load might look like and &quot;how she could buy her time out of teaching with grant funding.&quot; That said combined with her self-admitted deficits of even basic teaching principals and skills, I cannot support her hire for the ABSN position</qualitative>

I discussed with her the challenges of teaching ABSN students and she seemed not to get why a straight powerpoint might not be an effective teaching method..  She only wants tenure track; didn’t even consider Duke because it was not one of the top 4-5 schools but when UIC decreased their contributions to the retirement plans her mentor said to also look elsewhere so she came down some notches to look at Duke (well wasn&apos;t that a slap in the face to us!); very concerned about our retirement plans and whether they were solid.  Her husband is a professor in Chicago and cannot retire for 4 years so she wants to be in Chicago Friday through Sunday fly here on Monday and stay until Thurs eve.

<qualitative>Dr. Wu&apos;s strengths lie in the following areas:  (1) her interprofessional program of research that is focused on global health and aging, (2) her demonstrated ability to develop and sustain a rich network of collaborators from a variety of top-tier academic centers to engage in global health research, (3) her work ethic and interpersonal style, which is evidenced by her high level of productivity.
Ten years from her doctoral training in an interdisciplinary gerontology program, she has over published over 50 peer-reviewed publications, and has served as first author on approximately half.  She has received R-level funding from a variety of institutes within the NIH, including the Fogarty Center, the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute for Dental and Cranio-facial disorders, and has a number of proposals under review.  The focus of her research is on the effects of cognitive impairment and oral health.  In this work, she has partnered with other, well-recognized investigators at Duke, and has successfully obtained funding for and executed international studies in this area.  She is poised to become one of the leading scientists in global health and aging.  Importantly, her work has direct implications for nursing practice, emphasizing, as it does, the impact of cognitive impairment on oral health, which, in turn, has been linked with a variety of important health outcomes. Her proven track record in establishing collaborative research that is focused on important health problems for which health disparities exist, and for which nursing can make important contributions  makes her an ideal candidate to provide senior research leadership to our global health mission.</qualitative>

She recognizes that such collaboration is a two-way street, and that the US (and nursing) can learn from China also. She has developed ties locally and internationally. She has good connections with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and is doing considerable work in the largely unexplored area of dental health in the elderly. She is opening up this field, in addition to her concern with health care provision to the elderly. She has a substantial publication record, has collaborated with others, and clearly more than pulls her own weight.  Her interests align well with OGACHI, she would be an outstanding addition.   Disclaimer: I am included, in a very minor consulting capacity, on a subcontract that she has with Brenda Plassman on one of her grants. I have read the grant. It was beautifully written, and brought out matters of real interest.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Wu is an engaging and enthusiastic faculty member who has numerous talents related to priority needs within DUSON including global health, gerontology (with a dentail focus as well that is unique), cultural competence, interprofessional practice and education, etc.  I believe she would be a good fit from a research collaboration perspective as well as a valuable addition to our teaching faculty.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Wu would significantly further the School&apos;s strategic mission in relation to Global Health Research, especially in relation to gero-focused global health nursing.  Her vision, in the context of a clear capacity to actualize that vision, ranges from large-scale, NIH-funded global health aging research, to innovative nursing practice and educational models of improving gero nursing care in China, which would truly ensure that DUSON is not just the campus leader in such efforts, but a global leader in this arena.  Importantly, Dr. Wu has an NIH-funded program of intervention-focused research in oral healthcare and oral healthcare disparities, which would address a research and teaching gap that currently exists in DUSON.  I believe recruiting Dr. Wu is absolutely essential to furthering the School&apos;s mission and growing the global impact of DUSON.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I thought that she would be a GREAT addition to the Nursing School Faculty.  She is an excellent, productive investigator with an outstanding record of grant receipt.  She has done excellent work with international collaborators and has excellent international connections.  Her aging interests would make her a natural fit at the interface of Global Health and Gerontology for the Nursing School.  I would be very enthusiastic about her hiring.  Re:  experience/ability to participate/lead school in accreditation process: not sure what this takes, she would certainly add ot the research credibility; re: understanding of curriculum issues across ABSN, MSN, DNP, and PhD programs:  I don’t think she&apos;s had the opportunity to do so.  I&apos;m sure she can asssess this overtime.  She certainly understands the Global issues; re:  vision/innovation for leading curriculym in to the future:  she would be very strong in developing Global research programs and establishing connections in other countries-especially Asia; re:  likelihood of securing training/research grant funding for innovative nursing ed:  most likely related to research training and Global Research.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I thought Dr. Wu was a great candidate and a perfect match with the research position being advertised. I also felt she would have teaching skills that many clinicians might not have in the area of global health and health policy, especially as relates to her work in Shanghai. Her vita was impressive in terms of external funding and in terms of research publication history, and she has extensive political and academic networks of colleagues in China, which would be important for the position being filled.  I personally would like to Bei join Duke because I would like to collaborate with her. We discussed several areas in which that might be possible and we have a number of overlapping interests.   I have known Bei for several years thru GSA and thru my post-doctoral fellow who also is Chinese. My sense is that she would be an excellent colleague.  In short, she is an impressive recruit and one who would certainly have a substantial impact on the Duke Faculty.</qualitative>

Marilyn is well known and recognized for her outstanding academic, research and clinical management in pediatric hematology-oncology.  She is also highly respected in the advanced practice nursing world.  She is well known (and liked!) by leading academic physicians and nurses, and would be a tremendous asset to DUSON.  My personal opinion is that Marilyn could play an integral role in helping us bridge the academic and clinical worlds for our DNP students at Duke, and in helping Duke establish a vision and opportunities for employment for our DNP graduates.  In short, we are crazy if we don&apos;t aggressively pursue her and bring her to Duke!!!!</qualitative>

When asked about past teaching strategies, he stated that he used &quot;very traditional&quot; methodologies which is not congruent with DUSON vision.  The ABSN program needs a 100% mental health faculty member.  If he is selected, the school will need to recruit another 50% unfilled by his &quot;buyout&quot; as a new tenure track candidate.  Finally during the interview, he got progressively more nervous which resulted in profound fidgeting and needing to ask for interview questions to be repeated several times.

<qualitative>Of the applicants (now 3) that we have interviewed I believe this candidate to be the strongest. Why: 1) he has an interpersonal style + ability to speak from both clinical practice and the evidence that will be well received by ABSN students, his interpersonal style will be a great balance in this course and within the faculty group, 2)he is here, well connected, well-mentored to services and people on this campus…which in short means that he can &quot;hit the ground running,&quot; 3) his research is established and well-received which in my mind means time will not be wasted in establishing connections and laying a foundation for his research (he has that already)…which translates to time he can spend developing his teaching. Of the candidates we have interviewed for this position I believe he will be the best balance for the course he will be teaching…which is under review and redesign. He has taught before, clearly is comfortable in both large and small group settings and I think of the three candidates can make the best contribution to the ABSN program. He is strong, solid and will not be swept away by the personalities and agendas in the ABSN program. I see him coming in and making a contribution in a course that has never been right and is still plagued with issues. Perhaps the addition of another point of view….one that is grounded in contemporary clinical practice and new teaching ideas will bring the enthusiasm for mental health nursing that ABSN students need to see. They come to this program interested in the topic and because of  their weak clinical and classroom experience they exit not wanting to go anywhere near the clinical area. Mark&apos;s enthusiasm and positive role modeling will do much to bolster this course and establish a strong footing within the ABSN curriculum. I stronly support his appointment and feel of the three candidates that he is unquestionably the best one for the job. As an aside, it will be a positive statement that &quot;one of our own&quot; doctoral candidates is on faculty here. This will be a very positive factor for those ABSN students who are examining the possiblity of doctoral work for their own careers. On another note, I suspect that that he will meet with resistance among some of the ABSN faculty…which is unfortunate, but true. I hope the search committee can look beyond the &quot;agendas&quot; of some of the faculty and choose the candidate that can provide us the best foundation for the students and the program. I believe that person to be Mark Toles.</qualitative>

Although she has experience as a lecturer at the Master&apos;s level her professional presentations have a narrow focus as well. Although she has many years of primary care experience, it seems as though she has stepped away from clinical practice in recent years. I am not certain that she would be able to be flexible in her ability to provide a broad enough clinical framework for our graduate students.

He brings clinical expertise, a national perspective and focus related to the development and improvement of the advanced practice role. Mike has demonstrated his ability to teach through guest lecturer and seminar leader assignments in the master&apos;s program.  His presentation yesterday was another demonstration of his ability to teach and the high level of his scholarship.   The type of positive intellectual discussion that was stimulated among the faculty was extraodinary.  A level of inquiry discussion occurred amongst faculty and with Mike that I had not seen in the school for a long time.  He is also well able to articulate the uniqueness of both the advanced practice role and DNP role to other nurses, medicine and various stakeholders.   Mike would be an exceptional asset to the school and should be recruited immediately.</qualitative>

<qualitative>This was an outstanding and thoughful presentation. It was theoritical, deep and very thought provoking. Clearly Michael has a capacity that I had not ability (prior to this presentation) to know. I think he would be a welcome additon to the faculty and would provide a point-of-view that I do not see currently represented in this faculty…that of the role of theory in the development of advanced nurse practitioners. Unfortunately, it seems we reserve this level of inquiry for our doctoral students…when in reality it needs to be introduced at all levels (in differing ways) to our students. Michael clearly has a broad point-of-view and because of his work with CCNE he has an ability to provide visibility for DUSON that few of the faculty here can do. But besides his national reputation, I believe his background, clinical practice and deep passions for advanced practice are needed for our students.   While I cannot comment on his ability to secure funding….he is needed on this faculty for he brings a unique point of view…..and I could see him in time, were the opportunity to ever present for him to lead either the master&apos;s curriculum modifications or lead the program in an administrative position. He has a wonderful personality, quick wit and easy and comfortable presentation style. Clearly he would and does represent the school well. I can&apos;t imagine that  he would not be a welcome addition to the faculty. I strongly support his application.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Mark is not an appropriate candidate for the FNP position. A review of his CV does not show evidence of any advanced practice or teaching experience in (FNP) primary care. There are two years as APRN but the description of that position is not elaborated upon. Moreover, at Duke we need a person or persons for FNP who know advance practice primary care from professional practice at the community level which is where all of our clinical practicums are located. Mark has not had this experience. Further, we need faculty who can hit the ground ready to teach, mentor, and serve as a role model in primary care. Mark&apos;s educational background show a master&apos;s as FNP, however, his background and experience are not in primary care community practice but psych mental health. Further, Duke needs a faculty member who has national and state certification as an advanced practice nurse. Mark graduated 11 years ago with his APRN master&apos;s; however, is not a good represntation of the caliber of faculty we have in our FNP program. Prior to Mark&apos;s candidacy, for over the past 10 years we have interview only FNPs who were nationally certified in their advanced practice specialty, had current or prior state licensure or approval as FNP, and who had solid exemplary primary care practice.   Mark&apos;s  background may be congruent with the requirements of the ABSN program needs for psych/mental health. Further, his shows evidence of current and future contributions at a faculty level in the mental health area..</qualitative>

<qualitative>I had one-one approximately 30 minutes with the candidate. I think Ms. Gill overstated, or embellished her faculty connection at UNC-Charlotte. She places this at the top of her employment list. My assessment is that she goes in to provide a lecture on occasion (not a regular faculty lecturer position at UNC-Charlotte).  I was quite concerned when I mentioned that I know her Dean at UNC-Charlotte, and after three tries she could not state the correct name for the Dean.  She had no idea and could not articulate anything about the Dean. She has not had adequate faculty experience for what we need for the FNP program. We need a FNP who has mastery of his or her primary care practice and who can hit the ground in full gear and comfort, has past teaching experience as member of a faculty, has mastered advising, and mentoring students, and role modeling in practice. She is not a member of any NP professional organizations which was surprising since she listed that she had received the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners State Award for Excellence, she did not list it by the proper title, but I think this is what she meant. Her CV also contains several misspellings and editing errors, including &apos;appealant&apos; (correct spelling should be appellant); surprising since she presented that much of her work deals with evidence in the court system. She has never had membership in any nursing or advance practice nursing organization at the local, state, or national level. This is very surprising and not a good sign for how she would serve as a role model for Duke FNP students.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I highly recommend Michael Scott (Mike) without reservation for one of the two positions under  recruitment for our FNP program. He has been the only candidate for the FNP positions to meet all of the criteria. Per the  position announcement:  A.  The well qualified candidate will be certified as a family nurse practitioner and eligible for licensure as an advanced practice nurse in North Carolina.  B.  Two to three years experience teaching at the graduate level and  C.  Experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations is desirable.    
Mike is the only candidate who has interviewed to meet/master these expectations. Our FNP program has a history of attracting one of the largest student enrollments in the school for more than a decade. That trend is ever increasing. Our school needs faculty for these positions who are a good fit for DUSON who can readily fulfill faculy teaching, mentoring, and committee roles, plus when hired able to land on one&apos;s feet &apos;running and ready&apos; as our FNP enrollment is burgeoning.  I met Mike in 2005 during the time he directed his large private practice in Clemson where he was responsible for the staffing, finances, and full management of a private model outpatient primary care facility. He has years of national FNP certification and board of nursing approval/licensure to practice. He brings a level of clinical practice and practice management experience in the private sector that we do not have among FNPs in North Carolina. He will be an excellent resource for our FNP students who seek to operate a primary care practice in the future that has a viable finance model and collaboratively (among with other community practice owners) that can address primary health issues for a large and diverse population.   Mike is a master clinician and he has a  record of clinical practice leadership and excellence as evidenced by awards in this area: American Academy of Nurse Practitioners State Award for Excellence - only one or two NPs receive this award in N.C. each year. Mike was one of two honored from N.C. in 2010, and only the second DUSON faculty to ever receive this national award while at Duke. Mike has preceptoring/mentoring experience in three university FNP settings: Emory, Clemson, and Duke.  He can motivate students as I observed (in clinical site visits) with DUSON FNP students he preceptored. He took on difficulty students for us and brought their clinical skills to and in some instances above minimum expectations.  Michael is the only candidate among those presented to faculty thus far for interview who has had full faculty  experience. He taught NP courses across the primary care clinical spectrum at Emory, and delivered invited NP clinical lectures at Clemson and Duke. While his interview presentation was an example of the scholarship he could provide to students in our DNP program, Mike also has knowledgeable and engaging delivery for advance practice clinical lectures as evidenced during his faculty presentationduring his 2005 DUSON interview, and more recently as guest faculty for DUSON clinical lectures.  Mike&apos;s national and state contributions would provide additional leadership presence in the academy among our faculty.  He has a history of contributions to clinical nursing societies (i.e. American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, Georgia NP Council, and the Georgia Nurses Association). His knowledge of these organizations  will be a plus in mentoring our FNP students for more organizational membership and leadership. Lastly, Mike&apos;s has and continues to hold prominent roles on the national CCNE Executive Board. None of our DUSON faculty has held this leadership honor. He knows FNP program standards for excellence.This could bring standards up front and center to us from a faculty peer. Moreover,  Mike&apos;s work with FNP faculty could be pivotal in getting our FNP national certification passing rates back on par where they were a few years ago.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I am concerned that he showed no understanding of a regular rank faculty member&apos;s roles and responsibilities.  I am also concerned that he took credit for work that other faculty have done; a behavior that can negatively impact the faculty community.  He teaches well, but I was unable to ascertain how much he actually contributed to the various articles.  Having both his MSN and DNP from Duke is also a concern.  I think we saw evidence that some faculty who have known him through both degrees and Bob still seem to have the faculty/student relationship.  If he wants to be faculty, I would encourage him to consider a position at another school.  Given that, he might then present as a stronger candidate in the future.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Think her teaching expertise &amp; clinical practice experience is very valuable to the Acute Care NP program.  She was obviously a good teacher from her presentation, use of case studies, sense of humor, focus on practical issues that NP students need to know.   She mentioned before her presentation that they are in process of changing MSN programs to DNP at Univ MD; supporting the Carnegie study&apos;s recommendations, she uses lots of case studies (drawn from her strong concurrent clinical practice as Acute Care NP); she has adminstrative experience of running Acute Care NP program at Univ MD, all of which  would be valuable to DUSON.  Additionally she is currently President of her STT chapter which would also be valuable to us at DUSON in trying to create a more active, vibrant STT chapter here.  Also, her research interests are very compatible w/ others at DUSON doing both geriatric and acute care nursing research.  Several things impressed me about her interest &amp; commitment to Duke even at this early point in her job search process:  as part of her presentation, she mentioned contacting John Murray at Duke Hospital to find out how Duke manages TPN, which showed to me that she had the foresight &amp; critical thinking to contact him ahead of her visit for a more meaningful presentation to us, but also indicates good networking skills; she had on a Duke Blue blouse w/ her suit; and she seemed well versed in our programs &amp; specialities offered.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Sabol has excellent experience as an ACNP and is a new doctoral graduate.  She is articulate, and clearly understands the faculty role.  She has held a full time faculty position at Maryland for a number of years, and is currently the director of their ACNP program. She also demonstrates scholarly work in publications, as a journal reviewer and so forth.  She has a HRSA grant under review.  Interpersonally I like this applicant.  At times she tended to talk to much, and would wander off topic.  She strikes me as hard working and caring.  Her presentation was incredibly disappointing.  Even though she had recently completed her dissertation research (and it appears such is going to be published in a good journal) she selected to present on how she would teach ACNP students to calculate TNP mixture and dose.  This was a how to lecture.  It did not even include critical decision making -- such as the risks and benefits of TPN -- how to make the decision of beginning TPN, how to decide to end TPN, how to prepare patients and families etc.  There was no hint of using an evidence base in decision making -- it wasn&apos;t even mentioned. Variation in practice was brushed off as this is how it is -- so you need to learn the formula for different hospitals (true but not inspiring).   It was straight formulaic.  And as such it was pretty good --at the end one knew the components of TPN, how to calculate calories from each, and set the delivery rate. But to be honest -- I could give that lecture -- and I am not an ACNP -- and haven&apos;t practiced clinically in a long time.   To her credit -- she did her homework for this presentation -- she contacted the doctor at Duke who oversees TPN and throughout her talk referenced what we do at Duke.  She is clearly interested in Duke.  But I am left wondering if she is simply a concrete thinker -- coming to a school that values conceptual thinking, leadership and evidence based practice?  Can she build our program?  Will she be able to maintain the clinical sites we have and develop others?  I would need additional data before considering her for a faculty position.  I am fairly certain my thinking will be contrary to most of the evaluations you get.  Nevertheless, I hope that my comments are considered as we think of the future of our ACNP program.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Valerie&apos;s experience as a faculty member at a large SON would make her an asset to our school.  Her strengths lie not only in her ability to teach and manage large numbers of students but the value she places on academic and clinical performance.  Valerie&apos;s experience with massive curricular revision across programs would be an asset to us as we go through a similar process.  Her resesarch focus on anemia and mobility in the older adult transcends and expands on a solid framework of translational rsesarch already taking place at DUSON.  We definitely should hire this candidate.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Bob is a known entity having taught for us for almost a decade; he developed over 10 clinical sites, monitors students in clinical sites, maintains the lead NP role in the neuro ICU and brings new content inot the program.  Our graduates work in the Duke ICU. What is is not familar to Bob are faculty advising  and committee work ..an easy learn. I have talked with him about his plans for the ACNP program and he admits it has floundered without strong leadership over the past 10 years and he was able to articlute his plans for the program.  As we know he ran the program when Talbert was here.  He is also under consideration for the director of the ACNP program at UNC;  my concerns are that we would lose clinical placments and lecturers initially unitl the new person we hire ( if not Bob)  gets up to spped and develops relationships. We have two candiates; if both are good is there room for 2 faculty hires in this program?</qualitative>

<qualitative>I have known Dr. Blessing for many years.  One thing that was disturbing to me was that his cv did not reflect many contributions that I know he has made to the SON and to the profession.  For example, for years he has been the contract faculty member teaching the three acute care NP courses.  Uusally his name was not listed as the faculty member (a regular rank faculty member was listed) but he in fact taught the courses.  I also know that he has developed many of our clinical sites for the ACNP program, many of these sites are staffed (the preceptors) by our own graduates who have strong professional ties to Dr. Blessing.  Finally, I know that he consults with major tertiary hospitals across the country (I believe he is off to Hopkins this week) related to practice models for ACNPs.  The reason why these accomplishments aren&apos;t evident in his cv, is related to the one key area where he will need help.  Dr. Blessing needs to be mentored in learning the faculty role (and in regard to his cv -- what faculty document).  He has taught as a contract faculty member for years, but he has never been mentored or held a regular rank faculty position.  He has many strengths.  He is recognized as an outstanding acute care NP, and a leader.  He has expertise in models of care.  He has excellent ideas regarding how to build the ACNP program, and sufficient professional contacts to develop and add the needed clinical sites.  He is a good teacher.   He is well respected in our health system.  He has an opportunity to do international work in Germany -- and has made progress in moving this forward.  He has consistently advanced his education, and is committed to learning.  Some may weigh in negatively about his lack of &quot;faculty role&quot; understanding since he has taught for us.  I would simply say -- his only role was as a contract faculty member to teach courses -- and he did that well.  He does need to learn the faculty role.  I would hire Dr. Blessing.</qualitative>

Although, he has previously held significant  leadership positions, he reports feeling comfortable with the idea of  being a part of an Informatics faculty team here.  It appears that he could readily fill some of the teaching gaps that presently exist in the Nsg Informatics Specialty.

<qualitative>  This candidate has excellent clinical and teaching experience.  She also has great experience running research studies for medical/pharma/device trials.  Her strong contacts for research sites, qualitative research colleagues, and years of experience teaching a variety of courses at UNC is obvious.  I feel, for her sake in moving her research forward, that staying in the UNC environment (where she knows the courses, has lectures prepared, &amp; has qualitative research experts available) would make it easier for her to carve out time for grant writing and publications as she goes forward with obtaining funding for this program of research.  Although the candidate&apos;s doctoral research is very interesting and cutting edge, it is unclear to me how these findings will lead to an intervention study, so I am concered about her ability to obtain funding for this program of research as she moves forward.  It is unclear how easy/difficult it will be for her to obtain her next round of funding based on the findings she presented from her dissertation.  It will be very challenging for this candidate to juggle teaching new courses full time at DUSON, generating multiple publications from her dissertation work, and writing for grants. I think I would advise this candidate to write for post doc funding or a K grant to buy her time to develop her program of research before starting a full time faculty position.
As for how she can contribute to DUSON faculty needs, she could easily teach the cardiac content of N 210, N330, &amp; N332.  But she has no experience in teaching in online programs.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Leslie started our conversation by saying &quot;I hear you have some &quot;snipers&quot; in your pharm class.&quot;  This reference was referring to some problematic behavior in the classroom brought to her attention by the colleague she recommended to teach UG pharm for us.  During the interview she never stopped talking and frequently interrupted me when I was trying to ask a question.  I do not believe she will represent the ABSN program and DUSON in the best possible light within Duke and externally.  Finall, DUSON seems to be her default.  She is only interested in because UNC is not hiring.  She doesn&apos;t want to commute to ECU and cannot relocate due to family.  Statements about &quot;I&apos;m surprsied to find your focus on quality, innovation&quot;, &quot;I had no idea about your growth&quot; shows she did not do her homework.  If she is a tenure track candidate, this is not helpful to the ABSN program unless the Dean authorizes hiring another 50% adulty faculty.</qualitative>

In the 30 minutes there were 3-4 questions from us and she never really answered any of them; she had flight of ideas ;drifting off to stranges places in her conversation; mentioning people we had no idea who they were or how they fit into anything. I asked a straightforward question of would she be teaching across programs- she talked and talked and never really answered my question.

<qualitative>Personal interaction with this candidate brought up some significant questions about her ability to work collaboratively, she monopolized conversation, was very self-focused (way beyond what is expected of a typical faculty candidate), was rude at times with those meeting with her (cutting people off, interupting, etc), frequently danced around questions without providing answers despite speaking on (and off) topic for very extended periods of time. She drew inappropriate attention to her self during her presentation by making side comments that were not really professional or appropriate for a faculty candidate. In response to the &quot;why Duke&quot; question she, in so many words, said &quot;I need a job, Carolina is not hiring, I don&apos;t want to move so I thought I would come &apos;check you out&quot; and I am really kind of surprised by what I see, you all have some things going on over here&quot; almost suggesting that she expected a little backwater school. My biggest concern is that a person should be on their best behavior during a job interview, which makes me wonder exactly where she would go from this point. If she is hired I am guessing she will be a difficult person to work with.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I have known Leslie for a number of years, although my academic relationship with her has not been close.  Nonetheless, I know she has a reputation as an excellent clinican and excellent teacher.  Her work history includes a variety of experiences including working as a research nurse in  a number of significant clinical trials. During her interview at Duke she expressed an interest in becoming an excellent researcher and has pursued her PhD as a step in achieving this goal.  Her presentation was reasonable and she ably discussed her doctoral work. However, given her topic and qualitative methodology, future funding may be an issue. ORA would need to work with her in structuring future research so that she might obtain funding that will help her further research in her area of interest.  Like many doctoral students she is tied to the work of her advisor, which may not be the most fertile path for her to follow in her future work.  
During her interviews with the APT Committee she was overly talkative -- and at times talked for long periods without directly answering questions. This was distracting, and may be related to the nervousness of interviewing. I think she possesses qualities we are seeking in a faculty member.  Her role in the ABSN program needs to be clarified -- I believe she could bring expertise to the ABSN program both in adult health and in basic courses such as pharmacology.  She also could teach in NP majors in the MSN program, and over time could teach in the graduate program.  She is definite in her desire to focus on research and seeks an appointment in the tenure track.    I would continue to pursue her as a candidate.  She is bright, a very hard worker, has a wealth of experience and is on the verge of successfully defending her dissertation.  She would most likely be a good addition to our faculty.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I have difficulty in recommending this faculty candidate because she didn&apos;t appear to really want a position at Duke.  Her reasoning for Why Duke was that they were not hiring at UNC and she didn&apos;t want to move out of state of North Carolina.  In addition, she seemed to have difficulty answering direct questions concisely and seemed to be pressured in her speech.  Several times she interupted the interviewer to prevent the asking of questions so she could continue to expound on her achievements. her entire interview appeared to be about who she knows rather than what she knows.  During her presentation, I would have also expected more informtion related to her current scholarship. She spent the majority of the lecture discussing the background and methodology for her study.  I realize she has yet to defend her dissertation but she did not  report preliminary findings and only provided minimal information suggesting how she came to view identity and role responsibilities  as playing a predominent role in pre hospital delay.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think Leslie has the qualities we need in a faculty member here in regards to her teaching skills, knowledge of students and their issues, curricular needs.  It is difficult to gauge her ability to actively participate as a team member in our faculty because she was very verbose in the Adult Health interview session we had.  In one hour, we were only able to ask 4 questions and I don&apos;t feel satisfied Leslie adequately answered those 4 questions.  I think some of that could be from nerves, but she interupted people and seemed to drop names and make sly comments in the midst of attempting to answer our questions.  It was quite frustrating.  I think it is a tough situation because we need help in the program badly in adult health.  To date, she is the best, most experienced faculty we have had interview.  I wish that she would have heeded the advise I heard she got in the morning to talk less and listen more. She definitely did not do that.</qualitative>

Does he understand our discipline well enough to mentor doctoral students - both research and practice?  What will he contribute other than teaching two informatics courses. Will he work well with Drs Johnson and Peace.

<qualitative>While Ms. Davis certainly has a wealth of experience. After hearing &quot;non-stop&quot; from Ms. Davis all the things she has done, the awards she has won for teaching and the 99+ names she dropped during a group interview and her presentation I have come to the conclusion that she is not a good fit for this position at DUSON. I know there will be many (esp. those that know her from another time in her career) that will not see or will over look the behaviors she demonstrated during her interview time here. However, I have no history with this candidate. I found her behavior to be both bizarre and rude. She never and I do mean NEVER stopped talking about herself in the interview. Were she a patient in my clinic, I would have recorded &quot;manic episode&quot; to characterize her behavior in this interview. At first I thought it was nerves. Upon further reflection, I do not think it was nerves. I believe it to be representative of her  personality combined with unsophistication. To say flat out in an interview when ask, &quot;Why Duke?&quot; She stated, &quot;The money, it is a position, I would not have to leave the Triange (and oh, how many times she stated she did not want to leave the Triangle) and with the cuts happening at UNC I could get a better job here…and why, I had no idea what you all were doing over here till I got the packet…and with your pretty new building, and the people I know and that woman who helps you with your teaching, I could now consider it.&quot;  I timed her, it took 18 minutes with hardly a breath to say this, and much more! This kind of behavior cannot be overlooked…it is a &quot;sign&quot; of something else. That she is so unsophisticated to have said this….but more importantly that she never inquired about our students, what it like to be a faculty member here, etc. says more of her motivations.  But the worst of it, was when one of the faculy members attempted to ask her question, she put her hand up to silence our collegue so that she could pick up on one of her flight of ideas from a previous answer. This woman never answered a question straight, she deomstrated random flights of thought, circular thinking and SHE NEVER SHUT UP! She talked non-stop. I do not believe she would be a good advisor for our students, nor would she be a good teaching colleague. Ms. Davis she did not represent the actions of a person that I would think of as educated and I would would be embarassed to have her represent us…one might never know when she would start on a tanget of &quot;Look at me, Leslie, how great I am!.&quot;  I can&apos;t imagine her in a classroom nor being a team teacher.

<qualitative>I was glad I had the time with Ms. Davis on Thursday morning after hearing her presentation. I was mesmerized with her clinical experience and expertise. There is no question that she is a skilled and respected clinician and educator. My reservations with Ms. Davis lie in her evidence for and potential for a productive career in research. In a 22 page CV there are less than a dozen references to research productivity related to her doctoral work and program. (Yes she has managed over 30 clinical trials but this is not her work.) In the last year she has secured a T32 spot (unclear why only in her last year of the program) and had recognition for her doctoral research from AANP and Sigma Theta Tau. She referenced a Jane Smith scholarship in awards but not under grants or research (not clear that exactly that was for). In fact, only Sigma Theta Tau was listed in grants which led me to believe this might have been the only one she competed for. Unlike most soon to be PhD graduates, she does not have any grant applications currently in development or under review, any dissertation or doctoral program publications under review, in press or published or any abstracts or refereed presentations submitted or completed. None in 4 years. As an almost new PhD graduate, she is not yet prepared for a tenure track position and at this point wouldn&apos;t even be competitive for a K award given her lack of productivity. It would be my recommendation that she seek out a postdoctoral position to have time to publish and secure external funding without the distraction of teaching and mentorship of ABSN students. She is so keen to be involved in a lot of different things but now post graduation needs the time to focus on her research and development of a research portfolio. Alternatively she may want to consider continuing on the clinical track.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Bob has no clear concept of the role of a faculty member outside of  lecturing or precepting. His explanations were often disjointed in his presentation and Dr. Turner ( his collaborator) jumped in several times to clarify.  In many ways, Dr. Turner&apos;s presence and answers were a distraction because of her connection to the project being presented.  Bob did not command the room.  He did not anticipate the gaps his listeners would need filled.  He demonstrated a lack of deep thought regarding several areas of the project.  On the other hand, students LOVE Bob.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I will admit to being very excited about this candidate based on my previous contacts with her over the past 1.5 years. However I was really disappointed with my 1 hour of time with her. I met her with 2 other faculty members and I believe Ms. Davis talked nonstop for 52 of 60 minutes. She repeatedly dropped names of folks I didn&apos;t know and talked about how surprised she was to find so many things going on at DUSON. I was able to ask 1 question and my colleagues were limited in their questions as well. I received a follow-up email from her that I will simply say left me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. I have no doubt that she can teach and may develop a program of research along the way. However, I believe she was ill prepared for her interview and first impressions can be lasting.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Interpersonally I really liked this candidate.  She is also providing nursing leadership at her university which has an occupational health center.  What was incredibly disappointing to me was her presentation.  She did not know her data, did not tie her interventions to existing theory, and was rather clueless regarding her statistical analysis.  This was rather shocking as her intervention was innovative, refreshing, and I think holds real promise.  In short, I&apos;m not certain that I see her as a match for our School.  She is very junior, and again interpersonally I liked her, although she was naïve.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Her focus on work environments and experience with NIOSH as a funding agency would be a nice addition to DUSON. I&apos;ve heard from her colleagues in Ohio that she is an excellent educator and mentor and she would definite benefit from a more healthy split of her time between research and teaching. It would be nice to see her more engaged in service activities but she at least shows the potential for collaboration and contribution to several relevant groups. I wouldn&apos;t have put her in an &quot;EBP&quot; category though and more like implementation and organizational science category. With an occupational health and safety  and behavior change background and a focus on implementation science I might have considered her best affiliated with the DNP program. Overall I really liked her as a person and an innovator in her teaching methods and wish I could have heard her present. Not sure if any of these thoughts are helpful to you…</qualitative>

<qualitative>She is an experienced teacher and in mentorship for program administration; she is familiar with online instruction; loves teaching; shared her syllabi with me and some innovative teaching methods she uses.  Loves the clinical setting for  her clincial studies has some grant management experience. She understands evidence based practice. Is engaging and would work well with students. She is just young in the faculty role and needs mentorship for her reserach.  In presenting her research she did not understand her data or if she did could not explain it well to us so she would need statisical consulation for her work. She has been involved at the university level on finance committees so has an understanding of the greater university workings.  Here is my comparision between the two candidates for this positon.  Tanabe likes research on instrument development has a built in team of colleagues here at Duke; is totally focused on sickle cell disease and I worry that if students capstones are not in that area she will not step up to the plate. She is less fond of teaching and does not know the content  we want her to teach nor anything about online teaching but says she can learn it so there is a learning curve and thus needs mentorship.  She would  commute for a while.  Yap loves teaching and her students and her clinical research work. Her research is congruent with what we do here in long term faculities. She would need mentoring for  research and statistics.</qualitative>

<qualitative>This candidate has extremely good technical skills, and also a good (not excellent) ability to explain concepts. I only was with him for 10 minutes, so I do not have a good feeling for his personality. He seemed a little nervous, which is natural. He was not very forthcoming while in my office in answering my own questions about his talk. Of course, during the talk he did answer questions. My gut feeling is that he would be a great resource technically - I have no good read about what he would be like to work with. I wish it was more positive.I did have a few more thoughts on the candidate yesterday.  Certainly he has wonderful technical skills. Frankly far beyond mine! In this sense it would be great to have him here. On the other hand, I was thinking about that presentation.  He should have known that the audience would not be mathematical statisticians. As such, he should have been much more explanatory.  Much of the technical details should have been omitted or if included just explained if possible. To make faculty sit through something like that is slightly disrespectful of their time. I only had about 15 minutes with him and he did not strike me as particularly eager to discuss his work with me on a one to one basis. I was sort of surprised at this. I would not recommend that we pursue him. Just wanted to clarify. Thanks!!</qualitative>

<qualitative>I do not think he would be a good fit for the school, because his presentation was not tailored for the target audience. Too many slidies with complicated Greek symbols for which only statsiticians would fall or care to follow.  This made me concerned that he would not be able to adequately adapt his teaching to the student needs in the school.  I did not get a feel that he understood that a certain portion of his time would be devoted to statistical service work for primarily small sample size projects (studies with less than 200 individuals enrolled)..  My concern is that he would come and not stay because he would be more intereted in larger projects that could support larger portion of his research time.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I attended this candidate&apos;s presentation and did not understand any of it. He is obviously a brillant statistician; however, I&apos;m not sure that he can bring the language down to collaborate with faculty or students. Because there were many faculty in the audience, I would have preferred that the candidate organized his presentation to be understood by nursing faculty rather than graduate level statisticians. I found myself wondering why this candidate is applying for a position within a nursing school- as his language, work, and presentation style is more geared towards biostatistics or epidemiology. He was a very nice person and seemed willing to get along with others. There was no mention of teaching in his presenatation.</qualitative>

<qualitative>SV is an excellent candidate.  He has a keen interest in developing his own line of discovery in statistical methods.  Since his presentation was on a new statistical approach, it was somewhat above me -- and statistics faculty in the SON can best comment on it.  He was approachable, interpersonally warm, listened carefully and is I think a thoughtful scholar.  I also think he would bring excellent analytical skills to faculty on grants. My only concern is whether or not he would be better suited in an environment where more faculty are doing statistical research.  Perhaps he could find such on the Duke campus.  I also am not certain how well he would &quot;synch&quot; with our faculty in writing grants.  He is a good candidate -- I would however rank him second to SM.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Preparation and clinical experience are not aligned with this position. Her recent expereince in the UNCW maternity course consisted of the supervision of one (1) maternity clincial group of 10 students in 2007, nothing since. She described current involvement with the undergraduate maternity course as an &quot;occasional guest lecturer&quot; on issues related to HIV. She shared that she has never taught groups as &quot;large as Duke&apos;s ABSN cohorts&quot; and has &quot;never taught maternity nursing.&quot; That in order to teach maternity content she will have to &quot;quickly take  CEU courses to get herself up to speed on maternity clinical issues.&quot; Most concerning was her description of herself during the group interview as &quot;having self-esteem issues that have followed her all her life.&quot; Her presentation style at the 1pm meeting was weak; she read slides from the monitor, never left the podium and at times could not be seen.  She is a sweet, dear and very likeable woman. Her protrayal of herself and the focus of her career would indicate that she is not at this time prepared for the challenges and rigor that would be required of her at Duke. A significant concern would be her ability to be a credible faculty member on content she does not know. Despite the research mentoring she would be able to obtain from the faculty at DUSON with expertise in HIV,  the teaching demands could exceed the capacities of this fragile woman.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr Dungan&apos;s area of interest is very specific this is both a benefit and a detriment.  On the benefit she brings genetic expertise to the school.  Her interest is in secondary data analysis of genetic information; on the negative she says she will only work with students ( DNP) who have capstones projects in cardiac genetics - this is unlikely to happen thus her wilingness to accept work outside her specific area must be explored if she is to be of real benefit to the school.  I have taught with her and she is a very very junior faculty member who frequency says incorrect things in her lectures and then has to go back the next week to change them.  She is knowledgeable in her area of research abut not able to broadly relate nursing conepts and interventions.  Her teachign areas are limited. She is a researcer and that is her foci which is a match for the position she is seeking; my expereince with her is that research is first prioirity and all else is secondary thus when we promised papers would be returned on xx day she returned hers a week later because she was working on her manuscripts- naturally this did not go over well with students.</qualitative>

<qualitative>While I think Dr. Dungan is a brilliant scientist, it has been my experience that she is quite high maintenance. She has balked at nearly every teaching assignment she&apos;s been given, and seems to have great difficulty integrating teaching and research during semesters when she has to teach. She also has an air of entitlement; she seems to think that she should be permitted to function under a different set of rules than the rest of us. I realize she will probably be able to bring grants in, and that her work is important, but I don&apos;t know if it will be worth the trouble.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I am selfishly extremely interested in Jennifer Dungan as we have 2 major opportunities to use her expertise in the DTNI…first with the new opportunities for DTMI funding, teaching, and nursing development using the GWAS genetic data, and second with the hope for a T32 genomics application in conjunction with the larger DTMI T1 group (NEI Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training Grants (T32) for Statistical Genetics and Genome Informatics.)  It would be really great to have a nurse at the table who was working together with these guys, and it would bring quite a new niche and area of unique expertise for the school.   
In addition, I really think Jennifer is an excellent educator about the whole genomics piece (background, methods and application especially) and she would be a huge asset.  thanks for the opportunity to talk with her and thanks for your hard work on the recruitment committee!</qualitative>

Almost once started to do her name dropping but caught herself.  She has taken the coaching. This however, makes me suspicious as to who is the real Leslie Davis? The first woman we saw or the second? I am sure she is clinically sound. I just can&apos;t erase the image from my mind on how she acted the first time and the things she said. To have made this much of a 360, make me think she is a good actress.  I am not convinced that this is a match. She still seems very rough around the edges. We need a &quot;home run&quot; and I am not convinced that Leslie Davis is the one. I think she needs to be a &quot;pass.&quot;</qualitative>

<qualitative>I was glad to have a second opportunity to meet with Ms. Davis. It became even more clear to me that she has not yet thought through what it is she wants to do after completing her PhD. When offered opportunities to teach in areas other than the one she applied for she responded, &quot;I will do anything I am asked to do and do it well but I may not be excited about it.&quot; So while she probably would be a good lead faculty mentor in a clinical research management track, she had little interest and mentioned wanting to get away from those experiences in her past. When asked about the direction of her research she at one time suggested she would pursue clinical research first to test her ideas; in another breath she was going to apply for implementation research awards and ten minutes later said she would be ready in one year to submit a models of care delivery grant. I do not feel she is a strong candidate at this time for a tenure track position. However, I do support her candidacy for the ABSN program on the clinical track. They would benefit from having a strong cardiovascular clinician with research expertise and training. She would bring a nice blend of research, practice and project management to the class which is a good model for new nurses. If Ms. Davis is serious about the research career she has ahead she may want to consider a postdoc where her time would be protected and she could write and apply for external funding (because both publications in her area of research and applications for external funds are lacking). Alternatively, she could request to protect one semester in her first year at Duke as a clinical faculty member and she could solidify her ideas and submit for a K99/R00 to protect her time in years to come. I wish I was more excited about her second visit. She seemed to be looking for a job rather than creating a career</qualitative>

Key to her success here is she knows our student population, already has effective strategies to be successful with our students and has demonstrated the ability to set a high bar for our students in the clinical area. An expectation that course faculty have expected, students have positively responded to and that has worked. What is so impressive about her is her ability to deal with the marginally performing student with structure and compassion that has transformed students approach to patient care.   While she has &quot;growing edges&quot; that need attention in her teaching skills she is coachable and wants to improve. She has articulated a strong commitment to continuing her research by getting her dissertation in print and doing the next phase of her PhD research. She established relationships and plans underway to do some multi-site research to expand her current study and alter the demographics of her subject population.  I believe her to be the strongest of the 5 candidates we have interviewed. She has been has demonstrated her ability to work within the DUSON community.

<qualitative>Dr. Richesson&apos;s program of research would fit well with current nursing informatics research in DUSON as well as Duke Center for Health Informatics and DCRI. Additionally her ideas for student involvement in research and experiences with successfully involving Duke informatics students in her research projects demonstrate evidence of her ability to expand DUSON student learning opportunities.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I am delighted that she was invited to interview here. What an enormous resource she would be to the school and the Duke community. Her national connections, collaborations externally, and work already with DUSON grads, DCRI and DTMI are very attractive. My only criticism, albeit a compliment, may very well be dependent on her mentorship - there are a lot of opportunities for her here at Duke. A lot. If she is transitioning from a research faculty to tenure track faculty position, I hope she is focused enough to progress and prioritize her own research. It would be easy for her to become a generalist and a resource for everyone everywhere. I didn&apos;t get a clear sense from her presentation what HER program of research would be. She spoke of the grants she has under review but I couldn&apos;t tell if she was the co-I or PI and if the latter, if it was for the development of her program of research or the program of research for the rare disease group she works with.  I strongly support her candidacy.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Richesson was an engaging candidate.  She certainly has demonstrated scholarship through her publications and grants.  I was unable to attend her presentation -- which may have answered questions for me.  The primary question is does she fit the needs of our informatics program?  Are we hiring too many faculty who are not nurses?  I believe that Dr .Richesson would be a good team player -- she is incredibly talkative and sometimes over whelming -- her work history highlights collaboration.  She is talented -- do her talents fit our needs?  That is for the informatics faculty to answer.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Although Dr. Richesson does not have any significant teaching experience, I think that writing and editing a textbook in Informatics provides evidence of her ability to gather and organize significant topics in a particular area, thus these skillls would help her in the design of a curriculum. Additionally, she will be teaching an online course for DUSON in the Fall semester. Furthermore, she successfully mentored two of our DUSON students for their informatics practicum. Finally, her presentation was well organized and provided some evidence of her potential ability to effectively teach.   Dr. Richesson has a good program of research and has fostered interdisciplinary national and international collaborations. In addition, she has been able to secure funding and has many papers published in well-respected informatics journals. Although her research interests are different than ours, she would definitely bring another informatics area of expertise to the School of Nursing.  Through Dr. Richesson&apos;s national and international collaborations, she has the reputation to recruit practicum experiences for the students. Furthermore, through her reputation, she has the ability to attract strong students to the MSN program and potentially the PhD program.   I think Dr. Richesson would be an asset to the School of Nursing.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I will be out of the country next week and not able to meet and hear this Community Health applicant. She has good and exciting international experiences in developing parts of the world and  has been a CI for international experiences. Obviously, these experiences tend to be community oriented and her experience would  serve us well. However, I do not see academic preparation in community or public health. I feel a need for a strong candidate academically and experientially to give leadership to this very important part of the curriculum. It is not enough  to be a good clinical teacher with vast exposure.  Her leadership of a cultural competence committee is a plus, but community/public health is more than being culturally competent and appropriate.  It is probably inappropriate to contact you with my “read-only” impression, but since I will not be around, I needed to share  my perception.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Based only on her presentation and the discussion afterwards, she appears to have a lot to offer the ABSN community health &quot;team.&quot; I especially appreciated her perspective on community health education and the primary objective for all students in this area. Her global experience sounds ideal and she may even be able to look at what is currently done here at DUSON to offer opportunities for improvement and evaluation. Unsure if she would welcome the idea of expanding/improving our ABSN community health focus or be dissappointed that she has taken her current college&apos;s experiences in some areas beyond what is here at DUSON.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think this candidate has potential to contribute to the body of scholarship and teaching effort here at DUSON.  My concerns are that she has no experience in teaching community health in the classroom but has experience in teaching community health as a clinical preceptor.  I think that preceptor experience will translate well to the classroom.  My other concern is her lack of scholarly productivity.  She has only one book chapter published but no obvious journal articles but this may be a function of her current work environment and lack of emphasis on scholarly productivity and lack of mentorship.  With mentoring, which we can certainly provide her here, I think she would do well.  I like her enthusiasm with the use of technology in the classroom.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Michelle had terrific enthusiasm and was professional and innovative in her presentation.  However, she did not address experiences teaching in the local community, nor how her work in the trips abroad were combined with the learning that occurred in the classrooms at her current school.  There did not appear to be a link between the community health course and her abroad experiences.  ( I could be wrong, but it was how I percieved it.)  My understand is that we need a faculty memeber with expert skills in community nursing, who has demonstrated experiences building local relationships and has a background in public health or community health nursing.  I&apos;m not sure Michelle &quot;fits&quot; this need.  She would be great to work with OGCHIas a terrific clinical instructor for our trips abroad</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think this is a person who would work very hard.  The question is do we need a theoretical statistician versus an applied statistician.  He had a nice presentation style and some attempt at humor, he was clearly nervous throughout the day.  I am not sure how his English is when he is not nervous but understanding him required concentration and I am not sure our students would/could do that for 3 hours at a time.  If his writing in English is good then online teaching might be a better match. His talk was clearly for a statistically savvy audience of which there were at most two in attendance.  I do not see his contribution to research in his own area here at the school; he would be a better fit with a statistical department at Duke with other therotical statisticians. He said that doing his own reserch was impoartn and he wanted about 505 tine to do that not sure how that would work hee a the school it would limit his teachign and consultatin time which is what we need  a new faculty member to pickup. His publicati are in well respected journals.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I thought Mr. Wang was an engaging candidate.  He has excellent experience and six articles in good journals.  He struck me as a person who had a strong work ethic, a desire to succeed, and as someone who was honest in his responses.  We talked seriously about the research track and the tenure track.  He noted the ad suggested either was available.  The SON needs to be very clear with him as to which track will work for him.  His research seems to be in theoretical statistics -- it might be a stretch for this area to fit under our tenure track definition.  He also has experience supporting research as a methodogical collaborator and this clearly would fit our research track.  Even if he is hired in the research track (and he indicated a great delight in teaching and collaborating with researchers) I had the keen sense he would want some time to continue his own research.  One last comment.  Mr. Wang&apos;s command of English is good -- but also somewhat limited and some may have difficulty understanding all he has to say (this was evident in our meeting with him).  This could be problemmatic in teaching students or collaborating with faculty.  On the other hand, he might be very valuable in our collaboration with Schools of Nursing and Universities in China.  Dr. Bei Wu might be able to provide more useful information on such.

<qualitative>This candidate had strong statistical skills as evidenced by his presentation as well as his doctoral degree in public health. Because of these strong skills he has the potential to collaborate on research projects and to writing grants for research projects. There are several skills which he does not have and which would take time to develop. The first is teaching. It is unclear how well he could translate his statistical knowledge into what is needed in the school&apos;s PhD, DNP and master&apos;s level programs; which are all very applied courses. It is also unclear how well he could work with faculty to collaborate to write grants, although my sense is that he would learn to do this in a shorter time period than teaching.  I am a little confused now about his degree: is it in epidemiology or is it in biostatistics? It is not a PhD so my guess is that it is in epidemiology, but his CV syas biostatistics. The degree requirements for a DPH are not the same as those for a PhD.  Additional comments:  
-Other faculty may  thought Dr. Wang’s presentation to be overly technical and mathematical. However, unless he had been told otherwise, any candidate with a statistical skills will present his most statistical work. 
-His work would have relevance for us in the area of collaboration and grant writing. Although even in that area there would be a learning curve for him.
-The worry is teaching. I have no idea how he would do and there would be a learning curve in that area for sure. 
-I am suddenly confused about his degree. It  will be a DPH – is that in biostatistics or epidemiology? Oh it is in biostatistics and they do offer a DPH in biostatistics at UNC. Here is what it says abou the DPH - the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program is designed to prepare students for positions of leadership in applied research settings related to human health. Here is what it says for the PhD - Objectives The Doctor of Philosophy program is designed to provide advanced, research-oriented training in theory and methodology to prepare individuals for academic careers and for research positions in government and private industry.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Mrs. Edie presented a very interesting overview of her DNP work. Although she is enthusiastic about the topic she did not report plans to carry on her work in either the original setting for the study or in her clinical practice site. Although she has worked on funded grants, she does not include joint publications from that work. She reports extensive experience in clinical instruction but does not seem to have classroom or clinical teaching experience or innovations in delivery of advanced care concepts. Her passion for the disadvantaged is obvious and the suggestions she made to expand clinical placements were very thoughtful. She would be an excellent candidate for a clinical appointment but her lack of publication, ongoing plans for research and lack of classroom teaching experience might be prohibitive for long-term scholarship.</qualitative>

She has taught at DUSON with a 50% effort and would be interested in increasing her teaching effort to 80-90% with the remainder in clinical practice.  She has a great understanding of underserved populations as well as womens health and pediatrics.  This advanced practice experience would deepen the faculty experience and teaching depth and breadth.

<qualitative>Engaging, experienced and high energy.  Seems to be a terrific fit for the position.  Has held multiple appointments (almost doing two jobs at once) -- and while she has built research into the CRNA curriculum in her university -- she has not done any independent research.  Her approach to practice is however, scholarly and she is well read and as mentioned earlier engages students in small research projects.  Her publications are quite limited.  She has been an active member of her professional organization (AANA)regionally and nationally.  Since this would be her first full time faculty appointment (and she would have time to devote to research) she is struggling with tenure versus practice track.  I would suggest the practice track may be more appropriate.  I would hire this candiate.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Issel is definitely a senior professor and could contribute so much to the dearth of community health at our school. She brings fresh perspectives known in the public health world that have not been incorporated in curricula here at the school. I am not clear on how the Community Health call for applicants and the Case Management needs intersect, so my excitement about her is the potential to collaborate with her,  and what she could contribute to bringing the school in improved balance with expertise to collaborate with public health in North Carolina, and provide senior curricula leadership  outside of critical care.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Issel has had a productive career.  Her publications are numerous, and appear in good to excellent journals.  She also is the author of a book on Health Program Planning and Evaluation.  I found her to be engaging.  I did not, however, receive a satisfactory answer to her choosing to teach ABSN students, given her current teaching responsibilities with only/primarily doctoral students.  She has a significant record of funding – but it is primarily in funding from HRSA – and not research focused.  On the other hand, if she is appointed in the Practice track – this will be a strength.  Her talk was somewhat disappointing.  It was primarily a “basic education” on what public health nursing is, and what care management is.  She did list her grants – and when asked to discuss two of them – had very basic slides on one of the projects.  But there was nothing scholarly in these slides.  One had no idea of the N, the design, the analysis plan or the data supported outcomes.   I think she does have a very significant knowledge related to public health, particularly in regard to maternal health and the health of young children.  The decision to hire or not hire her really comes down to an evaluation of whether or not she will enthusiastically fulfill the requirements of the position.  I was not convinced.</qualitative>

<qualitative> I believe she wants to come to Duke but not sure it is for the right reasons.  She indicated she would be interested in tenure track (teach 3 courses a year), what with her described funding level which she says will transfer to Duke, means according to her that she would be available to teach 1 course a year… thus the community health and the 5 of the 6 case management courses would need to be taught by other TBD faculty. I thought her presentation was not effective- an overview of public health nursing then a list of her projects. She then asked the audience which one(s) she should talk about and when marva selected one she said she did not have the slides for that project.  Toward the end of the day she seemed more interested but her answers to questions in the morning were general, vague and lacked any enthusiasm.  The question was what value does she bring and is it of strategic importance</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Issel brings a systems-level perspective to developing public health nursing and community health nursing scholarship at DUSON—both from the perspective of developing specific, innovative teaching/learning experiences as well as how to move curriculum development forward in these areas.  I think her ability to think across programs would be a significant strength---that is, how to advance public health and community health nursing teaching/learning and research from pre-licensure to doctoral levels, including mentoring faculty and students.  During her interview, she demonstrated significant strengths in being able to reframe individual faculty perspectives on public health and community health nursing education and practice, which relates to her ability to grow school-level progress in these areas, rather than be limited to the ability to implement a single course in a single program.  Dr. Issel is clearly able to facilitate us moving forward in nursing education and research--- she discussed the relevance of developing case management courses in this context.
I think that we would miss a significant opportunity to contribute to our growth and innovation capacity by analyzing her candidacy with respect to whether she teaches a specific course---rather, her strengths relate to her ability to contribute to systems-level capacity—developing and mentoring faculty across multiple courses in multiple programs, and demonstrating and facilitating the connections between programs of empirical research and teaching/learning innovations.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I really enjoyed meeing Dr. Olson and hearing his thoughts about his journey into his expertise.  He clearly a very bright, articulate, and passionate professional.  He seems to have boundless energy, which is good for the position he seems to want.  I am a little concerned that in addition to his full-time faculty role, he is hoping to maintain (in addition) 12-20hrs/week at the bedside.  While I applaud his desire to keep up his clinical practice, I wonder to what extent it will impact his role as an educator.  It is clear he is a solid researcher, but in this new role, he will have to take on a new responsibility of teaching, which he currently is not doing.  One other concern is his very causual approach to the interview.  While I found it quite refreshing that he was so comfortable speaking with various groups of other professionals and this allowed him to impart his passion for his clinical area, he was almost &apos;too casual&apos; for an interview setting (i.e. slang and mild expletives) which makes me wonder how he will be presented to and received by our students.  DUSON is a fairly &apos;proper&apos; environment, that I&apos;m unsure whether he would fit.</qualitative>

<qualitative>It&apos;s difficult to make a judgment about someone who is so well-know and well-loved here at Duke. The interview was very casual and the candicate did not seem to make any effort to impress us. I was please by his willingness to step up to the whiteboard and show us how he would teach the cranial nerves, but was less impressed by the demonstration than I was hoping to be. My concern is that Daiwai is very cionfident and sure of his abilities but less expienced and knowledgeable in teaching and learning than he is confident about his presentation skills. He has a waelth of knowledge about neuroscience and made some attempt to connect this to learning, but I was not convinced he is able to translate this to his teaching practice. His clinical experinece and connections would be extremely valuable to the ABSN program, but with his keen interest in developing as a researcher I wonder if he might be better suited to the research track.</qualitative>

She would add strength and depth in our clinical MSN courses as well as in the concentration of cardiology.  She has excellent connections within DUHS and would be a good strategic hire for us.  She was hand picked by Dr. Fulkerson to lead the Advanced Practice Provider group at DUHS.  The only shortcoming that was revealed to me was a minor lack of understanding of what the full scope of a regular rank faculty members responsibilities would include.

<qualitative>This is an excellent candidate for the clinical track position.  Ruth:  I was completing my evaluation form this morning for Meg Carman.  I wanted to let you know that she is exactly the kind of candidate we are looking for the adult health clinical track position. She is clinically current and competent, interested in growing in the role of nurse educator.  Having had the opportunity to observe her directly since August, in her role as a fixed-term consulting associate, I have found Meg to consistently be a team played, a person who has consistently pitched-in to get the work done, worked diligently to prepare a significant number of new lectures, and been a contributing member to the ABSN learning community.  Her currency of clinical, positive attitude and true interest/desire to be involved in pre-licensure education is exactly the type of person needed for the ABSN program.  Please feel free to share my comments with the search committee if you feel appropriate.  Michael</qualitative>

<qualitative>How did this person make it through the search committee screen? I was not impressed with her research or how she presented it…nothing came alive. I hear from CND people that she is much better with students 1:1. But I would caution the search committee that &quot;good clinical nurses do not a teacher make.&quot; I am concerned that she does not have a strong base in teaching…that this is new to her list of skills. While she seems okay, I found her to be &quot;so-so.&quot; What is more important is that she has been inappropriate in her current role in the program committee meetings. She offers opinions about things that she does not yet understand the background on issues. I think this is a RED FLAG. Shows her lack of understanding about determining the culture and getting to know what is going on, before she offers opinions. I know that one member of the ABSN team is really pushing for her hire. That makes me more suspicious of her.  I am not in favor of her hire because it does not look like we have required of her the same level of expertise in teaching that we have of other candidates. Seems like we are pushing these last two candidates through very fast. Why the rush?   This form does not ask the right questions,  about potential to be good in the claasroom and as part of the ABSN team? I do not see it, yet in her. Maybe in time, but not right now.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Carmen gave a very engaging presentation to the faculty, and it was clear that she is passionate about both her clinical area but also nursing in general.  This will translate well in the classroom for students and she will be an excellent role model for our ABSN students.  She is very approachable, flexible, and open for feedback.  I feel like she would be a very good team player and contributor to the ABSN faculty.  It was clear during her interview that she sees teaching as something she is truly drawn to, not something that she just has to do to ensure her professional livlihood.  Her clincal knowledge is both extensive and current, and she also maintains her advanced practice skills; this will make her relevent in the master&apos;s program as well as the ABSN program.  Finally, she is a graduate of Duke (MSN, DNP) and therefore knows the culture, knows the system, and her current role as a one-year contact faculty member will make a transition into a faculty role smooth.</qualitative>

<qualitative>This is an incredibly difficult evaluation for me. On one hand -- I found the candidate engaging, his publication record is remarkable for a nurse clinican, and he has some consistant research dollars and a passion for research.  He is grounded in clincial problems and research to solve such problems.  Yet at the end of the day given his presentation-- one questions what he has discovered. He claims the &quot;context of care&quot; -- which seemed to clearly engage our clinical faculty -- and yet I was left wondering is this really feasible and does his research really support such.  My hope is that our Associate Dean for Research will weigh in on Dr. Olson&apos;s research trajectory and possibilities.  She has worked with him on an RO1, and will have far greater knowledge of his research promise.  I also attended his presentataion.  It was a world tour of all of his work -- so one could not really evaluate methodologies and interpretation of findings,  Yet he was incredibly engaging -- a powerful presenter -- I felt as if I were in the presence of someone with a fantastic stage performance.  And as a nurse clinican he has done done remarkable things. Yet in his presentation &quot;performance&quot; -- I think he made some of our colleagues uncomfortable (including me).  And although I think it was not intended -- his presentation included dramatic renditions of  - for example - the southern dialetic in a vinette of &quot;he&apos;s dead&quot;   -- the focus on the southern accent of a seemingly uneducated or at least not well educated nurse could offend members of our community.  I am quite sure he did not intend such -- but his presentation  was on stage dramatic -- not scholarly.  He was powerful -- but I could not shake the feeling that &quot;something was not quite right.&quot;  He could be a powerful teacher in the ABSN progrm -- but I am ambivalent about this candidate.  If I had to tip the balance in a decisionn --  I would be wary in offering him a position. But I would defer to ABN colleagues.  In my discussion with him as chair of the APT Committee, it was clear that he was interested in a tenure track position.  He has a keen interest in furthering his research career and looks forward to research mentoring he would receive from the SON Research Center.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I understand she has been a CI for us in the past and is apparently great in that role. I did not get a chance to hear how much other traditional teaching experience she has had; although, she conveyed a desire to think about innovative and student-centered practices for teaching from IEE and other faculty, as well as a desire to be active in and learn from the curriculum revision efforts. As far as scholarship, I would have liked to hear more reflection in her talk on the levels of evidence for the research-driven practice changes that she&apos;s been involved in, but it appears superficially that she is capable of critically evaluating the science that should be translated.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I have a high stake in the selection of the health policy faculty member so I am providing specific feedback after having a good amount of time with Dr. Holland.  First and foremost - Dr. Holland originally applied for the junior researcher position at DUSON and expressed her surpirse in being interviewed for the &quot;health policy&quot; position.  She expressed concern that she does not see herself as a fit for the policy position and fears that the lack of fit will reduce her changes of being offered the job.  Her best fit, she feels, is in the junrio researcher position.  Dr. Holland&apos;s immediate plans are to apply for a K award from NINR.  Since the health policy position was created in direct response to a documented need for teaching faculty in the DNP program, winning a K award would remove Dr. Holland from fulfilling the primary purpose the position was created to solve.  Dr. Holland is NOT (I can not say this strongly enough) educated nor experientially qualified to teach N655 Health Systems Transformations.   With strong mentoring and a lot of my time, Dr. Holland could teach probably N652 Transforming the Nation&apos;s Health (the policy course).  Her Phd program was indeed titled &quot;Health Policy and Administration&quot; as was my DrPH program.  In the Senate I learned quickly having 2 courses in health policy from faculty with no political or policy experience did NOT provide a substantive background in health policy.  Dr. Holland has had one course in policy analysis.  She has conducted zero advocacy.  She does not follow health policy except as it applies to her area of research.  She does not know policy priorities and issues facing nurses nor does she know the nuances related to policy and nursing....recent pressures to change such as LACE, FON report, RAND report, Carnegie report.  Neither of the two courses the in which the DNP program needs faculty are good fits for Dr. Holland.   Dr. Holland has never taken an online course nor taught online.  She mentioned having &quot;some online content&quot; available to students in the courses in which she gave guest lectures but she was unclear beyond that statement.  She has never managed a full semester course.  She states that she is &quot;good at explaining complex subjects in simple way&quot; but when asked if she could translate that skill from a face to face setting to an online setting she is visible jarreed and admits that she has no idea how to do that.  Dr. Holland is highly qualified to teach N404 Health Economics (which could use a second section) but N404 has not been identified as a priority for resourcing.  She seemed happy at the suggestion of teaching economics and shared some of the health econ books she likes.  With her MPH and population based research, Dr. Holland is highly qualified to teach N301 Population Based Approaches to Health and exhibited some excitement about the prospect.   
In summary:  I do not recommend Dr. Holland for the position of health policy faculty.</qualitative>

<qualitative>The position flyer says this is a &quot;full time faculty position&quot; that will have primary responsibility for teaching health policy in the Doctor of Nursingn Practice (DNP) program.&quot;  Dr. Holland, though bright and eager to begin health a faculty role, is not a fit for this description.  She has a health services researcher preparation but has only served as a TA or guest lecturer, has not taught or taken an online course, has limited knowledge of the nursing profession and has limited scholarship.  We&apos;d be doing her and our DNP students a disservice to appoint her to this description.  On the other hand, if we are interested in an additional junior researcher and want to extend our faculty who have health services research preparation, she would fit.  She said she could teach research courses and I think her education would prepare her to teach population health which with CPI will probably be embedded in more than N301.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr Holland appears to be a solid junior scientist and that role seems to be more of a fit than the policy position.  She has limited teaching experience ( a two week course) and has not tught online before .  Her interpersonal skills are not great which might make it easier for her to teach online than a classroom.  She is not a nurse and I wonder if we now have too many non nures which limits the breath of courses in which they can teach. She did not seem to have an interest in teahcing policy and I got the sense she thought she was interviewing for a reseracher position. I would defer to nancy short for her assessment of her ability to teach the required coures in policy.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Holland&apos;s presentation was evidenced-based in maternal and child health; she would do very well in a maternal child health/public health based maternal child health course. However, her CV nor her presentaiton were congruent with policy teaching needs of DUSON courses, particularly not appropriate for the DNP policy course.</qualitative>

<qualitative>This is a very talented candidate.  A bit talkative -- but also high energy. She would contribute greatly to enhancing our reputation in pediatrics, and also build on beginning focus in pain management.  I think she would be an excellent addition to our SON.  Her potential for funded research is significant, and given her clinical area, research expertise and work in translational (research to practice) expertise she would be a welcome addition to the DNP program and to DTNI.  She is also quite capable of teaching pediatrics and research across all programs.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I was not impressed. I do not think he is very focused, and I was surprised that he had to ask us what an independent program of research is. Someone with a PhD from UNC should know that. I am even more surprised that he submitted an R01 without any mentoring…I believe it speaks to an inflated view of his capabilities.  I think our description of what he would need to do to establish a program of research was sobering for him. It seemed to really take the wind out of his sails, which is troubling; I would’ve preferred a response more along the lines of “Wow! Great! I will get the help I need!”  He concluded one of his sentences with “You dig?” That alone is enough to be a dealbreaker for me.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I am not sure what was communicated to Dr. Olson about the purpose of the second visit.   When I met with Dr. Olson at this second visit, I started the conversation making certain that he had an opportunity to get his questions answered.  His response was, “I do not have any questions.  I really don’t know why I am here today”.  I shared with him that this was an opportunity to have a follow-up conversation about faculty roles/responsibilities in the ABSN program and DUSON overall.  As such, I talked about his involvement in advising, committee work, teaching and continuing his scholarship.  During Dr. Olson’s first visit, we discussed this adult health position as part of a continuum of courses – fundamentals, pharm, patho, adult health, geriatrics.  During the first visit, I shared with him that an area of critical need is pharmacology.  During this second visit, Dr. Olson stated that he only understood this position to be “to teach in the adult health course”.  I again clarified with him the continuum of courses, the annual faculty bidding process used to cover this continuum of courses, and the desire/process for having a clearly articulated teaching load as part of the hiring process.  During this conversation, he repeatedly stated that he was interested in teaching in the adult health course.  Through this conversation, I sensed rigidity and inflexibility as part of a team to cover the courses of the program.  Throughout the conversation, Dr. Olson did not seem genuinely interested in the position.  When the conversation ended, I did not sense that Dr. Olson would be a flexible team player.  Although an inexperienced educator, he did not identify any areas where he would need guidance as an educator.  Further, I also sensed that he might be very difficult to coach/mentor as a junior faculty member.   This is alarming since, whether new or experienced, all of us have areas for improvement as educators, scientists, colleagues, etc.  Overall, I do not believe Dr. Olson is a “good fit” for the position.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I was unable to attend the presentation but met with Dr. Rodgers for dinner. It was a difficult to determine what her potential is due to lack of interaction on her part. There were multiple questions that we asked in an attempt to facilitate conversation but they were basically one word answers and did not lend to determining her fit with DUSON. She did not have any questions for us and there were three junior faculty members there that could have given her great insight. Again, my contact with her was limited and she may have been overly saturated with information. My other concern was her ability to function as a researcher on her own or was she simply making this transistion due to her mentor accepting a position here. She did not seem to feel she could perform as a researcher at her current location since Dr. Hockenberry has left but did not elaborate on why.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I really liked this candidate.  She was engaging, humble and knowledgeable.  She related well to faculty and responded well to questions. I did question why she would leave UCSF in a tenured and funded chair position.  My sense was that she was not happy with the economics of the California University system -- and perhaps what the dean of UCSF was asking of faculty (fund your position and department?).  Her research work is with Chinese Americans in China Town in SF.  I don&apos;t think there is a comparable population here.  She may be able to transition to different cultural groups here -- but if one considers the Asian population in the Triangle (and the numbers are considerable in Wake County) - I don&apos;t think the majority are Chinese. So she might have to make a big cultural shift.  I think she would be a great teacher, would be able to contribute to the PHD program and mentor students and junior faculty.  I am less certain about her ability to continue to obtain grant funding given the relocation.  Perhaps she could link with Bei Wu and develop research studies that compared populations in China versus immigrants from China in the US.   Many positives -- worry about funding for future grants.</qualitative>

Her funded projects would be great educational opportunities for PhD students to learn research/project director skills.  Her experience will phenomenology as a qualitative method would also be extremely valuable for teaching students and consulting with other qualitative researchers in campus.

I think she has strong methodological training and solid research skills and experience. I see tremendous professinalism and enthusiasm for her research, and I think this would have a positive impact on DUSON students and faculty. She is pleasant and very articulate. I am certain that she can interact with faculty in DUSON, DMC, and Durham community to develop research programs and opportunities.  Her teaching, mentoring experience are stellar.  Her research is high impact and significant. Clearly she has what it takes to write grants and get funded. I will point out that for a senior researcher position, she might have fewer grants as PI than might be expected.  I am not sure what the expectation here is.  I also see that she will need to shift gears in terms of research interestes here (lower Asian population than in California) but I think she has the skills to do so.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Enjoyed meeting this candidate.  I was impressed with her publication record, and the fact that she did a two year post doc at Michigan. The downside was that she is just beginning intervention work -- and I was not terribly impressed with her intervention approach.  I think the person who could provide the most important feedback regarding this candidate is Dr. Lipkus.  He has incredible knowledge related to her area of research and was able to answer questions that she couldn&apos;t directly answer during her presentation.  I am lukewarm about her recruitment.  I hope Dr. Lipkus can help.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I think her areas of research interest would fit well with many faculty at Duke. I was not impressed with her presentation, finding it rather average. In particular, her way of thinking of the issues were not novel in both design and theory. However, with adequate mentoring in the area of tobacco control issues, she does have the potential to make significant contributions. Having more researchers doing primary prevention would be a welcome addition to DUSON</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Morgan&apos;s presentation regarding removing barriers to anesthesia care in the developing world was very interesting and informatative regarding the challenges of providing surgical services as part of a mission trip.    He discussed student selection for global service trips and what factors students need to consider when choosing if a mission trip is right for them.  Although he did not address teaching strategies specifically during his presentation he was able to articulate what students would need to know to be successful in completing a clinical roation as a CRNA student in a developing country.  Dr. Morgan&apos;s presentation and CV do not showcase his ability as a scholar he has no peer reviewed publications and has mainly taught as a guest lecturer with some clinical teaching [although I am not sure at what instituation due to the format of his CV].  It was also unclear as to his capstone project at Hopkins since this research was not highlighted during his presentation nor in his CV.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Mr. Morgan&apos;s presentation was acceptable but probably not his best. He does, however have innovative strategies with regard to clincial and didactic instruction (some of which he has implemented in the course he currently teaches.  I do think he was nervous and a bit intitmated by being at &quot;Duke.&quot;  His adminstrative experience was evident by the types of questions he asked regarding the APD position and by his stated perspective of the future of nurse anesthesia education.  He is motivated and excited about the possibility of being on the faculty and he has excellent ideas for how he might &quot;fit in.&quot;  He understands that he assume the the role of lead faculty on Pharmcology (I and II).</qualitative>

<qualitative>Although Dr. Moussa was pleasant and engaging, his presentation lacked polish. He struggled with understanding and responding to a question related to his research project. He does have experience teaching in courses such as physical assessment and sexual and reproductive health and his preferred teaching style is case based learning with a focus on mastery. During our interview he offered broad responses and did not inquire about any specifics related to becoming faculty at DUSON. At this time I believe he would benefit from further mentoring in presenting a research project to an academic audience.</qualitative>

His teaching style during the presentation was clear, organized, confident with appropriate use of theory and humor.  I believe he would make an excellent addition to the faculty, bringing intellectual diversity and a broader worldview, which I believe would fill and important gap for our faculty. Additionally, he holds great potential in the area of research, since community based research is a weak area on our faculty.  Although, a beginning researcher ies, he demonstrates innovation and passion for community baseed research. From conversation, he demonstrates that he is a competent, practitioner, whose is certified in the appropriate area.  Hire him!</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Moussa is a very warm and personable individual. He appears to be very professional and articulate. I cannot be sure, but I imagine that he could be an effective and responsive care provider and teacher. Because this is a teaching position, it would be nicefor the selection committee to get more details on his teaching experience (perhaps you already have this), because it is not clear from his CV.  (He says FT faculty but also had clinical and other positions overlapping in this time period.)   I was dissappointed by his presentation. While Dr. Moussa was energitic and passionate, I thought he actaully had very little to say in his presentaiton. To me, the presention demonstrated 2 things: 1.) a lack of fundamental research training (no validated instrument, poor description of intervention and only rudimentary statistical analysis that was clearly done by someone else), and 2.) His poor teaching style (the ppt slides were endless, the data were presented quite poorly), it lacked innovation in the presentation.  While I understand that the research expertise is not a job requirement, I think the ability to present work and data clearly is a critical and mimumal requirement for any faculty position at Duke.  Dr. Moussa could have given a much better description of the e-learning tool - including visualizations to engage the audience and illustrate the difference between the e-learning and the paper version. And while the pre-post comparison statistics were appropriate and well done, a set of descriptive statistics, neatly presented and discussed, would have been more than adequate.  I do want to iterate again that I see tremendous strengths in his personality and warmth, which might translate to good skills teaching and recruitment and engagement of students. However, based on his presentation, I saw no evidence of potential for effective and innovative teaching or scholarship.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I enjoyed meeting with this candidate, although I was unable to attend his presentation -- so my comments are limited.  He has an interesting professional background, and has been teaching a number of FNP courses in his current position.  He has a keen interest in global health.  His CV however, is not strong, by his account he has submitted at least two additional publications.  And while I found the candidate personable -- he sometimes struggled in answering questions.  I am not certain how many FNP positions we have in the clinical track.  I would rate this candidate lower than others we have interviewed -- but he does have some unique qualities.</qualitative>

<qualitative>A lovely man, who clearly is positioning himself as a researcher. By his own admission he has &quot;never designed, led or even knows how to lead a course.&quot; He admits his teaching experience is confined to 2-3 guest lectures in 2005 and grading papers as a TA. His &quot;excellence in teaching award&quot; was non-nursing and related to putting together a health fair at his church. He was poortly prepared for this interview…he knew nothing about the pre-liscensure program at Duke, including that it was accelerated. He did not know the job description, beyond the opportunity to do his research. Admitted that he spent his time preparing by reviewing faculty bios and trying to figure out who might mentor him in his research…perhaps he did not read the job description? Was a little taken back by the fact that he would be advisinig students, serving on committees and being part of activities in the program, like curriculum redesign.  He has no acute care experience and has incredibly unrealistic expectations for his trajectory at DUSON as evidenced by his goal statement at the end of his formal presentation. He expressed concern at how&quot; these other activities&quot; (like teaching and an advising load) would impact his &quot;tenure clock?&quot;The only place I could even remotely see him is in gero and it looks like we have that filled?  Bottom line: No match exists between his skills and abilities and our needs (job was for an adult position in the ABSN program). Granted he has been mentored by our soon to be vice dean and he is diverse. He gave the clear impression he would &quot;do whatever Duke wants me to do&quot; to obtain a position here. That said,  he is not a fit….would not be a match for our ABSN students and the equivelent experience that our faculty have in teaching and clinical practice. Perhaps he would be a good post-doc? But not a faculty position. His skills and experience are one dimensional and do not meet the criteria for this position….mainly because he has no interest in teaching and cannot provide any flexibility in skills to the ABSN Program. A very nice man, with a nice personality.</qualitative>

<qualitative>It is unfortunate that this candidate was brought here to interview for a position that clearly requires teaching.  According to the job listing: &quot;Possible teaching acticvities of this position could include fundamentals/ health assessment, pathophysiology, pharmacology and or adult health (med surg nursing).&quot; Does the word possible mean that he really doesn&apos;t have to teach??   Not only has this candidate never worked in an acute care setting, but he worked in LTC over 4 years ago and did mostly administration and sparse patient care.  On top of that, his &quot;teaching experience&quot; is as a TA, in which he graded papers and &quot;did a few guest lectures&quot;.  Does that count as teaching experience?  It doesn&apos;t according to the NC Board of Nursing or our APT committee.  He couldn&apos;t remember exactly what or how many lectures he did though as they were so long ago.  Beyond what the faculty needs are for competent teachers, do our students not deserve someone who at least has taught, or taken students to clinical, or maybe even precepted students at least once or twice?  If his program of research is so crucial to bring him here, please add him to our Gero faculty and Not Adult Health.   On top of that, he did absolutely no prep for knowing about DUSON.  He never heard about OGACHI or MADIN, and knew very little to nothing about the ABSN Program.  When told about advising and committee work, he asked if he would still have to take a full assignment if his research was in full swing.  He hadn&apos;t really put much thought into what the teaching repsonsibilities would be because his focus is research.  Please, do not fill this position with someone who will not help us teach these students.</qualitative>

<qualitative> I believe Michael would be a great addition to the DUSON faculty and a great mentor/role model, especially for the men and students of color that are here, but I didn&apos;t see evidence of his TEACHING ability for the ABSN students, or his passion for that particular position.  His teaching experiences are limited, though he appears to love &quot;learning&quot;, mentoring, nursing research and seems eager to continue to be at Duke.  His focus in the presentation seemed to be about the desire to develop his program of research, which is a great match for our faculty that are working in Gero/Adult health, etc but I’m not sure it fits our need for an additional classroom teacher.  He would be terrific teaming with our community of researchers and with mentoring would be a great addition to our program, if he is wanting to develop his classroom/teaching approach AS WELL as his research.  He appears comfortable presenting and sharing his knowledge but has not acute care adult health experiences a bedside nurse, making it difficult to translate the experience to students.  I would want to ask more about his willingness to teach foundational nursing content, actively work with the current Adult-health faculty, etc.  He may have addressed this in the other sessions I was unable to attend.  In the presentation, he was very focused on the research work and how he would continue that in the future.</qualitative>

<qualitative>While Mr. Cary seems like a very pleasant individual who would likely mesh well within our community, I do not think he has the background in both clinical expertise and teaching to be able to serve our students effectively.  It was my impression he was being recruited to fill the role of an adult health expert, but in discussions with this candidate, he has limited experience at the bedside having only worked in LTC; no acute care experience.  While this would allow him to teach certain clinical classes such as Foundations and Gero, he is not suited to teach Adult Health, which is significant need.  Additionally, he lacks significant teaching experience, and did not really express much interest in developing this skill set- he seems very focused on his research program.  While this is a very important component, especially since he is pursuing a tenure track position, we all have obligations to not only teach within our respective programs, but also do so in an effective and innovative way.  Like I have said, he did not seem to offer much interest in this particular area.  Additionally, he did seem to have prepared himself about the various aspects of DUSON prior to this interview; for example, he had not heard of MADIN and was unclear about our ABSN program in terms of number of semesters, criteria for entrance, etc.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Mr. Cary is fundable and has many funding options as a nurse, interested in both patient and system-level outcomes. There are a lot of people at Duke for him to collaborate with and senior mentorship will be key to his success. His reason for not getting a post-doc when there are so many in his area of research was practical (needs financial stability for his family) but weak from a career trajectory perspective (my opinion). I suppose not everyone needs post-doc training to be successful but he did change research interests three times over his doctoral training and he doesn&apos;t seem very focused. Again, senior mentorship (he has chosen Dr. Anderson) will be important particularly as he seeks K-level/Hartford/RWJ career development awards.   ***I feel that the needs of the ABSN program are somewhat unique and there is a risk of recruiting entry-level tenure-track candidates who are aiming for career development awards that may conflict with the teaching needs of an intense teaching program. So I am unable to make a recommendation on his candidacy because I feel this choice should reside with the ABSN team and leadership.***</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Tiffani Bright is a very junior candidate for our faculty position and would require an extensive amount of mentoring and training. We were under the impression when we invited her to come to interview that she had a traditional post-doc experience with Dr. David Lobach under the AHRQ contract.  However, she functioned as a team member under this contract and was mainly conducting the literature review. She did not write any grants during this post-doc experience.  Although she presented this work to us as her own, Dr. David Lobach was the PI on this contract.  It probably would have been better if she had presented her dissertation work. It was clear that she wasn&apos;t fully informed on all of the work because she couldn&apos;t adequately address several of the questions posed to her.  I was particularly concerned that she couldn&apos;t address questions I posed to her on the heterogeneity results of the meta-analysis.  Furthermore, she did not have any grant writing experiences during her doctoral program and mentioned that she just worked on faculty funded grants.  When we asked her about her program of research, she said that she would like to work in the hospital part-time to get some ideas about the informatics problems. Basically, she doesn&apos;t have any ideas about the focus of her future research.   With regard to teaching, she mentioned that she could teach classes on decision-support and usability engineering, yet she did not know about the basics of building decision-support systems such as rule based systems, bayesian belief networks, influence diagrams, etc… Furthermore, she has very little experience and training in usability engineering.Usability engineering is significantly more than heuristic evaluation.   My biggest concern with this candidate is her ability to build a program of research, learn to teach and advise students, and be involved in service work at the same time.  If she at least had an idea about a program of research or was continuing to build on her dissertation research, this would be very workable.  However, we need a full-time faculty member devoted to our program, not a half-time faculty member who works part-time in the hospital and part-time in the program.

<qualitative>Dr. Bright presented her work in a professional manner, but she lacked the ability to field questions following her presentation. It appeared that she did not know the data well and lacked a working knowledge of recent papers related to her topic of interest. She would have been better served presenting her doctoral dissertation b/c she was not prepared for the presentation she delivered. This candidate fulfills our interest in hiring diverse faculty members, but I am not convinced she has a strong research platform or the abiltiy to secure external research funding.  She does demonstrate ability to work in large interdisciplinary team. Dr. Bright is not a nurse so she will not be able to teach ABSN and will be limited to master&apos;s / informatics track - although this is probably ok as per position description, may be worth noting.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I enjoyed meeting and speaking with Tiffani. She is bright, very articulate, hardworking and highly motivated. However, upon speaking with her on 3 different meetings during her visit, it is clear to me that she is very inexperienced in teaching and research and informatics, and not clear on the nature of a faculty position.  While DUSON could certainly provide her mentoring for both teaching and research, I worry that she does not have enough experience (within university setting) to make a truly informed decision about whether this is a match for her. Her resume does indicate her experience as a Teaching Assistant, but it seems it was more of an administrative role and Tiffani was not engaged in the course content in any way. Also, she was not exposed to grant writing in her doctoral program on any level - either as a course, through observation, or in writing a research proposal of any kind herself.

What concerns me the most is that I do not think Tiffani has a solid focus or research interest area within informatics. Her disseration and post-doc were on two completely different topics, so she does not have any depth of experience or coursework in any one area.  I had hoped that her affiliation with Dr. Suzanne Bakken (doctoral advisor) and a school of nursing would give her perspective and understanding of nursing or clinical care that she could give to our students with nursing backgrounds, but, it does not appear that there was a strong relationshio or affiliation there (my personal guess). I believe that Tiffani&apos;s dissertation   topic was given to her by a faculty member and not reflective of her interests or quest.  The work that she presented in her talk was certainly very well done, but I think she was a team member of a literature review and meta-analysis project that was defined, designed, and analyzed and interpretted entirely by others.  I was concerned that she did not demonstrate a clear understanding of some of the concepts she presented (e.g,. Publication bias) as well as basic research methodology. While it was overall a nice report she described - and truly excellent presentation on her part - it is clear that she does not have any depth or breadth of undrestanding in Clinical Decision Supoprt to effectly teach a course by that name in the informatics program. 

Because she lacks applied experience in any healthcare discipline, or with applied informatics, it will be a tremdendous challenge for her to develop learning exercies and meaningful examples to engage students. (I know because I am non-clinical background and it is a struggle for me but I have a bit more experiences to draw from.)   She clearly is yearning for some experience with information systems, and expressed interest on a 50% hospital position and 50% DUSON.  While that would give her great insight, connections, experience, and gernerate research ideas, I fear that will leave her less engaged in teaching and advising students. I resepect and admire this request, because informatics problems are applied problems, and it would be terrific to have these connectsions. Overall, I worry that Tiffani does not yet have concrete ideas for research projects and grant proposals, and that will take some time to even be ready to start the grant writing.  

Tiffani is undoubtedly smart and has great communications skils and great potential to be an educator, if she wants to, but at this time, I believe she does not have enough knoweldge of any one area of informatics to teach most of the classes we offer in the informatics program (nor she did not express any confidence in that to me.)  She does have great communication and social skills, and I could see her successfully working well with others and engaging in projects across the Duke Medical Center and campus.  I worry that she will be overwhelmed in this position as she needs support to increase her informatics knowledge, practical skills and knowledge in informatics, research concepts, grant writing, and teaching, as well as advising and overseeing applied informatics practica. I think it will take her some time to gain the needed experience and skills, and ultimately might not be successful. I am also not sure if she is truly interested in a faculty position or a research career. I see from her webpage that she has interests in consulting and applied informatics work in hospitals. With all that said, she is bright and motivated and has great potential for successes in informatics, just not sure that she is a match for our needs at this time.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I only attended her presentation. She presented her postdoc work on research synthesis for other researchers. The presentation was good and clear, but I am not sure what would be her own original research interests/agenda if she were hired by DUOSN. My concern was also from her CV which shows that after she graduated from Columbia in 2009 she published only two peer-reviewed journal articles – one of the two is the research synthesis she presented. Her CV also does not indicate any research grant activties. I would not to recommend this candidate, but I do not have other candidates to compare with.

<qualitative>Peggy Bush was a delightful candidate for this position. Although I was not able to attend her presentation, she was able to clearly articulate the importance of relating pharmacology content to pre licensure and advanced practice nursing students in a manner that translated to clinical practice. Although her experience in teaching nurses is remote, she was comfortable in our discussion of academic challenges including student expectations and managing workload. She is comfortable in oncology pharmacology from a research perspective and would be an excellent addition to research teams. I think she would be able to partner with a clinical faculty member to teach pharmacology in the ABSN, MSN (neonatal, pediatric and adult ) and CRNA programs.</qualitative>

<qualitative>Dr. Bush appears to be a good candidate for a teaching position in the area of pharmacology based on her education, experience, and knowledge in this area.  She will need to make the transition from teaching non-clinicians to teaching studenst who will use the knowledge in practice and to meet an examination reguirement to practice. Athough she has some recent experience as a consultant in organizing clinical studies with drug companies there is no evidence of her ability to be an independent resarcher and grant writer. That being said,  this is not an apparent focus of the position description and I expect there will be value in having her as a consultant and participant on medication related clinical studies initiated by other faculty members.  She could not specifically elaborate what her area of scholarship would be and she has no recent publications; however, this has not been an important part of her current teaching position.</qualitative>

<qualitative>I appreciated her education work and how she has applied her understanding of meeting student needs.  Her style ensures that the pharmacology education is applicable and valuable.  Not clear if she has worked with NURSES in the past and has a good idea about how the Pharmacology courses are incorporated into our cirriculum.  If she discussed this in the other portion of the interview, that would be valuable information to consider.  I would like to know how she would work with others to develop this course content and how it could be adapted to both the under-graduate and graduate students who require this content.

Dr Bush&apos;s presentation from an education prespective, was dissppointing.

<qualitative>Dr. Feifan Liu research interest of natural language processing is of interest to the informatics community and is a fundable area of research.  His research presentation was quite engaging and he was a good speaker explaining quite a complex topic in an understandable manner. This clearly showed evidence of his teaching ability.  I was quite concerned about his misunderstanding about the profession of nursing where he had no idea that nurses obtained doctoral degrees, particularly PhDs and did not understand that nurses even conduct research. He didn&apos;t have any interest in collaborating with SON faculty, but his main interest was only collaboration with those in computer science. He was also only interested in hearing about the development of the Health Informatics PhD program which is currently in the discussion phase within the Duke Center for Health Informatics.  In general, he just didn&apos;t seem that interested in the School of Nursing. I have no doubt that he would be successful in teaching our technical courses but he didn&apos;t seem to have any indepth knowledge of the healthcare system which I fear would limit his ability to teach other informatics courses.  He also only had interest in potential PhD students and was quite surprised that he would have to mentor Master&apos;s and Certificate students. He was also very surprised that he would have to be involved in service work at the school. The final issue that arose was workload and he seemed concerned that he would potentially have to work on weekends.  In the end, I am not clear that he would be good fit at the SON.</qualitative>
