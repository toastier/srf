<Comment>New PhD with only 1 year of undergrad teaching in Korea in 99-00.  Has been APRN since 01 but practiced as NP only in 07-08 … why?  Seems to have good research foundation but needs to build own program of research.  Nice awards for dissertation workSome publications.  Seems to have potential but (as above) would be a very junior faculty.  Is that what we want?</Comment>

<Comment>PhD not completed though likely. I&apos;m confused about her area of expertise .. Health promotion? Trauma? Community health? Psych? Child health? Women&apos;s health?  Some teaching experience but limited. Appointment as Associate Prof unlikely.Multiple sources of funding for dissertation .. speaks to initiative.  Peer-reviewed publications &amp; national presentations though early in her career.  Would seem to have potential if we were seeking a very junior faculty, but if we want someone who can &quot;hit the ground running&quot; and be more &quot;seasoned,&quot; I do not think this is the candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. O&apos;Connell is a senior scientist with extensive teaching experience.  She continues to publish, but it would be interesting to know if she has a new grant in the works.  I assume she has extensive teaching experience, but courses taught do not appear on her CV (unless I missed them)</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. O&apos;Connell is an accomplished scholar with a distinguished record of research on health behaviors, using smoking cessation as her primary focus. Since leaving Kansas, there does not seem to be additional studies. She is currently  Program Coordinator in Teacher Education. Her teaching emphasis has been teacher education over her career. . She has a distinguished list of publications and until recently, a consistent list of funded research projects reflecting a progressive process of building her science. Unclear what specific role she is being considered to hold.</Comment>

Her experiences as a research analyst, data management and biostatistics Core staff member for UNC Medicine, the DCRI position and a teaching background make her a priority interview.

<Comment>This is a junior faculty member who has padded her CV a bit much (papers in deelopment should not be listed as publications). However, her DM focus is interesting.

<Comment>Currently working on PhD and is in the dissertation phase. We passed on this candidate in August and she sent me her CV during a Hartford conference call. Her cover letter in August indicated she was looking for a teaching position which seems odd as she has trained as a researcher. With planned expansion of ABSN program would consider a phone conversation based on her treaching experience</Comment>

However, given we have other peds faculty that could currently teach the ABSN pediatric course and that our greatest need for the masters program is in the Peds Acute and Chronic Care program, I would suggest asking this candidate to resubmit when she closer to graduation which would allow us to re-evaulate our closer to graduation.</Comment>

Unclear what sie does as an &quot;Education &amp; Research Consultant&quot; since &apos;92.  I see no real strength here or reason to pursue her.</Comment>

<Comment>PhD to be completed in &apos;09.  4 years teaching experience (outside US); statement about teaching philosophy thoughtful.  Seems well prepared in Stats.  Some math publications, but all but 2 were in &apos;01 or earlier.  I personally do not understand her research, but it seems her work has had impact on the field.  Suggest phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Many publications, but none are research-based.  Does have research-focused presentations.  Limited research funding.  Active in professional organizations.  Experienced teacher.  Holds GNP, but all practice listed is FNP.  Honors/Awards lists Post-Doc Fellowship at Pitt, but no other mention made of this in CV.  Suggest we pursue.</Comment>

<Comment>Post-doc work focusing on spirituality.  Very limited teaching experience.  Limited research.  Only 2 publications.  Only 3 papers presented (2 @ national &amp; 1 @ regional conferences), but has 5 posters.  Does not seem very seasoned.  Not unqualified, but not particularly stellar.  Suggest we hold.</Comment>

<Comment>Only degree in Nursing is BSN.  Accomplished, funded scholar with clear program of research.  Extensive publications, especially of her research.  But … No significant research awards.  No funding since &apos;05 (though has received more than $3M in funding in the past).  No mention of doctoral dissertations advised.  No involvement on NIH or other national review panels since &apos;99.  Only 19 presentations since &apos;98, 6 at Nicotine/ Tobacco conference &amp; 5 at Reversal Theory conference.  Though she headed up the Nursing Education program, she is not an education scholar.  Have some concerns but suggest we do phone interview.</Comment>

AMIA abstracts published.  CV indicates some gaps: limited teaching experience, limited presentations, 2 publications other than AMIA abstracts (&apos;06 &amp; &apos;07) &amp; 3 in review or in press.  Cover letter vague and not too informative.</Comment>

No significant publications.  Some presentations regarding technology, but nothing major.  Selected as HITS scholar, which was highly competitive.  Small amounts of funding for dissertation, but nothing more significant (which is surprising, given the focus on technology).  Active in professional organizations.

Indicates he has consulted on many statistical projects, but does not describe his role.  Many short-term appointments  …  How serious is he about a longer-term commitment at DUSON?  Interesting international experience.  Seems to have potential.</Comment>

Excellent teaching experience; an atypical amount  of teaching as a doctoral student. Believe she has outstanding potential and commitment to research in DM and care giving. Would hate to see her dreams of becoming an accomplished researcher compromised because of inadequate committed mentoring resources. (See details of telephone conversation)</Comment>

<Comment>Certainly seems to be well-prepared in Informatics … 2 post-docs (NYU &amp; NIH), MS in Information Systems, &amp; extensive experience developing and managing information systems.  Most work appointments are very short (4 are 1 year, 3 are 2 years, 1 is 4 years, &amp; 1 is 5 years) … would have liked to see some explanation of these short tenures.  Unable to judge publications fully (since very limited information is provided about each), but I would assume that if they were scholarly in nature, all the info would be there.  Suggest we call references and then pursue if feedback is positive.</Comment>

<Comment>On Friday, February 13th I talked on the phone with Dr. O&apos;Connell.  WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN A POSITION? .. a place that allows me to collaborate with people on research … opportunities for that exist where I am now, but they have not been plentiful as of late … I&apos;m interested in teaching (especially research methods and at the MSN level [though NOT clinical] .. my background is in health behavior, health promotion, disease prevention) … I want to be with nursing colleagues more and be someplace where health and nursing are priorities (which is not the case here) … I am not desperate to leave but would welcome other opportunities.  WHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING AND DISSERTATION ADVISEMENT?  I&apos;ve taught health psychology, health policy (mostly as a colloquium rather than a course), determinants of health behavior, health disparities (again, as a colloquium), and research methods (across health education, nutrition and nursing) … I have 10 students at various stages of their dissertation now &amp; 4 others are getting close … I also advised dissertations while at KU … the topics of those studies are/were illness representation, smoking cessation, quality of life of siblings of children with chronic illness, insomnia, etc.  … I have done no translational work, though I am consulting at a hospital on Long Island about nursing research.  TELL ME ABOUT THE STATUS OF YOUR FUNDING … I was not sure where I wanted to go with smoking and while on sabbatical decided to change to health habits … wrote a proposal in &apos;07 for NIH but they did not think I had enough pilot data for funding (though their comments on the proposal were positive) … I&apos;m now applying Pavlovian conditioning to studying urinary incontinence (with an NP) and have a proposal under review now for an R21 … I&apos;m currently working with colleagues &quot;uptown&quot; (that&apos;s Columbia University Medical Center, where MDs and NPs are educated) on a smoking cessation project … I&apos;m also working with a urologist on a project related to overactive bladders.  OTHER … She asked me about living in the area and told me they have not had a car for years … I don&apos;t know how much difference that would make for her.  RECOMMENDATION … She seemed to be a bit &quot;scattered&quot; about her research, but I got the sense that she was trying to find a new passion.  She is quite accomplished as a researcher, dissertation advisor, and mentor, and I recommend we bring her in for an interview.</Comment>

<Comment>I talked with Jim Turley on Friday 2/27. 

What are you looking for in a position? 

Jim is happy where is he is but likes doing the start up work involved in new or expanding programs. He believes he has an ability to help existing programs rethink what they are doing and with his awareness of our program thinks we could help us evolve into an interdisciplinary program with connections across the campus. 

Can you talk about teaching and dissertation advisement?

Jim designed the informatics program at UT Houston, School of Health Information Sciences. The program only enrolls graduate, MSN, PhD students in nursing and other health related fields. Currently he teaches a couple of the informatics courses, evaluation of health systems and data management. He currently advises 4 doctoral students (chairs 2 committees and on 2 others) and works with a number of MSN students. Doctoral students write 3 publishable papers (conceptual, methods, and data driven) as part of their doctoral requirement. His reputation among students is one of “tough” and “conceptual”. All MSN students complete a synthesis of the literature for their final project that is a publishable paper (40-60% are published).

Tell me about the status of your funding?

No current funding. He expects AHRQ to release RFA as part of stimulus package and he will apply for 1 project as PI and will be on the project of another colleague. Talked with a great deal of excitement about his proposed work with ED physicians and nurses and the external representation of data using Dashboard.

Overall impression. Good interpersonal skills, interested in learning more about opportunities at Duke. Has explored our website and has talked with Constance about our program and school. Was aware of the work that Linda Goodwin had done. I believe he could add a great deal to our informatics program.</Comment>

<Comment>These comments are based on a telephone conversation with Lisa Skemp on 3/14/09
Dr. Skemp has been seeking a position where (1) the University/SON has a priority in globalization; (2) a good fit with her interest in geriatrics and informatics; (3) interest in the Caribbean; and (4) a good match in her research interests. While she feels very supported at Iowa, she was divorced a year ago, living in transitional housing, and feels this is the time for her to either relocate or purchase a house. She is an ethographic field based researcher who enjoys working at the community level. She has  worked  in St. Lucia  for 10 years and based on community needs, is blending a program of capacity building among currently practicing nurses, research designs to pilot her work in gerontology and cultural congruence. She is also looking at ways through the Global Health campus at Iowa and a less technologically sophisticated system, the Global Health Network,  to create access to nursing information among technologically poor countries (She has a project in the Sudan).  She is interested in the least developed countries as well as those making substantial progress, such as the Caribbean. She defines her work as cutting edge.  I was very impressed with her research and capacity building  work, compassion, productivity, focus on model development, familiarity with some of our faculty in geriatrics, and the considerable synergy between OGACHI and her interest. I asked if she would come for a visit if an invitation was extended. Hers was an enthusiastic YES…but she cautioned that she is being courted by other places and she is at the point of being ready for a move. She would like to relocate in time for the fall, 2009 semester.</Comment>

<Comment>Mr. Tarriman has completed all course work towards is PhD and is now at the dissertation phase. His project has been approved and he expects IRB approval in April. He will coduct a mixed methods study of patients with multiple myeloma and their health care providers. Dr. Donna Barry (now at the Dana Farber )is his Chair and he has had support from an Institutional T32. Mr. Tarriman has had a 17 year career focused on clinical practice and had served in various roles in the Oncology Nursing Society. His numerous publications are clinically focused and he now wants to move to the role of nurse scientist and faculty member. His teaching experience dates back to the early/mid 90&apos;s with BSN students in the Phillappeans, but he has practiced as a RN in the US. I found him to be engaging and he asked excellent questions. I&apos;ve asked that he keep us updated about his progress. He hopes to finish 12/09.</Comment>

<Comment>Summary of References on Lisa Skemp based on telephone conversations with Melanie Dreher, Kittie Buckwalter, and Meridean Maas:

All concur that this is a good time for Lisa to consider leaving Iowa: (1) she wishes to be at an institution with a commitment to global health  (such is not the case at Iowa); (2) she recently went through a divorce and is now ready to move on with her life. &quot;A new start will be good&quot;. All see her as an exceptionally bright and gifted person with a great deal of enthusiasm and interest in ethnographic research; an excellent teacher; and committed to community as the setting for  her scholarship. She is a qualitative researcher and engaged in some very exciting work blending her passions of informatics and aging.  She is committed to her on-going work in St. Lucia, which is valued by government and higher education on the island.  She also has projects with ethnic populations in Iowa. She has received modest funding for her work, most from internal sources. She did submit a large NIH grant but it was not funded. She is well published. One person asked that we take note of  the slow down in scholarly  productivity over the past year or so and that we understand  it was related to a particularly uncomfortable divorce. One other person described her as &quot;exceptionally conceptual,&quot; and thought at one point she had a hard time translating the conceptual to a functional level…this also posed problems of understanding by others. However, she felt she has gotten much better in this area.  It was noted that she is the newest Associate Professor at Iowa, and would benefit from working with others.  She was described as hard working. All gave her a very strong endorsement and hope that the she will be considered favorably  by Duke.</Comment>

<Comment>This applicant has a relevant degree and related experience beyond Blackboard on-line teaching. I think she is worth a telephone interview. A question to ask would be her experience with Second Life and some of the gaming simulations that teach decision-making plus, can she develop Web apps? A  and education.</Comment>

<Comment>I am enthusiatic about this candidate for ABSN. He has experience, publications and his pre-doc funding indicates he can do quality research. His inquiry letter was thoughtful. However, of I would recommend we not offer him anything until he DOES complete the PhD.</Comment>

<Comment>Central Florida is not know for its scholars but rather for its&apos; clinical teaching faculty. However this applicant&apos;s CV has some good experience and a number of publications (the pharm content suggests she could add to the ABSN program). Suggest telephone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant has good credentials but not necessarily for a TI Director. Why is is she interested in re-locating? .Her CV does suggest a bit of a job hop for the past few years…..If she is visiting our VA, we could combine a preliminary interview but I would not set her up for a &quot;formal&quot; interview until se get a sense of the nature and scope of her background and her transfer rationale.</Comment>

<Comment>04/08/09  Great management experience, including long-range planning and team development to achieve &quot;bold&quot; goals.  PhD in and work related to human factors psychology would seem to be valuable in the DAST position.  Also, PhD and work related to service systems (including education) gives him credibility, as do his consistent publications, presentations, and patents.  Initially, the CV made him sound kind of &quot;techy,&quot; but overall it seemed to present a viable candidate.  Suggest we consider him seriously if the position still exists and it&apos;s clear that what he has to offer is still what DUSON wants.</Comment>

<Comment>PNP since 2001, though practice experience since then is unclear.  DNS since 2005.  Several years teaching at university level; variety of courses taught (Peds, sociocultural variations in health, research).  Describes self as a good teacher.  Current research interest adolescents with diabetes.  Interests in theory development and instrument development can be helpful.  One publication/year (2005-08), but all in solid journals.  Several national (and more local/regional) poster and paper presentations … all related to her areas of interest/teaching.  Limited funding, though continues to submit.  Letter generally well-written.  A viable candidate for ABSN teaching … pursue.</Comment>

<Comment>Our files indicate she has applied for a researcher position.  If so, I do not see her as qualified for that.  She will earn her PhD next month, and has had an MSN only for 3 years.  Areas of focus at and after MSN are interesting and valuable (e.g., application of innovative technologies to nursing education and clinical care), and she has some experience coordinating clinical trials for drug companies.  But I do not see solid research or academic experience.  Her work at Central Florida was PT for 1 semester, she is not the first author on any publications listed, and she has no grants funded or under review.  Thus, considering her for a researcher position does not seem warranted.  I&apos;m not even sure she brings a great deal of strength for teaching in the ABSN program.  I do not recommend pursuing this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Has applied for researcher position, but I have concerns about that.  Indicates &quot;more than 25 research articles in nursing journals,&quot; but I have no idea of the quality, rigor, or scholarliness of all but 1 of them (J of Advanced Nursing, in which she had a concept analysis published, not a research study).  My lack of knowledge of Chinese journals doe not mean her contributions are not valuable; it&apos;s just an unknown to me.  She has yet to complete her PhD or be licensed as an RN in the US.  Obviously, then, she has not practiced in the US, so I wonder about the extent to which she has sophisticated understanding of health care needs and practices to provide leadership as a researcher into such topics.  Only teaching experience is as a TA, though she has gotten awards for teaching and research assistant work.  Only 2 presentations (both in China).  Only 3 conferences attended, and none seem directly related to her area of expertise.  Small grants received, again all in China. While someone with this kind of diverse background could be a wonderful asset to our faculty, I do not see that this candidate has the qualifications for a researcher position and do not recommend further pursuit.</Comment>

<Comment>Do not see her as a strong candidate for a researcher position.  Titles of publications suggest some are research-based, but it&apos;s hard to be certain; journals are reputable; 1 publication in 2008, 1 in 2007, 2 in 2006, 2 in 2004 … not a very strong record.  Presentations all focus on heart failure (which reinforces her area of expertise); several at major national conferences; no national presentations in 2008, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2006 .. again, not a very strong record.  PI on 1 small study, Co-PI on 2 others (1 at 5% only); RO1 revised and resubmitted in 11/07, but no further work on that; other funding relatively small … not impressive for a researcher position.  Has 5 years teaching experience and seems to be clinically focused, which may make her a viable candidate for ABSN teaching.  Do not recommend for researcher position</Comment>

<Comment>PhD to be completed in 2010.  MSN since 1999.  Has taught 8 years at BSN level and 13 years at ADN level.  No evidence as practice as an ANP, though completed MSN in 1999 and certified in 2006.  Has taught a variety of subjects and has taught online, both of which speak well to her flexibility and continued growth.  Involved on school/college committees to some extent.  Limited scholarly activities.  No cover letter, so unable to know what her goals/interests are, or how well she expresses herself in writing.  May be a candidate for ABSN teaching, but wonder about the impact on PhD completion if she moves and starts a new job.</Comment>

<Comment>I must admit that I&apos;m not sure what the best qualifications are for a TI Director, so I may be off the mark here.  My review of her CV shows an amazingly accomplished individual between 1993 and 2005, after which her contributions decrease.  She left 3 different tenured positions (most unusual) and an endowed professorship (also quite unusual), and except for 7 years at UTHSC and 5 at Case, her appointments have been only 1-2 years each (which always concerns me).  Does have extensive teaching/faculty experience, including teaching a variety of courses, being involved in school/college committees, and advising dissertations … all of which are strengths, but not necessarily for the TI???  Recent reserrch positions in health care facilities have potential for excellent work related to translation, but this is not made clear in her material.  Many research-based publications in reputable journals, with a fairly solid, continuous record.  Extensive list of publications in proceedings/abstracts does not match presentations (which I would expect to be the case); if anything, there would be more publications since many confernces do not publish proceedings, but she has many fewer presentations.  In fact, there are no presentations listed since 2005.  As noted, publications in proceedings/abstracts that are research focused are much fewer in number in more recent years.  Had NINI funding 1997-2004, then nothing in 2005, and only several small grants since 2006; largest grant since 2006 ($125K) focused on community violence … a significant problem, but not at all aligned with prior or subsequent research foci.  Involved professionally and consults internationally.  Experience as coordinator for Taiwan WHO Collaborating Center through Case Western sounds valuable, but I&apos;m not sure of the Taiwan/Case Western relationship in this.  I share Linda&apos;s questions about why the move and why now, and while she has strengths, I wonder if she is a very strong candidate for the TI position.</Comment>

<Comment>Seems like a stong candidate for the OGACHI position … global experiences/work/ commitment, focus on gerontology and community health, development of evidence-based protocols, etc.  Extended teaching experience at Iowa, teaching BSN, MSN, and some PhD courses, as well as supervising student scholarly projects and dissertation.  Consistent record of scholarly publications, though none in 2008.  Consistent internal funding … small amounts but focused.  Only 2 extramural funding projects since PhD … Hartford and Wellmark Foundations.  Surprisingly, no international presentations since 2006, only 1 national presentation in 2008, and most other professional presentations at regional confernces (i.e., MNRS).  I would expect more from an experienced, senior faculty member.  Active in professional associations and contributing to the profession.  Would seem to bring many strengths to OGACHI and its efforts.  Suggest serious pursuit.</Comment>

<Comment>I think this is a very strong cadidate for the DAST position.  Her educational preparation is in education, training and development; her dissertation and master&apos;s capstone focused on educational technologies, and she has preparation in library science, making her a valuable asset for finding resources.  She has taught a graduate online course only once, but it was in instructionalm design and development … very applicable to DAST responsibilities.  Several national presentations, but almost all are at the same conference each year (Academy of Human Resource Development International Research Conference).  Only 1 refereed publication, but it does relate to educational technology; since she is not in an academic/faculty position, publications may not be expected.  Experience working with faculty to write grants and develop educational/ tools, developing student orientation (including online) program, and evaluating emerging technologies for teaching (a major role of DAST, as I understand it).  Would strongly recommend follow up with this candidate, if the DAST position still exists.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate with good potential for ABSN program.  Limited and &quot;old&quot; teaching experience (1992-1995) in Phillipines.  Certified as ANP but now practices as staff RN in Oncology, where he holds certification.  Status of PhD completion unclear .. p. 1 suggests 2008 but p. 8 indicates dissertation starting in Winter 2009.  Continuous record of publications in reputable journals, NINR pre-doc fellowship a strength, and extensive pharmaceutical research activities (his role in all these studies unclear).  Several international presentations; national mostly at ONS annual congress.  Involved in professional contribution activities (e.g., journal reviewer).  Unable to speak to goals since there is no letter.  Consider as a possible candidate once PhD is completed.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate has extensive teaching experience with pre-licensure students, has taught a variety of courses, and has received several teaching excellence awards.  Limited scholarly activities … no refereed publications, no national presentations, no grants … but this may be due to her being a new PhD and having been in academic environments that do not expect or necessarily reward such activities.  Active professionally and in the community.  I think this candidate has the potential to contribute significantly to the teaching endeavor in the ABSN program and most likely could develop her scholarly contributions in an environment that provides collegial support for that.  While she may not be the strongest candidate, I would not &quot;write her off&quot; just yet.</Comment>

<Comment>Letter from this candidate outlines extensive experience with clinical trials, etc.  However, CV does not show the same thing.  She indicates her role at NCI is as a PNP … says nothing about managing clinical trials.  All the research listed ends in 2002.  More &quot;active&quot; publications end in 2003, followed by 1 &quot;pending&quot; and 1 not specified as to status.  7 years teaching at community college level; 2 at U Maryland; 5 years as adjunct in PNP program .. no evidence of having taught anything that comes close to CRM or even research.  I have reservations about this candidate and do not really recommend pursuit.</Comment>

Recognized nationally by peers, editorial boards, consultation, papers presented etc.  Research is alsp progressive with a number of smaller grants ($1,000-9,000)  and a number as Co-PI. Currently, two NIH grants in review, one R0-3 where she is PI, and Co-PI on an R0-1 with L.Davis. Good list of pubs (most with collaborators) with several current 2009 pubs accepted and/or under review. She is a CNS who is actively engaged in staff nursing quality improvement projects. Would be an excellent faculty member; will have to determine how to manage the many projects in which she is engaged. Should continue to next step.</Comment>

<Comment>Several concerns regarding a position as TI Director: (1) concerned about the number of position changes within the same city (Houston) after one or two years of employment. Once gave up a tenured Professor position for an Associate Professor position. This seems unusual.; (2) agree that she has done a lot of research, most related to pediatrics…and much of a translational nature; however, not seeing much related to a director or management position of an institute. I wonder what would conversations with references tell us?</Comment>

<Comment>Will complete PhD in May, 2009. Hence, will be a junior researcher requiring mentoring and guidance. Area of research : geriatrics and skills nursing homes…making her fit with other researchers here. Also says that her PhD will prepare for leadership in applying innovative technologies to nursing education and adv. practice. Seems to have a strength as an educator resulting from academic and TA experience. Unless she has outstanding synergy with current nurse researchers  and we have interest and capacity to mentor, she may not be a viable candidate at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate is 4 years post completion of DNS. Is changing research focus to kids with diabetes. Has beginning scholarship and has identified that she wants to move to research intensive school. I believe Deb has talked with her and checked references. I think we could recommend a visit.</Comment>

I see CG wanted to hold until after Nancy Wood&apos;s visit. Maybe time to have a conversation with Catherine about current thing regarding Director Translational Intistitue?</Comment>

If yes, then the search committee needs direction to evaluate candidates.  This is a very interesting candididate that warrents futher attention if we are still searching for the current job description.</Comment>

I would support her application and think that DUSON would be lucky to have her.  She could easily support the DNP program now and is also capable of asssiting with PhD students.</Comment>

<Comment>Telephone Interview:
Terry Ward is essentially, a  new PhD who received her degree in December, 2009. Her areas of expertise include Med-Surg, Oncology, Orthopedics, and Psych. She describes herself as able to teach across an under graduate curriculum.  Over the 10 years since she has been at Watts, her assignments seem to indicate the same. She has done classroom and clinical teaching for five years before assuming several increasingly responsible admiinstrative positions, including curriculum coordinator. Currently, she is acting program chair.  Our conversation reflected great passion for nursing education, assisting students to think critically, and being a role model for students. She discussed curriculum with a  clear understanding of the  theory base and process of curriculum development. She is an instructor for Kaplan, which adds to her effectiveness as a teacher with the ability to facilitate problem solving, analysis, and synthesis. She does not have a formal degree in Psychiatric Nursing, but came to teach it in the absence of anyone else and grew to enjoy the discipline. Thus, the focus of her doctoral dissertation on the &quot;lived experiences of  adults  with bi-polar disorders.&quot; She has one referred publication and one grant funded out of three submissions. While she wants to continue to develop her research interest based on her dissertation, she realizes that her greater passion is to do educational research, as she sees herself foremost as an educator. Her goals are to teach at the BSN or MSN levels and to contribute to the discipline of  nursing education through research and publications.</Comment>

<Comment>Strong cadidate … based solely on her CV.  (I&apos;ve heard many faculty talk positively about her, but I do not know her.  I know only what&apos;s on paper.)  Clearly an accomplished clinician, recognized (through honors, international work, and consultations) for her expertise.  Involved professionally.  Consistent funding, all of which focuses on her specific area … many grants are small, but she is a co-PI on an RO1 and a PI on an RO3.  Extensive presentations in many forums; again, focused on a consistent area of clinical practice and scholarship.  Knows DUSON.  Suggest we move to next steps in the process.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not see this candidate as viable for a Researcher position, though there is some potential for the ABSN program.  My concerns regarding the Researcher position are … PhD will not be completed until after defense, which is planned for Fall 2009 … research and scholarly activities are limited, with no clear focus or program of research emerging … no funding or even any indication of grant submissions … no publications though 2 are in process … no national presentations, only local/regional … involved actively in only one professional association (NCLN Executive Board), though does serve as a reviewer.  For the ABSN position … 4 years teaching in a community college and 7 at Gardner-webb … taught a variety of courses … involved in the work of the academic institutions where she works.  Overall … do NOT recommend for research position, but may consider for ABSN when PhD is completed.</Comment>

<Comment>Objective stated on her resume indicates she wants a joint appointment-type arrangement.  Can we offer that?  Has practiced as an FNP for nearly 2 years, though has been certified for 7.  Has taught in BSN program for 6 years.  Rural interest may be helpful to us.  Member of several professional associations, but no significant involvement.  Research completed relates only to MSN and DNP requirements … nothing more.  No publications or presentations.  Letter is vague.  I do NOT recommend we pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>A surprisingly weak resume for someone who has held the PhD for 12 years, who has been in academe for more than 30 years, and who holds the rank of Professor.  Has had varied teaching responsibilities over her 3 years at Duquesne and approximately 30 years at Indiana U of PA … speaks to her versatility.  Limited number of grants, all of which are small and none of which have been awarded since 2005 … also, no publications are noted as an outcome of any of these grant-supported projects.  No research since 1998.  Regional and national presentations, focusing primarily on education, which is her area of expertise.  No workshops presented since 2004.  Membership, but no involvement or leadership roles in professional associations.  Does continue her own learning and has received an award for significant service to her SON and university, which is extensive.  It is not clear why she is moving to this area or what she is seeking in a position.  Despite having the PhD and extensive teaching experience, she does not excite me as a candidate we should pursue vigorously.</Comment>

<Comment>An interesting candidate, but not one of the strongest across the board.  PhD to be completed this month … focus is health leadership.  MSN also was in administration (nursing).  Certificate in Gerontology, but does not indicate this is ANCC .. I am not familiar with the postgrad certificate from NYU, though I do know they are a Hartford Center and a leading one at that.  Has taught for 6 years, but all in small &quot;stints&quot; … 3 at Seton Hall (NJ), then 2 at Southern CT State (CT), now 1 at SUNY New Paltz (NY).  His letter gives no indication of why all the moves.  This concerns me.  Also teaches as an adjunct at another school while holding a (presumably) FT position in 2 places … how does one do this and do one&apos;s FT job well, particularly at the beginning of one&apos;s academic career?  On the other hand, he has taught varied and interesting courses, taught diverse student populations, and is involved in important activities at SUNY, despite being there for only 1 year.  He is beginning to publish, but shows no clear focus in his writings.  Limited involvement in professional associations.  No grants noted or even grants submitted.  No research noted.  Several presentations at local and national conferences, but (again) they are &quot;all over the place&quot;  …  men in nursing, obesity, ASA toxicity, business, education, delegation to UAPs, etc.  He seems scattered in his scholarly work and in his work history.  This concerns me, and I am not inclined to pursue him … however, I suppose I can be convinced otherwise.</Comment>

<Comment>I spoke with Dr. Wise again on 4-16.  After talking about both of the pediatric faculty position options she was very interested in the ABSN position.  She was originally under the impression that the ABSN position was more of a CI position.  Her long term goal is to be able to teach, practice, and engage in research.  While she had anticipated that she would be able to do some research in her current position, her clinical time commitment and her 45 minute commute one way makes this impractical.  She has taught previously in a clinical role primarily.  Dr. Docherty has observed the candidate at national meetings and sees the candidate as involved at the national level in her profession. Dr. Wise emailed me after our conversation and speaking with her husband and will submit a revised CV and cover letter for the ABSN position.</Comment>

<Comment>New DNP graduate.  Area of focus is cardiovascular.  This candidate brings up an interesting question that needs to be put forward to administration.  What mix of DNP-PhD faculty do we desire, or is it what mix of clinical vs. tenure track faculty are we seeking.  In other words research focus vs. clinical focus.  Some DNP faculty may end up with a research program, but it is not clear to me what criteria we should be using.  Let&apos;s discuss tomorrow.</Comment>

<Comment>I have talked with him and can clarify a few things. He has completed his PhD (Dec). His movement from the first 2 schools was because the appointments were term appointments and he chose not to renew due to long distance commutes. His current school announced last month that they will close the nursing program at the end of the 2010 academic year. I would ask that he get a call, not from me, but from a committee member. ABSN program is looking for adult/gero faculty.</Comment>

<Comment>The applicant will defend PhD in fall, 2009. Her area of specialization at the MSN level is Nursing Education, yet the research that she has done (breast cancer) is not in NE, which I find interesting. She has taught in associate degree and RN to BSN programs since 1997. She has a variety of experiences as an educator, but limited in the level of scholarly endeavors by the type of instituions where she has worked. Thus, she does not present like most research applicants (even those who are new PhDs). I think she is better considered as faculty for the ABSN program.</Comment>

<Comment>Spoke with Scott this morning for a preliminary interview.  (1) Asked about his short-term appointments at so many schools … He indicated these were all 1-year term appointments, as he did not have the PhD in hand and was not eligible for tenure track.  Worked at Seton Hall x 3 years while finishing PhD coursework there, then went to Southern CT (which was a bit closer to home).  Had hoped for a continued appointment there, but they were &quot;slow&quot; in making those appointments and in the meantime, he found the tenure track position at New Paltz.  Enjoys that work (RN/BSN program) and would not be thinking of leaving yet, but that program will close in spring 2010, so he is exploring other options.  (2)  Asked about his strengths as a faculty member &amp; greatest contributions he could make to DUSON … He noted that he has taught many different courses (BSN &amp; MSN) and feels comfortable with and likes that kind of flexibility.  Enjoys the challenge of teaching accelerated program students.  Describes himself as versatile and &quot;likes to do a lot of different things.&quot;  Currently practicing as a GNP which enhances his teaching.  He did not really speak to the contributions he could make.  (3)  Asked about his seemingly &quot;scattered&quot; focus (men in nursing, obesity, delegation, ASA toxicity, etc.) and what he sees as his primary area(s) of focus .. Said he is currently doing a secondary analysis of the LOADS of data from his dissertation (which was exploratory) and expects to continue that focus on leadership, delegation, role implementation, etc.  Also interested in educational practices and studying the effect of different approaches.  Did not articulate any specific plans RE publishing, grants, etc., but I did not pursue that question with him.  Did say that from looking at our website, he thought his interests aligned most closely with Ruth Anderson &amp; Kristen Corrazzini and he would like to meet with them if he comes here for a visit to talk with them about common interests.  (4)  Asked about his current practice as a GNP, which was mentioned in his letter but not on his CV … Said this is a private practice of him, a Psych NP &amp; a Social Worker, who work in a private-pay community and give support and guidance to elderly who may need help with placements or community resources, may need to be assessed and referred to an MD, etc.  He said it&apos;s a small practice that is somewhat &quot;informal&quot; &amp; that&apos;s why he did not put it on his CV.  (5)  Asked about references … He will send a list of references to Crystal.  (6)  Asked if he had any questions of me … &quot;No.&quot;  Said he has looked through our website &amp; talked with John Brion &amp; has no specific questions at this point.  (7)  Overall, Scott seemed quite personable, self-confident, flexible, and knowledgeable of teaching &amp; educational issues.  I recommend we move to next steps with him.</Comment>

<Comment>Colleagues, I scanned his CV again and then read the comments. He does not seem to fit our &quot;best of the best&quot; expectation for today&apos;s situations. However, he would be a new grad and might make a creditable clinical faculty....

No actual teaching experience in academia, but was in charge of new GN orientation in health department, which she enjoyed.

<Comment>Not sure applicant would be suitable for any employment at this time. Her MSN is in Administration and Education; her current work is as Employee Health Coordinator, at a hospital,  and she has been teaching (clinical instructor) in  Community Health for two years. Do not see the synergy among these three. Also, has very little clinical practice. I would not consider.</Comment>

Worked on projects dealing with animal-assisted programs and stress ; spirituality and HIV-AIDS; and HIV-AIDS and stress. Post-doc work on feasibility and effect of novel centering on stress in adults in adults with HIV-AIDS. Several manuscripts under development or in review. Could be interesting to find out more about her and how she might fit in DUSON. Could possible expand # faculty  researchers focused on HIV-AIDS. Work in East Africa might have a relationship with MR. Worthy of further consideration.</Comment>

I thought from quick CV review that her work in heart failure might help to build more CV capacity in DUSON. Good number of pubs (probably refereed and non-refreed) and experience and post doc training at Emory. Don&apos;t know what telephone interview revealed, but short or anything bad, I would keep her in an active file for future consideration for an interview in the event a position opens.</Comment>

Wants to do research and would be a good match for our Community Based research efforts at Duke.  I think we should persue her.  Given her background and community research interestes I would recommend Dorothy follow up with her references, all of whom are excellent.  7 pubs, 3 first authored and one under review. Good research potential and tenure track candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>List indicates she is pursuing a Researcher position … I do not see it.  Since completing PhD in 2006 has worked as a Clinical Assistant Instructor … rather low level of appointment.  RA/TA for 2 years while doing PhD and has a few small grants, but nothing indicates she has the potential for significant research funding or contributions.  Also … in all honesty, I think that anyone who submits a CV without a cover letter that (a) speaks to her/his strengths and potential contributions to DUSON,and (b) outlines her/his achievements/accomplishments to date conveys a lack of sophistication or a lack of real interest in the position, and I am concerned about such candidates.  Bottom line … do NOT pursue for a researcher position.</Comment>

<Comment>Letter indicates she is applying for a researcher position, but I do not see her as being qualified for that.  While she has several years&apos; experience as a research associate and is completing a post-doc at VCU, I do not see enough of a history of scholarly work to consider her for a researcher position.  She lists 7 publications/presentations … 3 are under review, 1 is her dissertation in UMI, 2 are posters, and 1 is a paper presented at a local clinic.  Her preparation in Divinity and experience in East Africa, along with her 2 years of adjunct teaching are interesting, but not enough to warrant pursuit for a researcher position.  I recommend we do NOT pursue.</Comment>

International? Local?) … also most recent one was in October 2007.  Letter does not clarify how she could contribute to the ABSN program.  Not a particularly strong candidate.

<Comment>Dual preparation in Psych and ANP is a plus, as is her experience as an academic.  I do wonder, however, why she is interested in teaching in an ABSN program after teaching graduate students for nearly 10 years???  Clinical experiences are varied.  Letter mentions &quot;my record of funded research,&quot; though what I see is quite limited.  She is completing a post-doc, she has a good track record of publications in respected journals, and the research interest described in her letter is valuable.  I suggest we DO pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>I agree we follow-up. I spoke with her and she is applying for ABSN as that is a position we have open. She declined a position at U or Maryland because she did not want to live in Baltimore and the more I talked with her I had the sense she may be interested in us only as a way to stay in NC. After 45 minutes on the phone, she feels her strenghts would be teaching community health, not psych or adult. I think Dorothy might be the person to follow-up.</Comment>

<Comment>MS in Nursing Education. Has no clinical expertise. So not sure what she would teach. Practice experience in cardiac and hospice primarily. Has some teaching experience at community college level. Would not recommend her for further consideration, due to lack of expertise and little experience since the award of MSN.</Comment>

<Comment>New MSN in Nursing Education. Taught in Curriculum Development and supervised residency in Tanzania. Good student with great enthusiasm for teaching. However, far to inexperienced at this time.Probably, OK for CI but would need to stay focused on objectives. Clinical expertise in ICU and Surgical ICU. Minimal in-service teaching experience. I think could benefit from teaching at another level before consideration for ABSN program.</Comment>

<Comment>This is a new PhD in Public Health with considerable international experience in Tanzania. A Certified Nurse Midwife, working both in US and abroad, Has little to no teaching experience, none of which is clinical and research is limited to dissertation. No pubs, but several manuscripts under development.  I was interested in applicant because of her international experience, competence in both Spanish and Swahili, midwifery, and public health. She is junior and will need mentoring, BUT, I think there is potential that is consistent with growth in global focus. I have met with her. I would recommend someone else to do a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>New DNP; considerable as a PNP in academic setting in role as Director of CPNP program. Practice in Family Clinic and in an Asthma and Allergy Practice. One publication. Grants primarily for equipment; not for any research.I yield to DB, but unless her particular areas of practice experience significantly enhance research already being done by other PNP researchers, there is minimal enthusiasm. Not sure I know specifically what her clinical focus would be if on the clinical track. Overall, low level of interest.</Comment>

<Comment>A most imteresting candidate … teaching nursing in Korea, missionary work in 5 countries, research with Mexican Americans, vulnerable populations focus in PhD program, and post-doc related to spirituality.  Noted areas of interest are interesting and would bring a unique perspective to our community.  Good record of publications, many of which are research-based,  in reputable journals, with 4 manuscripts under review and preparation and 3 others &quot;in press.&quot;  Presented at a wide range of conferences, often to report research findings.  Teaching experiences are limited … most done in Korea in 2007, letter notes having taught a graduate-level course, but where that was done is not clear on the CV.  Is applying for Researcher/International position and indicates ability to teach research and stats courses, which makes sense.  I will defer to Dorothy about her qualifications for this position … while I think she has an interesting background, she is beginning her research career and does not have extensive Caribbean experiences (which is where I thought our priority was).  How important these factors are is something I&apos;d like to hear from Dorothy.  If there is support from Dorothy to pursue her, I would support that.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant has had a long and eclectic career in law, nursing practice and nursing education. From 2001 forward, it seems that applicant may have floated from one service to the other as dates overlap. Dominant areas of practice seem to be the ED and ICU. Most recently served as CI for nursing and paramedic students. Several posts in nursing education are for a short duration. I do not get a sense that this is someone of interest unless references suggest otherwise.</Comment>

<Comment>PhD as Nurse Practitioner; Post Doc in Nursing Informatics in 2005. Applicant has had a rich career that seems to have evolved from NP practice, to NP education including directorship of NP program and UPenn. Interest in informatics is evident through pubs and grants beginning early 2000s. Her focus in infomatics seems to be focused (in terms of work experiences) in consumer projects and in integrating employee health into electronic data base. Has several grants in the area of infomatics including more recent ones funded by CDC (focus on Public Health). This is a strong applicant when taking her entire career into considration and has been mentored, collaborated, and published with highly respected nurse scholars. Do not see specific evidence as a Coordinator of an Informatics Educational Program, but as mentioned, she has evolved over time. Perhaps a phone discussion with some of references might give a better idea of her capability for the position posted.</Comment>

<Comment>This applicant has some interesting accomplishments and experiences that match, in part, some of the research areas of interest for OGACHI.  Strengths include: a PhD in Vulnerable Populations; focus of much of work on home health services and family care givers; and a number of the health issues of the elderly. She has worked with the Mexican American population which is consistent with a  OGACHI agenda item on-hold to help build capacity in care for the elderly in Central America. Her primary targeted population is Korean, an area we have not to date pursued. She seems to have minimal grant writing experience, although was a research assistant on two NIH grants. One first author pub and a couple of others under development. I recommend a conversation with her to get a better sense of match between current work in Caribbean and potentially in Central America with the elderly. Or, some of references could be called.</Comment>

<Comment>A very accomplished IT stratgiest with many attributes consistent with the seeming vision we have for leadership in this area, including experiences in product development, education, large systems development, lesser systems development, and considerably more. Many business and company start up experiences, plus strategic leadership in IT at Duke. Not a nurse (if that is relevant).
Why would someone with this much experience, corporate and institutional savvy and probably high wage earning potential be interested in a singular school and discipline?</Comment>

Cons: No significantly funded research; she states that she has over 15 years of teaching experience, but this is not reflected in her CV; in her cover letter, she doesn’t seem to be choosing academia, but is choosing to move away from New York; there is something we may need to ask about if she interviews for the position.</Comment>

Employment experience is rather eclectic although seems to be greater involvement in cardiac care. Has some teaching in background. Applicant states that he has a strong desire to return to teaching as he continues doctoral study. Not sure what this person would teach in ABSN program.

Engaged in Community Health/Public Health nearly 16 years ago. If we need a Hospice care/EOL faculty, would suggest doing further investigation. However, concern about currency for MHN at ABSN level, Did some public health clininc practice years ado and was the Director of Nursing at a new health center…but some 16 years ago. Publications not related to CHN or Hospice care. Has attracted 5 grants, all small expect one and do pertain to EOL/hospice. Not comfortable from what I see as a CHN faculty member for ABSN program.</Comment>

<Comment>These are updated comments on this applicant after a more indepth review and review of one of her publications:
       1. Has MSN preparation as a community health nurse
       2. Taught community health nursing from 1996-2004 (8 years) 
       3. Service from 1975-1996 was directly related to community health
       4. Her hospice/EOL work is largely community/rural  based. I undertand that the 
           Hospice of the Bluegrass is one of the top hospices in US
       5. Review of her article on Using the Internet for Clinical Teaching reflects two things:
           (a) her adaptedness in the use of the internet  (Web-CT) to aid in teaching of 
             Community Health and Psych is a strength; and (b) the article discusses many 
             venues and strong sites for community health clinical practice, hopice being one.
Of the four referred publications, she is first author on two and she has several small grants and is an investigator on one larger grant.

On re-reviewing her materials, I am more positive that her community health currency is sufficiently strong and current for further consideration. Her passion and currency with hospice, EOL, and pallative care create another potential campus collaboration with the Divinity School.

I support follow up and a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Would seem to be a most viable candidate.  Well prepared in community health, palliative care, and education.  Excellent experience, including 8 years teaching in BSN programs.  Limited publications, &amp; none are recent, but she does have some &amp; most are focused on education/teaching, which would fit with ABSN appointment.  No grants, no research listed (not even dissertation!), and mostly local presentations … though does have 1 national presentation and 2 guest lectures in schools of medicine.  Interesting that only 2009 presentations are listed … does this mean there were none before 2009???  Interest expressed in letter about linking to Divinity School is exciting.  Letter conveys a positive perspective on downsizing that might affect her current work.  Recommend follow up with references.</Comment>

Also has received a teaching excellence award, recognition (by YMCA) as a woman of distinction, and is a faculty member with the National Hospice &amp; Palliative Care Organization … all worthy acknowledgement of her contributions &amp; achievements.</Comment>

<Comment>Excellent candidate we should pursue.  PhD since 1992 &amp; post-doc at Michigan establish her as committed to scholarship.  This is supported by her consistent track record and clear focus of grants (though most are small), peer-reviewed publications, &amp; presentations at international/national/regional conferences.  Actively involved in professional organizations &amp; as a manuscript and abstract reviewer.  Has advised dissertations, been involved in her university, &amp; taught in &amp; coordinated an ABSN-like program.  Finally, she notes that her first love is teaching, she has functional preparation in education from VCU, she has been selected as a distinguished faculty member, &amp; her goal is to establish models of teaching excellence.  Would seem to be a great candidate for the ABSN program, with potential to contribute in many other ways.</Comment>

<Comment>EdD from University of Pheonix and MSN in Nursing Administration from George Mason University. Has an interesting career pattern of teaching simultaneously at several institutions or for relative short periods of time in a variety of institutions. An emphasis in teaching at the Associate Degree level. Her strength is in nursing administration and the use of on-line technology. However, she has taught both OB and Peds, much as a clinical instructor. I was unclear if one of the key areas of expertise we are seeking is nursing administration. If not,  applicant may not have preparation and experience consistent with our stated needs.</Comment>

<Comment>This is a well prepared applicant with strengths in clinical practice and in teaching. Specialty is Critical Care Pediatrics, althought has taught and practiced in other settings such as Med-Surg and some OB (teaching.) Much of teaching is in Review courses and in such cases, has been able to review in multiple generalist disciplines. Taught for six years in BSN program at Marymount College. Has no research and no serious publications. One area of potential concern relates to the absence of primary care and community based settings for pediatric care, a level of focus necessary for ABSN program. She certainly commands an interview and reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Caines was awarded the PhD in 2006 and has had progressive experience as a practitioner and teacher of nursing. Her dissertation was an ethnographic study of swimming among early adolescent girls. Research and clinical practice focus on primary care and community based experiences with the general pediatric population and adolescent health; school based clinics, NP full service clinics. Has functioned in faculty role, including membership on Curriculum Committee. Areas of research interest include youth development, impact of swimming, peds pain and symptom management and had address head and neck cancer. Her community based approach is a good balance  with in-patient peds dominance. Seems to be making good progress as a researcher and scholar: 4 first author referred pubs (one in press) and another pub in review. Minimal grant productivity. Her background seems to be a good match with needs of ABSN curriculum. A phone interview and reference checks recommended</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Jenkins is currently in a temporary position after resigning her position as Coordinator of Consumer Informatics, Primary Care Information Project at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in New York.  She resigned because this position was changing focus from clinical informatics development and evaluation to primarily implementation of a new system in small primary care practices.  She felt this change in focus did not suit her interests which are primarily in evaluation of clinical informatics self management and care coordination systems.  Before leaving the position at the Department of Health she submitted a grant to RWJ to connect patient data collected in the home via blue tooth technology directly to primary care providers.  Nurses would assume the role of managing this data and case work.  It is in this area that she would like to continue her research, but she does not see herself as a tenure track faculty member.  She has taught a variety of coursework at the BSN, MSN, and PhD level.  There is a new attachment in her folder with a list that was not included in her CV.  It is unclear to me the level of her informatics expertise, but she has taught some informatics coursework.  She understood the teaching requirement of a clinical track faculty member and was also advised as to DUSON’s commitment to the interdisciplinary informatics program.  She has worked with Ed. Hammond in AMIA, therefore he may be a source of additional information. She has taught online, has Blackboard experience and has used other technologies such as WebX.  She has a son, daughter-in-law and grandson that live in Durham.  She also would like to continue to keep her licensure as a FNP.</Comment>

<Comment>I agree with Dorothy&apos;s comments.  She has extensive experience with pre-licensure students.  Probably not a tenure track candidate.  Her mentor is someone known to me from UNC&apos;s PhD program and is typically good.  Her pediatric expertise with adolescents would be a nice addition to the pediatric faculty.</Comment>

<Comment>Telephone Interview
Through conversation, Dr. Mueggenburg impressed me as well grounded academically and experientially in community/public health. Her principles, values and theoretical framework for working with community seemed appropriate, relevant, and compatible with the global (international and local) placements we have established.  I was pleased to hear her talk about how to integrate epidemiology, community assessment (comprehensive), community analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation into classroom and clinical.  She appeared to be an engaging teacher and committed to facilitating student growth. She has a healthy respect for communities of various cultural orientations and what nurses do independently and through interdisciplinary arrangements. She has 25 years of experience with refugee resettlement around the world, so understands cultural diversity. She discussed how and why palliative care and end of life were very positive community-based rotations and options. She is also interested in linking with the Institute on End of Life at the Divinity School. She asked questions about research and scholarship and wants to continue her work on palliative care and hospice. I was very impressed. I recommend checking references and if they are OK, invite for a campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Nice cover letter &amp; has some good qualifications -- solid work in C-V nursing, experience in staff development, active organizational involvement as a BSN student, &amp; a presentation at an international conference.  However, his most recent clinical experience was in 2006 &amp; he has no academic teaching experience.  My biggest concern, however, is that he does not hold an MSN.  How could we appoint anyone to a FT position, without at least an MSN.  I understand that he is in a BSN-to-PhD program, but he still does not hold the MSN.  He plans to do his pilot work in 2009-2010, so I would expect that the PhD would not be finished until at least 2011.  I do not think we can or should have someone in a FT position for that long without the MSN, particularly when we have other candidates, and he does not bring anything extraordinary to the position.  My recommendation is NO.</Comment>

<Comment>Earned PhD, active practice as an acute care NP, &amp; teaching experience (including curriculum committee work).  His letter states that he has &quot;dedicated my career to nursing education.&quot;  Sorry, but I do not see it.  It&apos;s true that he was an adjunct at Vcu x 2 years, a CI at ECU x 2 years, &amp; is an Assistant Prof at Barton College (in his 2nd year), but I would hardly call that &quot;dedicating my career to nursing education.&quot;  His career definitely seems to be focused on acute care NP practice, which is quite strong.  I wonder, though, how successful he would be teaching generalist nursing to beginners?  I also see no indication of active involvement in professional associations (though he is a member of several), no research, no publications, &amp; no professional presentations … and this for a person who has had his MSN since 2000 &amp; his PhD since 2006.  While I think he could &quot;do the job,&quot; I do not see him as a particularly strong candidate &amp; would recomment we NOT pursue.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate presents some contradictions to me.  Her stated objective is &quot;to be an active scholar,&quot; yet she conveys a strong commitment to maintaining a practice &amp; to the scholarship of teaching &amp; learning.  All these things can, of course, co-exist, but it comes across to me that she is not sure where her heart &amp; passion lies.  She notes that the PFF course at Minnesota &quot;fostered an affinity for the scholarship of teaching &amp; learning,&quot; yet she has not pursued any pedagogical scholarship, nor has she presented on or published in this vein.  Her CV indicates that she defended her dissertation in 12/06 … are we to assume the degree was awarded in 2007?  She does not say that.  She has good clinical experience and is current in her practice, which is a strength. Nearly all of the publications listed are abstracts … only the last one is a full article, and it&apos;s from 2004, where she was the 4th author.  She does have 2 presentations at respected conferences, and has a total of 8 poster presentations …all focused on her clinical areas of focus.  She lists no membership in or active contributions to professional associations.  Finally, while her teaching philosophy is well done and presents ideas with which I can resonate … and while she has taught in 3 different schools (1 of which was as a &quot;Teaching Specialist,&quot; a title that has no meaning for me … Is it a TA?) … she has not been in any of those positions for very long … 3 years as that Teaching Specialist, 2 at URI, and now 2 at Southern Maine.  She gives no explantion for why she has moved so often and so frequently, or why she wants to move now, after only 2 years.  While I do not see her as an extraordinary candidate, and while I have some questions about her &quot;track record&quot; with faculty positions, I would support follow-up with a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>While I know that the &quot;word&quot; we have gotten from the Dean is that MSN candidates should not automatically be eliminated, I worry about changing our practice &quot;mid-stream,&quot; having donejust that for 10 or more individuals in the past few months.  Having noted that caveat, let me comment on this individual.  Her most recent positions are as a private duty nurse in home care/hospice and on a DUHS clinical research unit … is this current enough and &quot;intense&quot; enough to have her be &quot;up to speed&quot; to teach ABSN students?  She has had experience as a clinical educator &amp; a nursing instructor, but neither of those have been particularly extended experiences.  In fact, the list of positions she has held in her 30-year career seems to show her &quot;jumping around&quot; from position to position, never staying in any one for more than 2 years.  This always worries me.  She is not actively involved in any professional associations, has only 2 publications (1 in 2005 &amp; 1 in 2007, &amp; neither of which sounds particularly scholarly or conveying a strong clinical or teaching focus), has no grants or research, has primarily local presentations (the most recent of which was in 2007), &amp; has not participated in any professional development programs to any great extent (1 in 2007, 1 in 2002, &amp; others were before then).  She is certified, her focus on holistic health and complementary therapies, and community service are all strengths.  I do not see anything exceptional in this candidate and would recommend that we NOT pursue her.</Comment>

<Comment>A most interesting candidate.  Presents herself as qualified for ABSN or Informatics, yet I do not see overwhelming strength in either area.  EdD is from U Phoenix … I do not know about the rigor or quality of that program.  MSN is in nursing administration.  Presents NINE (yes, 9 !!!) pages of &quot;experience&quot; … no position was for more than 2 years until you go back to 1988-1994 when she was a staff nurse in one place for those 6 years.  Again, this always troubles me, especially since there is no pattern to the jobs and no explanation for the short-term appointments.  She notes that she is the &quot;sole proprietor&quot; of a company (I suppose) that provides consultation … I wonder how active that business is, how much of her time it takes, and how it would complement or get in the way of her engaging fully at DUSON.  She does have teaching experience (at the undergrad &amp; graduate levels), but I wonder about how committed she is to any program.  At present, she is on faculty at Mountain State U, Excelsior, U of Phoenix, &amp; Penn State.  Now, I realize this may be an online course in 1 place in 1 semester, &amp; another online course in another place in another semester, but it seems like she wants to do it all and, as a result, does not seem to focus anywhere.  Her &quot;regular&quot; teaching appointments were, again, for only 1 or 2 years at a time.  The information provided about publications does not indicate full citations, so it&apos;s hard to tell what the works are or how significant they might be.  Most of her publications are guides to practice, but they do not seem to be evidence syntheses; the only research-focused &quot;publication&quot; is her dissertation in the ProQuest digital DB.  Additionall, the topics of her publications range from critically ill children, to test taking, to trauma, to the nursing shortage, to risk management, to statistics, to the health care team.  A clear focus does not emerge for me.  Her induction into the Knights of Malta and appointment to the Disaster Medicine Sub-committee of the Society of Critical Care Medicine are interesting, though I have no idea what&apos;s involved in the former or what the impact of the latter was.  The research she lists are her dissertation and (I would assume) MSN thesis and other projects done while a student at George Mason.  Despite the confidence she expresses in her letter, I do not see much strength here and would recommend that we NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Interesting candidate with MA in Psych &amp; PhD in Clinical Psych.  Despite this, however, she seems to identify her &quot;specialty&quot; area as Gero.  Once again, I see a CV that lists 4+ pages of jobs … none being longer than 2 years, &amp; the most recent being only 3 months.  The exception is a 6-year role as CNS back in 1993-1999.  And again, there is no explanation of all the &quot;jumping around.&quot;  Seems to have current clinical practice experience (as a CNS &amp; as a manager/director, &amp; did develop a new role of e-learning consultant which she held for 1 year with Kaiser.  Directed staff development department in CA for 1 year &amp; was a corporate education specialist at a VNA for 1 year, but has had no academic teaching experience.  Her master&apos;s, however, did focus on education &amp; prepare graduates for a faculty role.  She indicates no involvement in professional organizations, no presentations, no grants, and only sketchy information about &quot;publications,&quot; most of which are difficult to evaluate.  By the way, she lists an online CE course through Western Schools of Nursing that has the exact same title as the leadership book I&apos;ve co-authored -- &quot;The New Leadership Challenge in Nursing&quot; -- but I could find no information about this course.  Finally, I was overwhelmed by the list of &quot;areas of interest &amp; focus for research&quot; (p. 7) … it&apos;s &quot;all over the map&quot; and shows no clear focus or passion.  I would not object if the committee recommended phone interviews with this candidate, but at this point, I am not an enthuastic supporter of her candidacy.</Comment>

<Comment>Seems to be a strong candidate, though I agree with Constance&apos;s comment that &quot;she does not seem to be choosing academe, but wanting to move away from her current job&quot; (which sounds like the work will become more &quot;routine&quot; now that they have &quot;turned the corner&quot;).  CV shows a nice (&amp; a consistent) blend of informatics work &amp; clinical practice &amp; teaching.  Her post-doc at Columbia in nursing informatics and her 2001 NLM fellowship in medical informatics are impressive, as is her extensive work in informatics (with the NY Health Department, as co-director of a HRSA-funded project, and as a consultant to many groups/institutions).  She has teaching experience at 4 different schools (for a total of 16 years).  Her clinical experience is current, which keeps her connected to that part of nursing/health care as well as the informatics part.  Good history of publication in significant journals; her most recent journal publication was in 2006, but since then she has been active in publishing scientific abstracts.  None of her book chapters focus on informatics, but her other publications surely do.  She has received honors (and served as a consultant) that attest to her expertise (including invited participation in TIGER initiatives), and she is active in professional organizations.  Finally, her international  experiences (New Zealand, UK, Ireland, France, &amp; Greece) bring a broadened perspective to what she could bring to DUSON.  I strongly recommend phone interviews and (if all goes well there) a visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Although this candidate has been a nurse for 35 years, she provides no evidence of significant personal or professional growth.  Her clinical work, though extensive, seems to have been primarily at the staff nurse level, and while she may be an excellent bedside clinician, I question whether that is broad/extensive enough to qualify her for a FT faculty position.  Her entire career has been in PA, but she gives no indication of why she is exploring DUSON &amp; (apparently) ready to leave PA now.  Her letter says that she taught RN/BSN students at Penn State, yet her CV says she was in the CE department there; teaching CE courses is a bit different from teaching academic courses.  Her teaching is, essentially, non-existent, she has had no involvement in professional organizations, no publications/presentations/grants, and no indication of any kind of scholarly endeavors.  I would NOT recommend this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>I must say this candidate&apos;s CV was somewhat of a mystery to me, as there were no dates provided, nor was it clear what her current position(s) are all about.  As I reviewed her positions, I did not see any current clinical practice, yet her letter says she is certified in Adult Psych/Mental Health.  Where is the practice she talks about in her letter (e.g., &quot;Alzheimer&apos;s screening programs &amp; family &amp; patient education&quot;), and how does she manage to maintain certification?  She is a DNP candidate in Public Health Leadership, a program she entered &quot;with the express wish to return to teaching&quot; … yet it&apos;s unclear how a DNP program, particularly one with her focus, prepares one for a teaching role.  She has received some nice recognition for her achievements and engages in community service, but she has no involvement in professional organizations, no professional presentations, and no grants or research.  Her only scholarly work is a list of publications, but the most recent of these were in 2006 and 1997, and the 2006 one (&amp; several others) are in a journal I know nothing about (Psychiatric Services) and cannot anticipate the impact of her writing.  I really do not see much in this CV that leads me to suggest we pursue this candidate, so I would recommend we NOT pursue.</Comment>

<Comment>Seasoned Academic with strong credentials and long list of notable accomplishments in education, research, and service to the profession. Completed a post doc in 2003 in Neuroscience/Neurobiology. Has taught in higher education for 17 years and as best I can tell, most of the teaching has been in Maternal Child areas. Not sure what she taught however during the more recent years at TX and Florida. Has an active research career  between 1997 and 2005, had 13 funded grants as PI, although all were small grants. Currently completing her first R series grant as PI on Vasomotor Symptoms and Blood Glucose in Menopausal Women (R-15). A good number of first author publications in referred journals. Her clinical practice was active from 1976-1994 with progressive levels of responsibility. In 2005, she took a position as a staff nurse on a Women and Infants Unit, no doubt to update her practice. She is certainly an accomplished educator/researcher. Recommend taking her to the next step of review.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate indicates an interest in teaching in the DNP program.  I was not aware we were searching for such individuals, but if we were, I&apos;m not sure I would recommend her for that.  Her clinical experience &amp; expertise is well documented, she holds the earned DNP, she has made presentations at national &amp; international conferencesw, &amp; she has taught for a total of 9 years in an academic enviroment &amp; 13 years with the Elsevier conference -- all of the Elsevier years overlapped with other positions, so I assume that teaching was an &quot;aside,&quot; teaching at some of the pediatric conferences listed in her CV, perhaps.  Finally, she participates in an annual work team that goes to Ecuador to care for children with congenital heart disease (though she provides no dates to indicate how long she has been doing this), &amp; she is fluent in Spanish.  Despite these strengths, however, she has some weaknesses we need to address, particularly for an appointment to teach in the DNP program.  She lists one publication (1993), but it does not sound like a particularly scholarly one.  She lists no involvement in professional organizations, no research, no grants, &amp; no major clinical practice change initiatives resulting from the translation of evidence to practice.  In summary, this candidate sounds like an excellent clinician who shares her clinical expertise, but there is very little else that shows a broadened perspective, which would seem to be essential for teaching, particularly in a DNP program.  There also is no indication of why she wants to leave Walter Reed and move into academe.  I recommend a phone interview with this candidate to ascertain information about the noted limitations &amp; the questions.</Comment>

<Comment>To be honest, I was insulted by this CV.  It surely is padded !!!  She lists jobs as a waitress &amp; a file clerk, &amp; she lists her high school diploma.  Then she lists papers she wrote for her DNP program as publications.  The few &quot;lectures&quot; she has given are all local.  She lists membership in a number of organizations, but is not involved in any of them.  And she lists every CE program she attended, most of which sound like they were at her place of employment (or at an AHA conference).  How can an individual paricipate in 81 CE programs in one year???  Additionally, not one of all the CE programs listed relate to education, which she indicates clearly is her area of research interest.  However, all 6 of the manuscripts in review (all of which are from 2009 … nothing prior to that) do relate to education.  She has been teaching for U Phoenix for 3 months &amp; was an RN in one institution for 15 months before that, while also being an agency RN (since 2003).  She taught for ECU for a total of 2.5 years as a CI.  Finally, her letter shows no effort, nor does it &quot;tell a story&quot; of who she is and why she is interested in teaching at DUSON.  I would not recommend this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not recommend this candidate, &amp; I do not even suggest we forward this to Dori for a CI position.  First of all, her MSN is in nursing administration, &amp; I know that Villanova&apos;s program has no advanced clinical.  Second, her work experience has been more in business &amp; clinical trials than in clinical practice … I see no recent clinical practice.  Third, she has 8 years teaching at CCP, but that was nearly 10 years ago; her more recent teaching at UNC-CH was as a CI, &amp; it&apos;s unclear whether it was for 1 semester or 1 year.  She lists 2 publications, the most recent of which is 2003.  I know she does not have a doctorate, but I would hope to see some kind of effort to share ideas with others -- however, I see no more recent publications, &amp; no presentations at all.  She lists membership in a few organizations, but notes no involvement in any of them.  Finally, she gives no dates for her degrees, so we don&apos;t know whether the MSN is brand new or 15 years old, and (b) her letter (like some others) is weak, superficial, &amp; gives no indication that she is trying to &quot;sell&quot; herself.  This candidate does not give me a lot of confidence, &amp; I recommend we NOT pursue her for FT or CI.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate seems strong, &amp; I recommend follow-up phone interviews &amp; a campus visit (if all sounds OK with the phone interview &amp; references).  His PhD is in technology management, he has extensive experience with technology &amp; information management systems, &amp; he has 6 years experience teaching relevant courses.  His professional associations are relevent to his area of expertise, but he reports no involvement in any of them.  He has a good track record of peer-reviewed publications (about 1/year), &amp; while there are no publications in 2009, he seems to have continued scholarly work in submitting a grant &amp; securing a few small grants.  He also lists a $350K grant, but it&apos;s not clear what his role was in it.  All of these scholarly efforts relate to his area of expertise, indicating that he is focused and committed to this line of work.  Again, I recommend pursuit of this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>To be honest, I&apos;m still not sure what exactly we are looking for in a DAST candidate, but this individual did not make my jump up &amp; shout, &quot;Wow.  This is it!&quot;  However, I would not reject her.  She has a PhD in Psychology, 2 years&apos; teacing experience, &amp; knows Duke.  It&apos;s really hard for me to know exactly what her current job entails, but it sounds more like outreach to me than visionary technology integration.  I was impressed with the 5-year, NSF-funded project, but it was to establish teaching fellows, not to develop/implement/ test some innovative technology.  The inquiry-based curriculum in engineering project (also supported by NSF through 2012, to the tune of $2.9M) sounds exciting, but it, too, does not convey a sense of visionary technology use as much as it seems to focus on curriculum development.  She has a 2008 presentation in Germany and a 2008 presentation at a virtual reality conference (both of which sound relevant for our position), &amp; then has 7 more presentations -- some of which focus on technology, but all of which are for the American Society for Engineering Education, not any technology-focused groups.  While this candidate&apos;s experience with virtual reality is exciting, I do not see a whole lot that screams &quot;I am on the cutting edge of a wide range of technologies,&quot; which is what I think we want for DAST.  I certainly would support follow-up steps, particularly since she seems to have been recruited, but her CV does not blow me out of the water.  (P.S.  For someone who has had a PhD [in Psychology no less] I am surprised at the weakness of publications, presentations, &amp; grants.  I wonder if she submitted an abbreviated version of her CV for some reason?)</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate was on the TIE Task Force, so has some &quot;inside&quot; view of ideas for DAST.  Nevertheless, her CV describes a most viable candidate, &amp; I recommend we pursue her for the position.  While she seems to have no formal preparation related to technology, she surely has been involved in many impressive initiatives related to technology, and she describes herself as an &quot;excellent spokesperson &amp; team-motivator for technology-enables learning, discovery &amp; engagement.&quot;  I also am impressed by her post-doc training on managing projects, her background in English (I think this keeps a technology person &quot;grounded&quot;), her work with EDUCAUSE, &amp; her statewide work on the RENCI project.  She has been in several positions for a very short time, but she also has held other positions (some simultaneously) for a number of years, which suggests a recognition of her expertise &amp; her success.  She also has taught for 13 years at UNC-G, &amp; has been affiliated with Duke since 2005.  She presents an impressive colleton of publications, presentations, &amp; grants.  Many of these scholarly activities are not related to technology, but they do attest to an individual with varied interests &amp; talents.  She lists no membership or involvement in professional associations, but I would equate her role as a scholar-in-residence with EDUCAUSE as serving the same purpose, and her specializing in &quot;forecasting technology trends&quot; for that highly-respected group certainly would seem to fit with our expectations of DAST.  I highly recommend pursuit of this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Seemingly well-qualified candidate for Informatics.  MS &amp; PhD are both in Healthcare Informatics, &amp; she has held important positions related to information management, including 4 years as Director of Nursing Informatics at MD Anderson.  Extensive experience in health care settings, which provides an understanding of the context for informatics in practice; however, she has no teaching experience at all, &amp; I wonder why she is interested (at this point in her career) to take on the academic arena?  Other than (presumably a small) grant from AONE to support her dissertation, I see no funded projects or grants.  She lists membership in relevant professional organizations, but notes no involvement in any of them.  2 manuscripts in review &amp; several of her more recent publications are quite relevant to informatics, as are her more recent presentations (in Finland, at AONE annual meeting, etc.).  I see no dates for her MS or PhD, so it&apos;s hard to tell how long she has had those degrees &amp; to make some assumptions about the impressiveness (or non-impressiveness) of her scholarly &amp; professional achievements.  I recommend a phone interview (particularly to address the &quot;Why teaching? And why at DUSON?&quot; questions) &amp; checking references, then bringing her to campus if all checks out OK.</Comment>

<Comment>Sharon Dormire, PhD is a tenured Associate Professor at the U-Texas, Austin Campus where she has been since 2002. She first worked with the Parent-Child option and when it was re-organized, she led the Maternity / Women’s Health specialty. Over the past 7 years, she has taught across programs, coordinated the alternate entry MSN program and served as a member of several doctoral (PhD) dissertation committees.  She has applied for the OB position with the DUSON ABSN program because she is committed to teaching womens health issues. If there is a good fit, she could move in the summer of 2010 when her current class of Maternity / Women’s Health MSN students graduate. 
Dr. Dormire describes the perfect position for her as one with a school located in an academic medical center (there is none at Austin), where she can teach across programs and engage in research (around aging, menopausal symptoms and endocrine function biomarkers).  She is most interested in finding colleagues in nursing and medicine who are interested in these same clinical issues. 
Note: Dr. Dormire says the recent retirement (August, 2009) of the dean (Delores Sands) and the appointment of an acting dean (Alexa Stuifenbergen), and the pending constitution of a new Dean Search Committee represents a transition period for the School and signifies for her a logical time to explore other options. 
Topics discussed:  The 3 types of DUSON positions; Typical workloads for DUSON faculty; PhD / DNP program participation; APT criteria &amp; review procedures at Duke University; Faculty candidate search procedures</Comment>

<Comment>Impression:   This is an articulate and engaging applicant who speaks of her teaching and clinical research topics with enthusiasm. Seven years after the post-doc, she likely would have to do additional work to bring her abreast of current trends in glucose transport and menopausal symptoms in order to be competitive as a new PI. My sense from conversation with her and with her references, is that she would be a strong ABSN faculty and while we might offer her some support in developing an R21 or RO1 around her topic, her primary contribution likely would be as a Master Teacher. I do recommend bring her in for the ABSN OB faculty position interview.  I believe she will be well-received by DUSON faculty.</Comment>

<Comment>Spoke with Dr. McLane on the phone.  She completed her PhD in April 2009 &amp; is now doing a PostDoc at Texas.  She is working on an NIH grant, for which she will be the PI if it is funded … but from which she would withdraw should she get a position here at DUSON.  The grant focuses on creating a portal for diabetes patients to access selected clinical information from their EMR, look at how their blook work (for example) compares with national standards, upload their finger stick data, engage in social networking, etc.  The assumption is that all this will have a positive impact on patient compliance with management regimes.  

When asked why she is interested in a teaching position (particularly in light of the fact that she has had no such experience in the past), she indicated she wanted the opportunity to work with colleagues, to do both research and teaching, to share her knowledge &amp; expertise in Informatics, &amp; to stay abreast of developments in her field.  She did not say anything about facilitating student learning, helping to create the next generation of nurse informaticists, etc.  When asked about why she is interested in DUSON, she replied that it is a well respected school &amp; would provide a &quot;nice opportunity.&quot;

Her interest in Informatics grew out of her work with software implementation projects at a job, &amp; she &quot;got hooked&quot; on the concepts.  When asked about what kind of impact she hoped her work/contributions would have, she spoke about designing screens for EMRs that would allow each nurse to select the kind of data she wants to see for a particular patient, given that patient&apos;s situation.  This interest is related to her dissertation work, which focused on how clinical nurses think about organizing knowledge &amp; presenting information.

She has recently submitted a revised manuscript to Advances in Nursing Science &amp; believes that the combination of her expertise in Informatics AND her many years in nursing/hospital administration provides a unique perspective she could bring to DUSON.  She did not elaborate on this, however.

For what it&apos;s worth, she sounded very nice, but I was not very impressed with her insight or vision.  I will, however, call her 3 references when I can (probably not this week while I&apos;m away) &amp; enter that information into our DB after I speak with each of them.  Finally, it had not connected for me when I reviewed her CV, but the only credential she has in NURSING is a diploma from a hospital school of nursing.  Her BS is in management/ marketing, she has an MBA &amp; an MS in healthcare informatics, &amp; her PhD is in healthcare informatics.  To be honest, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s acceptable for her not to have anything more than a diploma in nursing ?????</Comment>

<Comment>Phone Interview

I spoke with Dr. Caines on 10/19. She is excited about the possibilities of contributing to the ABSN program. She completed her PhD in Dec 06 from Vanderbilt (note that she completed a 2 year pre-doc LEAH Fellowship (Leadership Education in Adolescent Health. She initially accepted a position at University of Rhode Island College of Nursing (I have ref from here) and was there for about 2 years. She taught Fundamentals, Research, and Leadership. Was not given the opportunity to teach peds. and her research was not supported. She was not negative about this experience but decided to move to try and advance her program of research. She has spent the past year at University of Southern Maine, where she has found colleagues to help her develop her research. A community based program studying at risk youth. 

She is interested in Duke for the following reasons. She would like the opportunity to develop and teach in a Research 1 environment. She believes she innovative and has something to offer accelerated students, and she would like the opportunity to be mentored by leaders in pediatric nursing research. She recognizes that she needs to focus on her publications. Is also practicing as a PNP. I found her engaging and she asked appropriated questions. Would recommend we pursue. Her references were supportive and positive.</Comment>

<Comment>I conducted a telephone interview with Dr. Mize on 10/27.  She is a new DNP graduate from UVa with extensive clinical experience in pediatric acute and critical care.  She spoke opening about the fact that she went back to get her DNP to be able to engage pediatric students at a &quot;different level&quot;.  She is eager to work with graduate or undergraduate students now and would hope to be able to facilitate DNP students with the capstone projects with more teaching experience. She has been a preceptor for many years for pediatric nurse practicioners and has been responsible for the core curriculum of the staff nurses at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  She was an item writer for the Pediatric Acute and Chronic Nurse Practitioner exam, is bilingual (Spanish) and has traveled to Ecuador for many years to educate and provide care for children with congenital heart disease.  She has a husband who is retired and a 10 year old son that would be relocating with her.  She stated that Duke was one of the top 5 programs in which she was interested.</Comment>

Unless it is buried in the jargon, I do not see experience in teaching systems and methodology. If this is a position for Informatics faculty, he might be a viable candidiate.

<Comment>Applicant has moved quicky into academic circles since completing her MSN in 2006 with a focus on Nursing Education. She seems to have a clinical background in ED. Med-Surg, and Peds. She also seems to be technology savvy (but did leave track changes on documents). Had valuable experiences in grad school on curriculum update and revision for an ABSN program. Discussed at length in her cover letter a variety of innovative teaching stratgies she used to facilitate student learning. Students at UNC rated her teaching between 4.5 and 5 on a 5 point scale and offered  positive comments. Had experience doing clinical teaching and some coordination at GMU and has done the CI role at UNC. Has lectured in Adv. Adult Health and managed technology labs. Seems to be worth continued consideration for a CI position, at least.</Comment>

She has a long and distinguished military career with practice in her areas of specialization. She has strong teaching experience. She an expressed research interest, but minimal productivity; 3 published articles listed and one very small grant over career. Her PhD is in Interdisciplinary Studies inclusive of Nursing and Education. She has potential as Clinical Track faculty, but there is little evidence she would move beyond that. She would likely be a strong ABSN faculty member and could help in some ways in FNP program. Would suggest references be checked.</Comment>

<Comment>I believe Ms. Zhao submitted an application for a  nurse researcher before. She certainly has been prolific in her UNC student work and has several publications that are interesting. I think her far Eastern background is impressive but I would see her as more limited for OGACHI work in South American and Africa. Her research program will actually begin with her PhD degree (which she is not scheduled to receive for several more months). I think she is not the senior gero investigator that we would want to initiate / collaborate on international studies. To be consistent, we likely should talk with her, but I do not see her as a top candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant has a rich academic and experiential background that is consistent with many of our interest in SSA.  She is well prepared in the discipline of community/public health .  She has served in a number of administrative/directorship type positions. However, she does not have any teaching experience, or practice experience as a nurse; She has a number of research projects listed, but no evidence of grant preparation or grant funding; and no publications to-date.  Also, in nursing, her level of preparation is at the diploma level.  Given these limitations, the applicant does not satisfy the requirements for the position of faculty in community health.

Similarly, the lack of a track record in attracting funded research and publications,  decreases enthusiasm for the Senior Scientist position for OGACHI.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant is in dissertation phase of doctoral studies. Holds MSN in Maternal Child Nursing. She has taught Public Health/Community Health Nursing for appox. 6 years, inclusive of a specialized focus on pediatrics for three of the years. Has had limited comprehensive community health practice experience; primarily been involved in family planning and pediatrics. Her scholarly presentations do not support the expertise in community health. She associates herself with two programmatic grants on public health issues (alcohol awareness and smoking cessation; and family planning). She is listed as an author (2nd) on one referred publication.  I am very lukewarm on this applicant and could easily agree to a pass.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not see the background that would suggest strength as a candidate for Community Health Nursing. Other than the Certificate in Core Public Health Concepts, there is little else to justify readiness for community health nursing. Her career is eclectic involving variety in in-patient; staff development, and management roles. The breadth of community service projects is commendable, but are not proxies for community health nursing.

I saw comments from others and agree that it would be appropriate to talk with her. She came to see me about the Senior Research position in my office and ultimately did not apply for it.  I will pass as a volunteer to talk this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Chang holds a PhD in Nutrition and MSN in Med-Surg. Her area of research interest and productivity is with low income overweight and obese women. She has had a progressive research career, beginning with intramural funding.  Currently, she is PI on a R34 grant from NIDDK and has a R18 pending, also from NIDDK. I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Chang last week at MSU and she is solidly committed to community-based participatory research in her work with low income overweight and obese women. She shows all signs of a very successful research career in an area of importance and regarding health disparities.

She applied for a position in the ABSN program in Community Health Nursing. Her background and experiences, while community-based, are not consistent with the full range of expectations for public health/community health nursing. Her teaching has been primarily at the graduate level and in Research and Evaluation, Foundations of Scholarly Nursing Practice, Theory and Research, and Community-based Care which was team taught. I do not find overwhelming and compelling evidence to suggest that she meets the qualifications for Community Health Nursing. On the other hand, she may be an attractive applicant for another position, perhaps as a research scientist.</Comment>

<Comment>The fact that this candidate is a native of Jordan and currently teaches in Canada brings a unique perspective to what she might be able to contribute as a faculty member.  She does have 4 years teaching (in Jordan) as an instructor and 5 additional years (in Calgary) as a graduate TA, which is a strength.  And she is active in professional associations.  In addition, she is clear about how she sees the teacher as a facilitator of learning and about the need to transform nursing education to be more student-centered … perspectives that I would think strengthen her ability as a teacher.  However, she has only 2 publications (2007 and 1999), no grants, no research (other than her dissertation), and no significant presentations.  Of greater concern is her lack of current clinical experience.  She practiced as a nurse in Jordan from 1967 to 1973 (in a world that is totally different from what it is today), and it&apos;s unclear what her current (2005-date) work at the Alberta Health Services FMC is all about.  I would NOT recommend this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate has more than 12 years experience as Director of IT/Client Support Services in a hospital/health sciences center, and he claims to be skilled at building teams.  While both of these are strengths, he is only now working on a BS degree.  I do not believe this is an appropriate qualification for the DAST position we are looking to fill.  I would NOT recommend him.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate brings unique experiences of being educated and practicing nursing in Taiwan, and she is prepared in nursing at the PhD level.  Her unique contributions to the literature and in research are nutrition-focused.  She has a consistent record of presentations, continues to produce publications and manuscripts that are under review, and is active professionally.  Additionally, she has 6 years of teaching experience at Michigan State and 1 year as a TA at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  All these things are &quot;positives.&quot;  However, despite teaching a Patho course, it does not seem that she is &quot;up to speed&quot; on current clinical practice, which would seem to be essential for an ABSN position.  Her last practice position was in Taiwan in 1989, and although her scholarship has a clinical focus, it is limited to nutrition, which does not seem to provide her with a broad enough base to teach in an undergraduate.  I recommend that we do NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>As I reviewed this candidate&apos;s CV (and cover letter), I kept writing &quot;no focus&quot; … over and over again.  I honestly cannot tell what her passion is or her area(s) of expertise.  At one point I thought it was HIV/AIDS, but then I see older adults with dementia, nurse migration, education/practice, nursing workforce, mentorship, rural health, clinical doctorate, disparitites/inequalities in health, and on and on.  She completed a post-doc in 2005 in Epi and Biostats, but I see nothing in her CV that seems to indicate that being a focus of her scholarship.  She has 7 years of teaching in a community college, 5 at Grand Valley State, and 1 at Weber State (despite the fact that she has been there as chair and tenured professor for 4 years) … so she does have teaching experience.  And she has 13 years in education administration.  I wonder why she wants a faculty position??? She shows no involvement in clinical work since 1988, none of her grants are research-focused, it is not clear that any of her few &quot;research projects&quot; led to significant publications or presentations, and her publications are very limited in number (even though she has had her doctorate (PhD??) since 1998.  Even her cover letter does not indicate what she thinks she could contribute.  I recommend that we NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Seems to have submitted CV on a &quot;fishing&quot; basis … to see what might be available in the future.  Plans to complete PhD in Fall 2010 and have program of research outlined then.  Do hope she will continue to explore us, as her focus on pain management -- particularly in children -- is clear, she has a consistent &quot;track record&quot; of publications on the topic, and she has received several grants to support work in this area.  (I cannot convert CND to US $, so I don&apos;t know the size of these grants, but they do not look to be too big.)  She has been an invited lecturer in Brazil and Thailand (as well as throughout Canada) and is involved on professional committees.  Finally, she has recent experience as a CNS and some teaching experience as an adjunct/lecturer/clinical instructor.  She would seem to have potential in the future, but she is not ready for a faculty appointment at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Holds a doctorate in education, and most of her publications are focused on education issues/topics.  This candidate has extensive teaching experience -- 6 years in Oman, 4 as a Senior Nursing Tutor (???) in Oman, 10 years in Jordan, 1 in the Phillipines, and (it seems) 10 years in staff development education in Saudi Arabia -- and she has taught med/surg, critical care, fundamentals, assessment, and an RN-to-BSN bridge course.  She has 1 publication in 2007 and prior to that in 2001; however, she does have some papers under review. She lists several &quot;ongoing research&quot; projects, but there is no focus to them (i.e., the topics are quite varied).  Her &quot;cover letter&quot; says nothing, so I am left wondering why she wants to come to the US to teach.  I do NOT recommend pursuing this candidate.</Comment>

Her 2009 PhD in Community Health and her focus in primary care are appealing; however, her only preparation in nursing is at the secondary level, the &quot;expertise domains&quot; she outlines do not fit with our needs (though they are interesting), she has no research program, and she has no teaching experience.  I recommend we do NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate has extensive clinincal experinece in pediatric acute care practice.  In addition, she has been a director, clinical instructor and director of  pediatirc NP programs..  She is very active nationally in pediatric organizations.  She was among a small group of pediatric acute care NPs that organized the certification exam for the Peds acute and chronic NP.  She is co-editor of the pediatric acute care text book that is likely to be a text for acute care NP programs.  She has a national reputation and I think is a good candidate for this position.</Comment>

<Comment>This was a difficult CV to follow and to understand. Very eclectic array of accomplishment that makes it difficult to say with certainty what her focus is. Advanced degrees are in Epidemiology/Biostatistics; Public Administration, Adult Health Nursing on a community college base. A variety of teaching/administrative positions in senior and community colleges. An endless array of CE covering everything from global health to leadership, nursing education, policy, health disparities, public health, etc. She has a number of small grants; a host of travel grants, and a few large program grants which I am not sure if they were competitive or resulting from legislative initiatives. Her research seems to be on Perceived Knowledge and Health Beliefs about HIV/AIDS among students and nurses at points around the world. Since 2001, she has 5 accepted first author pubs and two pending, many on AIDS work.  Belongs to hundreds of committess on the national , state, local, and institutional levels. She has done some of everything, but difficult to label as one thing or another.

I am overwhelmed but not impressed with the diverse and voluminous array of works. There is not a focus upon which to judge a fit to need at DUSON.</Comment>

<Comment>A strong candidate with appropriate preparation and experience for the Acute Care PNP program.  11 years teaching experience includes some administrative responsibility and work on program transition.  20+ years experience as an NP is solid and varied.  Impressive involvement in NAPNAP, good involvement in other professional associations, and recognition through respected awards.  Publications are a bit light, but they are focused and current and suggest the potential to continue this kind of contribution.   Extensive national presentations and workshops, many of which were invited, which speaks to the fact that others recognize her expertise and contributions, as does her consultation.  Research is primarily locally-supported, but it is consistent, and it is focused.  I definitely recommend we pursue this candidate.</Comment>

I do not know that DNP program or its focus, but she does indicate she plans to sit for FNP certification upon its completion, so it must prepare NPs.  She plans to complete the program in May 2010.  Because she is so young in her career, there is limited practice experience, some TA experience, no involvement in professional associations, no research, and no publications.  I recommend we do NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Other than the fact that we &quot;know&quot; her a bit from her 1 semester teaching at DUSON, I see very little in this CV that would make me recommend pursuing her.  She does have good clinical experience as a staff nurse, but nothing as a CNS or whatever her master&apos;s prepared her for.  She has limited teaching experience (1.5 years at NYU and 1 semester at DUSON), and has held positions that involved her in research activities.    However, she has no research completed, has only 2 publications (1 of which is in an AJN career supplement and the other which is 6 years old), she is not involved professionally (despite holding an MSN since 1997), and she has not held any serious leadership position.  Regardless of how well she might be doing as a CI for us, her material is not strong, and I do NOT recommend pursuit.</Comment>

<Comment>Although this candidate is &quot;one of our own,&quot; I do not see any real strength in her material to warrant recommendation to pursue.  Her master&apos;s is in nursing administration, and it is not clear what kind of PhD  program she is in … though her letter says she is studying the experience of older male informal caregivers.  I would have liked to read some elaboration of why that is an important area to study and/or how she intends to pursue this line of investigation after the PhD.  While she has extensive experience in staff development and the positions she has held are varied, she has no academic teaching experience and all of her employment has been within the Duke system, which (in my opinion) limits the perspectives and broad experience she might bring to a faculty position.  She also does not document any significant experience in community health (though she dos hold a certificate in Core Public Health Concepts …whatever that means), which is a major limitation in considering anyone for a FT faculty position to teach such material.  Her publications are limited, and the 2 more recent ones (2006 and submitted/in review) that are listed provide very sketchy information … for example, who is the publisher on the one that&apos;s in review? and what were the titles of the chapters in the 2006 book?  She lists only one research activity (in 19990, and her presentations are primarily local or regional.  The presentation at the 2009 NLN Summit was a poster.  Her only recent (2009) &quot;professional achievement&quot; is Team STEPPS Master Trainer, but she does not say what she has done with that training, how it has helped her contribute professionally, etc.  She has been involved in some local/regional professional associations, but not for some time.  Finally, her letter speaks to her teaching philosophy, which is nice, but it is not particularly powerful, insightful, or convincing.  While I believe our Committee&apos;s response to this candidate should be handled personally, I believe the response we must send her is that we cannot recommend pursuit of her for this position.  Sorry.</Comment>

<Comment>While this candidate has an interesting background, I do not see that her CV provides enough evidence to warrant pursuit for the OGACHI research position.  She has not yet completed her PhD, and while her research experience (as a research assistant on many projects and a PI and co-investigator on 2 [seemingly] small projects in China in 2000-2002) provides a good foundation for future work, she has no funding, shows no evidence of writing major grants, and has not been the lead investigator on a major project.  Her 2 semesters as a TA at UNC and 7 years teaching in China document good and varied experience as a teacher, but I do not think this is particularly needed for the OGACHI position.  Her clinical experience is limited, she documents no involvement in professional associations, and her publications are not focused and no more recent than 2001.  I would, of course, defer to Dorothy, but I do not see this candidate as a particularly viable one for the OGACHI research position.</Comment>

<Comment>Interesting academic preparation (at master&apos;s and doctoral levels) in both nursing and education.  Extensive clinical experience, including military service, and solid teaching experience (12 years PT and 5 FT, all at U of Maine).  She has earned the rank of Lt. Colonel, which speaks positively to her leadership and management skills.  Unfortunately, this candidate has no current involvement in professional organizations, an inconsistent publication record (1993, 2002, and 2007/08), no grants, and no research experience.  Though I do not think this candidate is particularly strong, her solid clinical preparation and experience combined with her teaching experience lead me to think that a follow-up phone interview may be worthwhile.</Comment>

<Comment>It&apos;s hard for me to evaluate this candidate because I don&apos;t know enough about Informatics to (a) recognize the significance or unimportance of some of his areas of work (e.g., supply chain) or (b) know how &quot;cutting edge&quot; and well-respected he and his work are.  Nevertheless, he is appropriately credentialled … the MS in Health Systems would seem to be a plus, as would the graduate certificate in Management of Technology … though (unlike someone else&apos;s comment), I&apos;m not sure I see how a PhD in Economics would be particularly helpful.  He has 5 years teaching experience at ASU and some TA experience; this and his thesis supervision seem to be appropriate for our needs.  His publications are a bit limited (2 of them seem to be related to Informatics, he has none in 2009, 3 in 2008, 1 in 2007, 1 in 2006, and all others are 2003 or earlier).  He does, however, have 5 manuscripts in review, and 2 of them seem particularly relevant to Informatics.  I have no idea what &quot;working papers&quot; are, and on the 4 &quot;work in progress&quot; things listed, it is unclear to me what that means or what the status of these projects are.  He has been the PI on 2 very small grants and co-PI on several others (2 of which were more than $100K).  His paper presentations related to Informatics are limited -- like his publications -- with one accepted for a year from now, 1 in 2008, a few in 2006, and a few earlier than that.  He is a member of seemingly appropriate organizations with involvement in only 1 of them in 2005-06.  I am not overly impressed with this candidate, but if Constance sees strength in him, and other Search Committee members are supportive, I would not argue against doing a phone interview and calling references if appropriate.</Comment>

RE: procedural issue
Hi Dr. Davis,

While I am interested in the opportunities at Duke, I am having second thoughts about applying for the position.  My wife and I discussed the timing of a move and feel that a move this year is not good for us.  Other concerns included switching from health administration to a nursing school and restarting the tenure clock.  I appreciate your interest in me and thank you for your consideration.  However, I have decided to remove myself from consideration for this position.
 
I apologize for the late notice and hope that this has not inconvenienced you.  
 
Best,
MFF</Comment>

<Comment>I had a long interview with Dr. Ruter-Rice about her professional goals and how she saw Duke fitting into those goals.  Dr. Ruter-Rice is currently practicing as a peidatric critical care NP at Rady Children&apos;s hospital of San Diego.  She chairs their advanced practice council and mentors several other NPs.  Much of her current research has been through her support of other advanced practice nurses and pieced together with no funding.  Her main reason for wanting to come to Duke is to pursue her research.  While she loved developinjg and teaching at Vandy while  finishing her PhD the commute became too time consuming and took her away from her family for too long.  However, she got her PhD to conduct research and is seeking a position that values research and  will mentor her.  Her current job does not value research and does not do anything to faciliate her interest.  Her research interests are with the adolescent population.  She has not analyzed all of her disseration research of a large database of 1,700 9th and 10th grade boys around the issue of bullying.  She would like to finish that work and develop new work with adolescent active participation in decision making for their health care in the acute care setting.  Her husband has recently retired (mid 40s) from law enforcement and they are now mobile.  Dr. Ruter-Rice has always practiced as a part of her role and she is interested in having a faculty practice. 

She has young kids (9, 11) and would want them to finish out their school in California prior to any relocation.</Comment>

<Comment>A seemingly talented pre-doc scheduled to complete PhD in May. Area of interest is Depression and Heart Failure. Has been productive with  three first author pubs, numerous abstracts and national, regional, and local presentations. Has had good research training with excellent mentors, according to her dean. Has had teaching experience as a TA, undergraduate Med-Surg, and a number of guest lecture opportunities. Has one small grant and served of several grad student level committees. Recipient of a number of awards fpr excellence. Seems to have a bright future ahead of her. A solid junior faculty candidate who will benefit from mentoring. Would consider for follow up,</Comment>

<Comment>Strong resume with many scholarly accomplishments. Area of interest is pediatric pain. Has a 11 pubs where she is first author on 5. Many abstracts and presentations. Successful grant proposals. Has stayed focused on her primary research area. Teaching experience and has had good experience in academic role, including particpation on a number of committees. Has a number of international work exeriences, most in Saudi Arabia. Canadian citizen.

The downside of this applicant is that she has not completed her PhD and seemingly has a year to go. I agree with Terry that she would certainly be worth considering once she nears completion of her interdisciplinary PhD.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Wheeler is , in my opinion, a tremendously capable #2 person to a busy administrator, practitioner and researcher. She has demonstrated considerable success as a grants manager, grant and manuscript writer, and fund raiser. Her background in public health makes her suitable for the OGACHI position, but she does not have any original research to date. While she is the third author (usually) on pubs, not the first, although she may have been the primary writer. Whereas, she seems most capable, she had not completed her preparation as a scholar (no doctorate nor in process), which will put my office in suspect and her credentials do not match the position description. She seems like the type of person OGACHI needs and who could  enable the office to attract resources, grants, and enhance dissemination of  the offices&apos; work. However, working in someone else&apos;s shadows, she has not distinguished herself as  a researcher. She seems to be able to conceptualize and stratgically plan for where the office should and can move in the research arena, but again that is administration not necessarily research. She has interest in a number of public health areas of interest to OGACHI and for which she would welcome the opportunity to learn, and I lelieve OGACHI would proposer through her involvement.  She would possibly have been a very productive assistant director, but it is a researcher we seek….hopefully one who has a research interest , as well as possess the capabilities of Ms. Wheeler.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Zhao is a promising nurse scientist and educator; however will not complete doctorate until May, 2010.  She has had multiple opportunities to learn various research roles, to prepare grants, to write manuscripts, and give presentations. However, the position request a senior scientist with evidence of successful grantsmanship. She has not achieved this level yet, although she has potential. Her international experience is largely with persons of Chinese dissent and addresses cultural and other psychosocial factors related to mammography among Chinese immigrants. Her focus is not consistent with the OGACHI body of work in Central/Latin American, the Caribbean, and Tanzania. The cultural differences could pose challenges.  She has taught a lot of undergraduate courses. She may be beneficial to DUSON, but probably not in the Senior Scientist position advertised.</Comment>

Dr. Pritham currently teaches maternal-newborn nursing and women’s health care and also serves as a clinical instructor for 1 clinical group for junior students. Class sizes range from 30-50 traditional undergraduate students. She also teaches Advanced Pharmacology and Reproductive Health for FNP Students. She as recently completed a PhD in Interdisciplinary Studies (Nursing and Education), May 2009 and is seeking new opportunities. Her current Dean is aware. 

I used the line in her cover letter to ask her, “If I were in your classroom, what teaching strategies would be eclectic and embody humanism and realism”. She replied by saying that she does a lot in small group work and that she has a special sensitivity to diversity, ethnicity and the issue of poverty. I asked how she had begun to incorporate the new Essentials into her course. She already has a genomics component and expanding this area. She also has students participate in family planning and has them attend child birth classes in the community. With regards to her research, she would like more time to try and move this forward. I did not get the sense that this was a major focus for her although as she shared, with her current teaching and 1 day per week of clinical practice, there is little time for research. She would like to return to NC as she was previously stationed at Fort Bragg and is familiar with Duke. I found her engaging, thoughtful and would recommend that we follow-up with reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant with a variety of experiences. Given all those experiences, I would expect her cover letter to indicate which faculty position she is applying for? If she is applying for the ABSN Community Health position, she does not have a MSN in community health nursing. However she did teach community health nursing from 1999-2004. Overall, I see little focus and a collection of activites over a long career. PASS</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate is an FNP with a new DNP.  She has 6 years teaching experience -- both undergraduate and graduate -- and she mainatins an active NP practice, along with serving as a sub-primary investigator (a term with which I am not familiar) for pharmaceutical clinical trials.  I wonder how she does it all.  She was selected to complete the summer genetics institute through NIH and earned 12 doctoral credits from Georgetown for that work.  Her research combines genetics and breast cancer and while she has presented 2 papers on this work at NIH, it seems to have been part of the Institute.  She lists no other presentations or research, nor is she active in professional associations, though she is active in her community.  3 of the 4 grants listed are for tobacco free living, but it&apos;s not clear how that relates to her program of scholarship.  The focus of the $3K grant from NIH is unclear, though that also was in 2008 (which is when she did the Institute).  I am &quot;luke warm&quot; about this candidate.  I do not see her as totally unqualified, yet she does not strike me as particularly strong.  I would support a phone interview, but I also could support a &quot;pass&quot; on this candidate.  Sorry to be so &quot;wishy-washy,&quot; but I guess that&apos;s how I&apos;ve reacted to this CV.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate will complete the PhD in May 2010.  Her MSN specialty is Adult Health, and she has varied clinical experiences to support that broad area of potential teaching.  She has served 2 years as a TA and 2 years as a clinical instructor, so she has been &quot;exposed&quot; to the faculty role, but she has not held a FT position to date.  She has a commendable list of honors, and her publications are good for someone so early in her career.  Her publications and presentations reflect a focuse area of interest, and she has &quot;touched&quot; national audiences as well as local and regional ones.  While a member of several professional organizations, her only contribution to date is authoring a position statement for ONS; having worked for a national association that issues position statements, it is not my experience that one person would write and claim credit for such a work, but I do not know how ONS works.  Her letter expresses a passion for excellence in teaching and an interest in teaching and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.  This candidate seems to have potential for a position at Duke, and I would support a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate is more than a year away from completing her DNP.  Her MSN focus was nursing administration, though her thesis was on risk factors for falls in ambulatory elders in the community.  She has 3 years FT teaching in a small college and 2 years in a community college.  Publications are quite limited in number and &quot;power,&quot; and none are authored by her alone.  Her interest in technology fits with our strategic plan.  She has one small grant from her own school and no others.  She seems to have created positive relationships with the local hospital and works with them on several projects, which is valuable.  She keeps current with her own learning.  Despite these positive elements, I do not see her as a particularly strong candidate for our positions and would recommend we &quot;pass.&quot;</Comment>

<Comment>An interesting candidate from Austrailia, who brings extensive clinical experience in Peds and a clear line of research related to Heparin therapy in children.  She has been recognized for her achievements through awards and grants.  Though none of the latter have been very large, they are from national departments (Health &amp; Aging, Human Services) as well as from a foundation, her hospital, and industry.  She has a number of publications reflecting her research, including 2 in press, 5 in 2009, and 2 in 2008; additional publications continue back to 1998.  She has presented at several international conferences and has many abstracts published.  In addition, she has some degree of invovement in/contribution to the Nurses&apos; Board of Victoria, though her other professional involvement is non-existent.  Her only teaching experience seems to be as a &quot;guest lecturer;&quot; she has had no faculty appointments.  If we are expecting candidates to have teaching experience, she clearly does not bring that and would not be qualified.  However, she does bring other strengths that make her somewhat appealing.  A phone interview about why she is interested in a faculty position may be in order.</Comment>

<Comment>MSN &amp; NP for just about 1 year.  Was a TA while a BSN student, but has no other teaching experiences.  Held leadership roles in student nurses association at Hopkins, but has no other professional involvement (which is understandable since she is so young in her career).  No significant presentations or publications, though her work in South Africa  (again while a BSN student) sounds interesting.  Do not see her as qualified for our ABSN position.  Would recommend she acquire more experienxce as an ANP and then pursue a doctorate if her career goal is teaching.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate with good potential, but not qualified now for a position with us.  Holds BSN and MSN from U of Phoenix, but dates earned are not specified.  Now enrolled in PhD in Nursing Education program at Capella U, expecting to finish in December 2010.  Clinical experience primarily in adult health, and largely as a &quot;travel nurse.&quot;  Teaching for 3 years at Washington State U and indicates being &quot;bitten by the bug&quot; of teaching … pursuing educational research.  Good efforts RE research-related activities (while a student, I assume), but no completed research.  No involvement in professional associations, no publications, and no grants.  I suggest we &quot;pass&quot; on this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>2008 PhD from U Missouri-Dt. Louis.  MSN (from same school) is in nursing education.  Currently developing and implementing ADN program through ITT-Technical Institute (since 2008).  List of &quot;research interests&quot; is quite diverse, and I see no clear focus.  Other than her work establishing and teaching an Ethics course in the AD program, she has been a TA while a graduate student … no other teaching experience.  Most &quot;presentations&quot; sound like guest lectures.  One 2009 publication in American J of Critical Care and 2 others in review/revision.Member of several professional associations, but not involved in any.  Community volunteer.  Although this candidate is interested in moving into a research-intensive institution, I do not think she has the preparation or background for a position with us and would recommend &quot;pass.&quot;</Comment>

<Comment>Although this candidate has a PhD since 2007 and seems to have good clinical experience, her teaching experience is limited to clinical instruction or a TA role, with one exception … assistant course coordinator in fall 2009 for a practicum course.  She is beginning to make contributions through publications and presentations and is a member of several professional associations, but I believe she is too young in her career and too limited in her experience to serve as a specialty director.  She might be a candidate for the ABSN program if the need is there.  I recommend we not pursue her for the specialty director position but consider her for ABSN if she is interested.</Comment>

<Comment>January 11, 2010 Phone Screen with Rebecca Dekker

Ms. Dekker is an applicant for the adult health position in the ABSN program who will finish her PhD in May. She has an MSN in adult health nursing. Currently she is finishing data collection for her RCT that test the effects of a brief cognitive therapy intervention for depressive symptoms in hospitalized patients with heart failure. She has one paper that has already been published from this work and believes this study will provide preliminary data for a grant proposal that she hopes to submit later this year. She readily identifies Chris O’Connor as someone she would like to work with and the Duke Heart Center as an area where she could partner for research. She expresses a desire to teach in the PhD program and work with PhD students. When I asked about her desire to teach ABSN students which is what she talked about in her cover letter, she agreed that she could do that but would really like to teach at the PhD level. I shared with her my experience. I did ask why her dissertation chair was not listed as one of her references. She shared that he chairs the faculty search committee at UK where she has applied for a position. She asked appropriate questions and I believe she is a strong candidate that we should invite for an interview.</Comment>

Her breast cancer genetics work (paper and poster presentation with the same title from 08) do not seem to have produced a manuscript and then she has funding in tobacco free living? Unclear focus.

Certified as RNC in Inpatient OB and RNC (Neonatal Resuscitation Provider). TA in OB at UNC for one term and then TA in Clinical Education Resource Center and in Academic Counseling.
I am not supportive of this applicant. Believe we ought to be able to locate MSNs as Cis (although will complete MSN in May). Concerned that her MSN in Education in Health Care Systems does not provide a specialty base in Maternity Nursing. Do not recommend further consideration.</Comment>

<Comment>This is a recent DNP graduate (2009 from Uni. Alabama) whose career has moved along steadily since completing her BSN from a couple years of staff nursing to continuing her education at MSN level, Post-MSN FNP, and most recently DNP. She seems to have prepared herself in genetics through the popular channels: Georgetown (Molecular Genetics)and at the NIH at the Summer Generics Institute. She has taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels for a sum of 7 years and practiced as an FNP for approximately 3 years. Currently, she works with a pharmaceutical company  part-time invoved in clinical trials. She has two scholarly posters, no publications to-date, and several small grants through state tobacco money. I am impressed that this is a relatively young nurse who seems to be academically strong and destine on developing into an expert in genetics  research as evident by her preparation and study on African American women and breast cancer. There seems to be considerable potential. She is an African American and during a time when strategically, we value diversity, I think we need to  think seriously about her potential value to DUSON. While I recognize that we do not have an advertised position at this time for someone prepared in genetics, what is our genetics strength? Her research pertains to health disparities, another area where we are seriously under developed. I suggest we do not pass on this too quickly.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant holds BSN (2005) from Hopkins and MSN as an Advanced Practice Nurse Practitioner in Adult Oncology from University of MD (2008). Certified by ANCC as ANP (April 2009). Her first NP position,  I am assuming , was/is at Waverly Hematology in Cary. However, no dates for this employment are given. As of February 2009, she was employed as RN per diem at UNC on the Bone Marrow Transplant Team. I do know know if this employment is simultaneous with Waverly or post Waverly. If post Waverly, why is she working as an RN per diem? All of her practice has been in oncology. Will this limit capability in teaching general med-surg in the ABSN program? Applicant&apos;s scholarly work seems to be associated with graduate education. She was a MIRT Scholar in Durban, SA. And she developed culturally sensitive data collection instruments.Clarification of her employment dates is needed for Waverly Hematology. I am not very enthusiastic but think he shoud discuss.</Comment>

<Comment>The following comments result from a telephone conversation with Dr. Leah Cullins on February 9, 2010. Dr Cullins works as nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood 8 hours per week and FT in the summer doing complete physical, managing the birth control clinic, and managing male and female patients with STDs. A a sub PI with Dolby Pharmaceuticals, she does complete physicals as part of the protocols of clinical trials. She teaches in both the undergraduate and graduates programs at Southern University. At the BS level, she teaches leadership; at MS level, she teaches advanced health assessment to the nurse practitioner students. She integrates genetics content into advanced health assessment. Her dean has charged her to integrate genetics into all relevant nursing courses by 2014. She has one publication (2nd author) , Breast Cancer Fatalism and Breast Cancer Screening in African American Women (2006).  She described the experience in the NIH Summer Genetics Institute as comprehensive and that participants were required to do their own analyses under the supervision of mentors.  She does not see herself at this time as a major researcher, but has an interest in translational studies and ensuring that she is always practicing EBP. She deliberately elected the DNP program because she wanted a career combining practice and education. A PhD might be in her future, but not currently under consideration.  She wants to continue her work with  African American and Latino women with breast cancer and incorporate genetics into the practice. She intends to publich more. There was no overwhelming reasons for applying to Duke, other than she was seeking what opportunities might exist across a selective number of schools. Whereas I believe Dr. Cullins is focused and dedicated to developing her career, she is probably not a viable candidate for Duke at this time for  any of the positions that are currently posted.</Comment>

<Comment>Very articulate and engaging (although her conversations are jargon laden (e.g., &quot;democritrizing educational technology&quot;). I see her as an ideas person but not as a hands-on person. However, she is well-connected across the university and will be able to find a network of collaborators for our needs / projects. I do question whether we will see much of her but if there is strong support for her from the faculty, then I think she will provide us with a window to new educational technology ideas…</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant is currently a post-doc fellow at U of Kentucky. Promising research career, appropriate level of scholarship. While she did not specify a position, I would think with her adult health and critical care experience she would fit with ABSN. However I do not find that she is licensed in the US, nor has she practiced in US. We might want to call to follow-up on these questions.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not recommend this candidate.  Her PhD is not complete (though is planned for completion in 08/10), she has no publications (though there is 1 article with her as the 3rd author accepted for publication), and all her grant/research work is to assist others with their projects (e.g., with lit review, data collection, report writing).  Her international background and beginning record of presentations at national conferences are plusses, but I do not think they outweigh the limitations in her background.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not recommend this candidate.  She does not have a doctorate, nor is she enrolled in or planning to pursue such preparation.  While her research experiences have been extensive, none are nursing focused.  In fact, the description of her current position sounds like her responsibilities are more administration than research.  She has no teaching experience, no involvement in professional organizations, and all the publications/presentations she lists (while in impressive journals and at national conferences) are all for 1995-1996 only.  Her international focus is interesting, as is her MPH, but I wonder how well she would be able to be a spokesperson for OGACHI, since her last involvement with nursing was in 1985.</Comment>

<Comment>This is a candidate who would seem to have potential, but is not yet ready for our position.  She indicates completion of her PhD in 12/10, but indicates no defense date.  She has 2 publications in 2009 with 3 others under review, which shows signs of scholarly productivity, and she has 1 presentation (2008) at a national conference.  Grants are for dissertation support only, and she has done no research of her own (other than her dissertation).  Her teaching experience is only as a TA.  She shows some involvement in professional associations.  I do not see her as ready for this position, though she would seem to have future potential and might be encouraged to apply to us in the future after completing her PhD and achieving more professional goals.</Comment>

<Comment>My initial inclination is to say &quot;No&quot; to this candidate.  She has been working on her PhD since 2004 but gives no indication of expected date of completion, nor does she say anything about the focus of her dissertation or her future goals as a scholar.  It also is unclear what the focus of her MSN was.  She has no publications, no research, no grants, and no involvement in professional organizations.  However, she does have 18 years&apos; teaching experience (including 14 in BSN programs), she has taught a range of courses, she has been working as a staff nurse while doing her PhD work, and she actively provides service to her nursing department, university, and community.  Perhaps a phone call would be in order to explore her plans for completing the PhD, the focus of her research, etc.  If we need individuals to teach in the ABSN program, I think she could do that.  But if we want a well-rounded, accomplished individual to do that teaching, I do not see this candidate as filling that bill.</Comment>

<Comment>Interesting candidate with political experience, policy experience, extensive publications, and impressive consultant positions.  It is not clear, however, where the &quot;fit&quot; would be with DUSON.  I do not see extensive research activities, and although he has done some teaching, I&apos;m not sure how his background/experience would fill any gaps we might have.  I would recommend we pass on this candidate unless we are searching to fill a position that more apporpriately aligns with what he can contribute.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not recommend this candidate as she does not meet the requirements for such a leadership position.  Her MSPH from Harvard is impressive, but it will not be completed until 06/10 (though she does have an MA from Korea) and it is not a doctorate, which is essential for this position.  All of her research work has been in &quot;assistant&quot; roles, with no leadership roles in designing or implementing research.  She has no publications, no grants, and no significant professional involvement that might suggest leadership skills.</Comment>

<Comment>Most interesting background, and MBA from Wharton and PhD from Penn are impressive.  She has extensive teaching experience (FT, adjunct, and clinical) in nursing and public health at a variety of schools, including Duke.  Her experience as a program associate at the RWJF is interesting, but it was in 1986-87 and may not be helpful to our future funding pursuits.  She is very actively involved in professional associations and in the community.  However, her publications are weak (1 in 2009, 1 in 2007, and the rest go back to 1999 and earlier) and none are research-related, her research and its funding has all been internal and limited in scope, and her presentations (though extensive) are primarily local or regional (particularly the most recent ones).  She does not impress me as a candiate for the Health Services Research position, and I recommend we pass.</Comment>

<Comment>I do not think this candidate is qualified for the HRS position; however, she MAY be someone to explore for the Informatics position.  She has teaching experience and some involvement in university service, a completed PhD, and post-doc experience.  Her publications (which focus more on technology and information management) are interesting; 1 is in press, 3 were in 2009, and 3 were in 2008; however, despite having her PhD since 12/05, she has no other publications … and none seem to be research-based, though it&apos;s a bit hard to tell.  She has some national presentations and several interesting invited presentations (e.g., Ministry of Health of th Government of Singapore).  Her research grant efforts are many, but she has only 3 funded projects … a 3-month one for $4K+, and 2 year-long projects funded internally.  Finally, she is somewhat involved professionally.  Again, POSSIBLY someone to explore for Informatics, but only if Constance sees her as a viable candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>This is to let you know that I did speak with Samir Soneji today. I told him that we were very impressed with his accomplishments,  although his CV did not sufficiently match the position for which he applied. I told him we would like to keep him in an active file should a position materialize that reflected his credentials. He was pleased to know that we took notice of his accomplishments. I asked him about any global work he may have done and his level of interest. He along with his wife, who is a sociologist, are studying the differences in the fertility of women living in slums and those  not living in slums in India. He is also looking at the implications of in-migration from rural to the more developed areas on fertility. I asked if he could just write a note to me about this work and if anything came up in his area of expertise the Committee would advise him.  Dorothy</Comment>

<Comment>A productive seemingly young practitioner/researcher  well prepared in maternal infant /midwifery.  She has a growing program of research and publications. Apparently, currently a post doc. She is progressing through the ranks of researcher from research assistant forward. She is limited in teaching experience, only having been guest lecturer. She has secured funding for her disserations, an F-31 award, and a post-doc award to support  her current post doctoral training.

This applicant shows every indication of becoming an outstanding scientist. My only reservation regards her inexperience as a teacher, time requirement , and commitment to the demands of the ABSN program. 

I am supportive of bringing her to campus, but with caution relative to above.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Shepperd is a tenured professor of psychology at the U of Fla who has become frustrated with the limited &quot;out-dated&quot; research support infrastructure that is a common dilemma for faculty in public institutions. He is seeking a position that will allow him to: conduct research around crafting messages to reduce health behaviors that increase cancer risks, teach (he wants to teach health behavior issues and research methods), and some  community service (he has been a department chair and would do so again if needed). He has had little experience with nursing students but is willing to learn.  

Dr. Shepperd&apos;s research record is outstanding and his publication list is impressive. Right now, he has about 25% extramural funding support (from a private foundation) but is about to submit a second proposal (to NCI) which would bring him up to ~50%.  NB:  Dr. Shepperd has approval for a 6-month sabbatical from U of Fla this year and may have some pay-back obligation (he is not sure how much) if he accepted another position. 

My impression is that he has  research program and teaching focus overlap with Isaac Lipkus. However, if we are seeking a non-nurse health services researcher, Shepperd would be an excellent candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>A very focused, highly accomplished candidate.  Her clinical experience is extensive and varied … home care, community centers, hospitals.  She is clearly focused in her publications and presentations, has a consistent &quot;record&quot; of contributions via writing and presentations, has published many first-author articles and published in prestigious journals, and has presented at national and international conferences, as well as local and regional ones.  She is a member of &quot;appropriate&quot; professional organizations, but documents no involvement in any of them.  The biggest concern I have is that she has no teaching experience other than being a guest lecturer on 3 occasions which (I would assume) focused on her area of expertise.  She has no experience teaching a broad range of topics or managing a course.  While I appreciate her desire to continue her research and am pleased that DHD could mentor her, I worry that by doing so she would not be available to meet the teaching needs of the ABSN program.  If we are willing to recommend another candidate whose primary contributions will be research and if that meets the needs of the ABSN program, I recommend we follow up with this candidate.  But if the real need is for someone who can &quot;hit the ground running&quot; in terms of teaching and &quot;manage a course,&quot; I&apos;m not sure this is the right person.</Comment>

Overall, she has a a few very small grants (largest $1000); and 4 per-reviewed publications (latest is 2007). She has a number of &quot;invited posters.&quot; (do not know if that means she preseneted the posters). Overall, her stengths seem to be in teaching and practice as an Adult Nurse Practitioner.

<Comment>3-11-2010 Telephone interview summary
Dr. Bettger holds a doctorate in Rehabilitation Science from Boston University (2006). Before then, she worked with the American Heart Association where she was the Health Initiatives Director.  In that role, she worked across disciplines around developing community-based projects primarily around stroke. Her experiences in that role helped her to value research as the basis for rehabilitation care and policy development. Her post-doctoral fellowship (2007) under the aegis of a T-32 at UPENN provided her with the opportunity to join interdisciplinary teams in aging research. She co-taught social policy and program evaluation at UPENN. Although she had an MD as her post-doc research advisor, she sees Mary Naylor at UPENN as her primary mentor and advisor at that institution.

Dr. Bettger is interested in Duke because she believes the resources and the interdisciplinary spirit of collaboration are what she is seeking for her career development. If the fit is good, she could move in the summer of 2010. When we discussed the possible linkages here, she noted she currently is not eligible for a VA appointment because she is a Canadian citizen, however in the right situation she would relinquish that for U.S. citizenship. She sees her research colleague matches at DUSON as being Drs. Anderson, Gilliss, Davis and Vorderstrasse. She mentioned that she can teach health care policy and program evaluation and would need a bit of protected time to initiate her research program. 

My impression is that this individual will be a good addition to many research teams within and outside of DUSON but will need a mentor to become an independent investigator. She noted her need for a senior mentor.</Comment>

Dr. Wu is a post-doctoral fellow at U of Kentucky (2.5 year fellow). She completed her MSN at U of Penn in 93 and has been at Kentucky since 04 where she completed her PhD in 07. She is licensed in the U.S. but has never practiced in the states. However she wishes to gain experience in the clinical setting and is open to the idea of teaching in the ABSN program and doing clinical with students. Currently her research activities allow limited patient contact and she states that she enjoys working with patients. 

Her previous teaching experience was in Taiwan where she was a lecturer in the Department of Nursing. She also served as a Department Chair and has prior work with student recruitment. She has not taught in the states. 

She has 2 funded projects. One from American Heart Association which has supported her post-doc ($88.000) and another from American Association of Critical Care Nurses ($10.000) which has supported her research. She hopes to submit an R01 level application but admits that she has little experience with the NIH submission process. She also identifies that she needs support for writing. Currently writing is done as a team effort. 

She believes she could teach Adult Health, PhD Seminar courses, Stats, and Research.    

She revealed that she has an offer from UCLA that she must respond to by the end of April. My impressions. Bright, articulate, willing to work hard. I had a little difficulty understanding her but I think this may have been that she was talking fast and she seemed excited. She has a promising program of research and is a a fit with current cardiovascular research. If we have a position we should conduct reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant currently in Post-doc training at Uni. of Kentucky (did a pre-doc there as well). Her area of specialization is in Cardiovascular. She has an impressive and emerging research career. Strong list of publications, many where she is first author  ( a collaborator  on a publication with Rebecca Dekker, another research applicant). Minimal grant success; no US grants are from a governmental agency…two from nursing associations; only list amount of one $10,000 grant from the Gill Endowment. Hno teaching experience in the US, unless that should be assumed during her pre and/or post doc experiences. However, she does not list any teaching. At this point, she seems like a research track applicant.</Comment>

<Comment>Linda Haddad has an impressive CV. She is an accomplished academic. She holds a PhD in Nursing from University of Maryland and an MS from Upenn in Community Health Nursing. She has a strong teaching record at the undergraduate and graduate levels, stong list of publications, and a  short record of completed and pending research (one P-20 award completed) (17 years since completed doctorate).

She is an exceptional candidate for the Global Health Researcher position; Her strengths, in addition to above include: Director of a WHO Nursing Collaborating Center; extensive list of short term consultancy; focus on health promotion across the life span; member of NLB/NLNAC Global Task Force on Accreditation; research in  primary area of interest, smoking cessation all done in Jordan; other interest in impovished areas, water contamination, environmental health (an up and coming international area of focus at Duke); strong administrative background and leadership qualities; consultant to USAID.

Areas of concern (at this time); Her interest in Middle East inconsistent with OGACHI current foci in Caribbean, Africa, and potentially Singapore and China; OGACHI&apos;s  current work in Aging and Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases, with a growing focus on Orphan children who are victims of AIDS. There has been no discussion of growth into the Middle East, but that could be a future possibility.  One comment on CV that she is on-leave from position at Jordan University of Science and Technology.

I recommend a follow up telephone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Natasha Donnelly expects to complete  PhD from the Uiversity of Reading in England this year. Since 2006 has been focused on her studies and helping family settle in NC. He area of interest is in Mental Health, particularly pertaining to children. She founded a national charity, Children in Mind which has prospered and led to some awards, a number of publications,  and presentations.. It appears that most of her pubs are non-referred, but she seems to be working on some evidenced-based articles.  No evidence of research funding.  States she has over 10 years of teaching experience. Had a year in South Africa working as part of a large AIDS research study.   Her interest area has some relationship to the OGACHI work in the Caribbean (mental health and health services) and emerging HIV work with children in Tanzania. Her British background helps her to match somewhat to Caribbean.
Unfortunately, her research productivity and fund raising success do not match expectations of the position.</Comment>

<Comment>Appears to be a strong candidate; placement in the first tier suggest the same.

My comment makes note of the candidate&apos;s work on aging and its  relevance to the evolving research on aging and chronic non-communicable diseases in the Caribbean. (rehabilitation is one of the components  of the  Pillars framework  that has evolved).  He could be a good collaborator on some of the potential research projects between Duke and the University of the West Indies. If he makes a visit to Duke, I would appreciate the opportunity to talk with him about our work in Caribbean and to see if he has any interest in possible research projects.</Comment>

From an OGACHI standpoint, she could be helpful to us in Caribben with her Informatics and organizational modeling experiences (This does not mean she has credential for the Global Research position).</Comment>

Dr. Bell is committed to the development of an interdisciplinary program of research in conjunction with sharing her clinial expertise with prelicensure students.  She is a skilled presenter and I believe would take on the task preparing herself to excel as a teacher with the same methodical care as she has done in her preparation as a researcher.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Hockenberry is a senior pediatric oncology nurse scientist who is very interested in returning to Duke where she practiced as a pediatric nurse pratcitioner.  After consulting with the Dean, I invited her for an informal visit to the school while she was in town visiting with her brother who was enrolled in the Duke Fitness program.  She visited with Sharoon Docherty, Diane Holditch-Davis and myself.  Dr. Hockenberry is looking for a place to move to where she would stay until she retires.  In looking for her next position she wants to return to an acedemica role where she can continue her own program of research and mentor both new faculty researchers and students.  She is looking for a permanet position when her son goes to college in the fall of 2012.  She is also interested in a visiting professorship prior to fall of 2012.</Comment>

She has similari research interests to Issac and would be able to teadh in masters or ABSN program.  FNP, community health.  Again, it is unclear if we need another faculty in this area, but appears to be a promoising candidate with 3 peer reviwed pubs and 2 small grants.</Comment>

<Comment>A strong candidate with extensive teaching, administrative, &amp; international experience.  Degrees from respectable schools.  WHO collaborating center director, hospital administrator, &amp; apparently highly respected in her home country of Jordan (if all her special appointments &amp; service on significant boards is an indication).  Active in employing institutions &amp; professional associations.  I&apos;m not sure I know exactly what &quot;short term consultant&quot; means, but she has served in this capacity in Libya &amp; Pakistan, &amp; served as a consultant/advisor in Syria, Jordan, Dgypt, &amp; Canada.  Very limited research experience, with only 1 NINR-funded pilot study on which she served as PI.  Invited speaker &amp; research presenter at prestigious national &amp; international conferences; published in respected journals; extensive collaboration on publications though has been first author on many.  Although the research background is the weakest part of this CV … and although the OGACHI position is for a researcher … I think this candidate is worth pursuing, given all her other strengths.  I recommend we check references and, if all is OK, arrange a visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate is already scheduled for a visit, so these comments may be moot, but …  In 10 years, this individual moved from holding a BA in Kinesiology to completing a post-doc.  Obviously a driven person!  Teaching experience is largely limited to guest lectures, a teaching fellowship &amp; a TA position, but she has also taught on campus and online courses.  Has held responsible positions that demonstrate leadership ability (e.g., coordinator of stroke initiatives for the MA Department of Health &amp; health initiatives director for the AHA).  Involved in several research projects, but served as PI on only 1 1-year grant; has 4 proposals under review where she is the PI on 1 and co-investigator on 3.  Publications are slow in evolving (1 in 2006, 1 in 2007, 3 in 2008, 2 in 2009), but currently has 4 under review.  Has presented at major conferences &amp; been an invited speaker on health services topics &amp; collaboration in health care.  Would seem to be well qualified for the upcoming visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Excellent background for a nursing faculty position -- extensive teaching experience, experience in clinical setting (staff, education &amp; administration), extensive &amp; consistent publications in reputable journals, continuous involvement in research in various capacities (incuding PI), extremely active in professional associations, a good &quot;citizen of the academy,&quot; &amp; fellowship in the AAN  Presentations are sporadic (with a 2-year hiatus in 2006-2008 &amp; another in 2008-2010) &amp; not as impressive as I would have expected, given the other information in the CV.  Despite all this, however, I do not see her as a strong candidate for the HSR position, as I see no significant contributions in that area.  She does not seem to have the history or networks to be a leader in HSR research.</Comment>

<Comment>Not being familiar with the British system, it&apos;s difficult to evaluate (or even make sense of) many of the things on this candidate&apos;s CV; thus, she may be much more qualified and &quot;impressive&quot; than I am able to judge.  Her master&apos;s is in Social Research Methods, not Nursing, though her work clearly is related to the needs of children, particularly those with mental health issues.  Despite the focus of this degree &amp; despite her expression of interest in research, I see no listing of research she has completed or grants she has received to fund such projects.  Her letter mentions &quot;involvement in a large scale medical research project in Africa in 1993,&quot; but it is not clear what that project was or what her &quot;involvement&quot; was … or how (if at all) she built on that work in the past 17 years.  She states she is in her &quot;final year&quot; of the PhD, but gives no specific date for completion or report on the progress of her work.  None of the publications listed appear to be peer reviewed, &amp; the status of the 2 that were to be &quot;forthcoming 2009&quot; is not known.  Experienced teacher with a post graduate certificate in Learning &amp; Teaching, as well as membership in her university&apos;s Higher Education Teaching Academy.  While she seems like an interesting candidate, I see no HRS focus or international work (other than that she is from Great Britain &amp; has worked in those practice &amp; education systems).  I am impressed that she founded &amp; headed up the new national charity called Students in Mind, but my &quot;read&quot; on her CV leads me to think we should not pursue her for either the OGACHI or the HRS position</Comment>

Most consulting listed is internal &amp; gives no indication that she is sought out for any particular area of expertise.  No research, publication, grant or professional involvement activity.  Finally, her cover letter is weak &amp; the &quot;educational philosophy&quot; she expresses makes no sense to me.  I recommend we pass on this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Highly accomplished individual who is a FAAN.  9 years teaching at Baylor College of Medicine, 16 years directing ANPs in the cancer center at Texas Children&apos;s Hospital, 7 years directing EBP initiatives.  Experience teaching nursing (6 years) was in 1987-1993 &amp; is not current.  Extensive &amp; continuous funding for research from NINR, foundations, ONS, &amp; other sources; served as PI on many studies.  Member of several professional associations, though not particularly active in them; however, does currently serve on editorial board of 5 journals (I wonder how she does that!!!) &amp; sevral review panels.  Active speaker throughout her career, with many presentations at national conferences.  Continuous publications -- research-focused and other -- in well-respected journals, as well as contributions through other media … 18 books (some of which are major texts), 22 book chapters, websites, videotapes, and CAI programs.  If we are in need of a pediatric cancer researcher, she would seem qualified for such a position, &amp; I would recommend we pursue her for that.  If there is not such a need, I see no fit with the positions we have open.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate certainly seems to be someone &quot;on the rise,&quot; but I have some concerns about considering her for a faculty appointment.  She became a nurse sometime during her MS program (2003-2006) I assume, as her CV shows no nursing preparation prior to that.  Although she has completed a certificate in Public Health Genetics &amp; a PhD from UDUB, &amp; is completing a post-doc since receiving the MS, she has no clinical practice experience and no teaching experience.  Also, while her evolving expertise in genetics is timely and relevant, I wonder if that is a need at DUSON.  What would she teach were she to come on faculty?  She has an inconsistent record of publications (2 in 1992 that focused on legal issues, 2 in 2007, 1 in 2008, none in 2009, &amp; 1 in 2010) but the recent ones are in well-respected journals, she has another MS under review, &amp; one can expect she will continue the trajectory of publishing.  She has presented at state &amp; regional conferences, &amp; has had 1 ISONG presentation &amp; 1 NINR poster.  While she clearly is developing skills as a researcher and evolving in terms of her expertise in genetics, she has not had a major role (e.g., PI or co-PI) on a research project.  It is unclear from her letter just which &quot;position announcement&quot; she is interested in, &amp; I am unclear where she would &quot;fit&quot; into our open positions.  As a result, I do not recommend we pursue her at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Received PhD in March 2010, focus of which sounds congruent with HSR focus.  Seems to have &quot;jumped around&quot; with employment -- somewhat short appointments (until more recently) &amp; moving from TX to NC to MN -- and been in positions that do not show any clear area of commitment/expertise or increasing responsibility/leadership.  Does have current experience (as a consultant) with managing organizational projects &amp; leading strategic initiatives that relate to health care.  Publications are very limited, &amp; she has one grant from the Foundation of the company for which she works … and the foundation where she serves on the research subcommittee.  6 of her 8 presentations have been at the MN HSR conference, which is positive in terms of HSR but limited in terms of the scope of her involvement and potential impact.  Has been a guest lecturer and taught classes sporadically, &amp; seems to have taughe one graduate seminar on Teaching in Higher Education (though she documents no preparation or expertise in teaching or higher education).  Her HSR work/focus seems to have some strength, but the remainder of her CV is unimpressive.  I recommend we pass, though I would not argue should the committee wish to follow up with a phone interview and reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate seems to be a beginning scholar who expects to complete PhD in May 2010.  Holds an MPH &amp; an MSN, &amp; is an FNP.  Has a good start with publications and is the PI on 2 small research grants.  Presentations are increasing (1 in 2007, 3 in 2008, &amp; 3 in 2009 [all of which were at the same national conference]) &amp; all seem relevant to his (?) research.  Has 2 years full-time teaching experience (community health &amp; nursing education), taught fundamentals as an adjunct x 1 year, &amp; has been a TA in health assessment x 2 years.  4 years practice as an RN &amp; 3 as an NP, the latter of which is current.  Membership, but no involvement, in professional associations.  While this candidate does not come across as a &quot;super star,&quot; he seems to be growing in his career &amp; would bring some teaching experience to an ABSN position (if that&apos;s what he&apos;s intersted in).

<Comment>This is information from a telephone conversation with Sarah Birken:

Applicant has worked as a Teaching Assistant for two years at both the MS and PhD levels. She has taught  a number of courses, inclusive of those listed in her CV. The course she is most passionate about is Organizational Theory (she has great interest in system&apos;s dynamics).  Although not officially announced, she is scheduled to teach Organizational Theory to doctoral students in the fall. In her role as TA, she develops teaching plans, delivers instructional sessions, collaborates in the development of examinations and helps score exams. She has taken a course on teaching as a part of her doctoral curriculum and has focused on MS  and PhD teaching.  

There are two positions, she describes as executive leadership positions: (1) Manager of a Quality Improvement Committee at a clinic where she worked (details listed in CV); (2) Project Manager  for the reaccreditation self-study in the School of Public Health @ UNC. When asked how she got this position, she explained that she had been in the School of Public Health for 6 years and had gained the respect of the dean and associate dean. She noted that she was also selected for a university merit award as a MS student and consequently, was able to secure funding throughout the MS program. Consequently, she was well known, well regarded and her skills well recognized. She thought the position was much like a very large research project, so in that sense, she  was able to use some of the knowledge and skills aquired through her studies in Health Services Research. She worked on the reaccreditation project for 1.5 years, from mid-point to completion. 

Despite the two projects she worked on, she has had no official position as a health services researcher or as an executive level leader. 

The applicant&apos;s research is rooted in failed quality improvement innovations. The role of middle mangers has been under addressed in QI innovations; thus her study investigates the middle&apos;s manager&apos;s role in HDC implementation (description part of her application package).

Ms. Birken was very articulate, passionate about her work,  and seemingly a very accomplished student. She is eager to enter academics when  she  launches her career as a new PhD ( anticipated completion date 12/10).</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Haddad has been in the US since 2007 and has continued her research work with Jordon since being here. Her primary interest is in health promotion and tobacco useage. However, in responding to the current focus of projects in OGACHI, she indicated that she has also been working with Chronic Diseases in Jordan . Her description of the rise in chronic diseases in Jordan parallels the trajectory in the Caribbean. She has not specifically focused on aging. She feels she is effective in developing research grants and grants to do project evaluation. When questioned about value of grants developed in Jordan (as the dollar value of only one from Jordan was listed), she noted a half a million dollars was granted for a  partnership project to enhance nursing education at the Jordan University of Science &amp; Technology. As to the absence of amount for other &quot;funded grants&quot; listed, she said she could send that to me and that it was not customary to list amount in Jordan.I found this curious and inconsistent and she did not just offer to verbally provide dollar amounts.    It appears that she was PI on three awards on smoking  from Jordon University of Science and Technology;  and PI on a pilot study apparently associated with a NIH  P-20 award to another person (2008-09). Dr. Haddad has a RO-1 application in review (Second hand smoke among Jordanian women and children). She is hopeful that her application will be scored.  She noted that she applied for the DUSON position because she felt her career  and passion was not moving as she had hoped at VCU. She noted that she spends most of her time teaching at the BSN (Community Health) , MSN (Healthy Planning Course), and PhD levels (Nursing Education) and not as much time to travel globally to do projects and conduct her research. Despite this, VCU has paid for her to make two trips to Jordon to continue her research on tobacco and smoking cessation. In summary, she expressed interest in the scope of the work being done through OGACHI and asked if we might be able to connect her with a collaborator in tobacco use and health promotion in Caribbean (the answer was yes).   We also talked about the potential for expansion to other parts of the world. I believe that Dr. Haddad has strengthens and potential, including head of a WHO Collaborating Center and good record of publications and international consultations. However,  she would not be the best match for the current international portfolio of DUSON.</Comment>

<Comment>I had a phone conversation today with Dr. Mullen as a follow-up to the Committee’s review of her CV.  This was a “cold call” that had not been scheduled in advance, but when I offered to arrange something for a future date, Dr. Mullen indicated she would be happy to talk with me now.  She confirmed that she completed her PhD on March 1st of 2010 and that she continues to work for HealthPartners, but is “ready to move.”

I asked about her teaching and what she thought she could contribute at DUSON.  She noted that she has taught leadership/management in an MBA program and is now teaching as an adjunct in 2 MHA programs.  She believes leadership/management principles are relevant to many courses and programs and would feel comfortable teaching those topics.  She also has taught policy development – particularly in relation to health care ethics, research ethics, and research methods – and would be comfortable addressing these topics in a research methods course.  

Dr. Mullen had not looked at the DUSON website in a few months, so she could not identify specific courses we offer as ones she could teach, but she did say that in general she could teach methods (e.g., data analysis, research, critical reading of research), health care delivery systems and organizations, organizational behavior, leadership, ethics, management, and teamwork.  She seemed to talk more about classes or concepts rather than taking responsibility for an entire course, but I did not “drill down” to that level of detail with her.

As for working with large data sets, Dr. Mullen said she is very experienced with this, both through her employment and her education.  She has worked for ten years on data integration, analysis, and reporting but was unable to publish any of that work because it was proprietary.  She is comfortable doing surveys and knowledgeable about how data flows through care delivery systems and the caveats to consider regarding the use of those data.

When I asked about her research interests, she did not seem to be particularly focused.  She talked about wanting to know more about (1) health care practitioners, the systems in which they work, and how their roles are changing and (2) patient outcomes  …  but her “interest” in both areas was vague and unfocused.  She currently is involved (as a member of the scientific and recruitment committees) with a team from the University of Minnesota that is conducting research related to the effect of bariatric surgery vs. no surgery for overweight (though not obese) diabetics.  This study has data collection sites in New York (in collaboration with Columbia University) and Taiwan, as well as Minnesota.

Dr. Mullen sounded lovely on the phone and seemed energetic and interested in moving in a new direction, now that her PhD is completed.  She does not, however, have “executive leadership of complex organizations” experience, not does she have “an active program of research” or “graduate nursing education teaching experience” (though she does have experience teaching at the master’s level in other fields), all of which are noted in the position description.</Comment>

<Comment>An interesting candidate, but I see nothing in her CV that speaks to health services research.  She has 4 years teaching experience at U South Carolina and has taught a variety of (presumably) BSN level courses; however, she has not been engaged in clinical practice since 1998 and has never practiced in the US despite being licensed as an RN and PNP.  She is author #1 on 2 publications and author #2 on 2 others, all of which are in most respectable journals and all of which have been published (1/year) since receiving her DNS; there are no publications since the 1 in 2008.  None of her publications have anything to do with HSR concepts.  The CV talks about manuscripts &quot;ready for submission&quot; and &quot;in preparation,&quot; as well as 2 research proposals &quot;ready to submit,&quot; but all of this seems quite vague.  Additionally, the research proposals &quot;ready to submit&quot; are on 2 quite different topics.  Her letter talks about her change in research focus because of lack of funding, yet these &quot;ready to submit&quot; proposals retain her original focus.  It is not clear to me what her focus really is and where her passion truly lies.  She is currently a member of 2 professional organizations but shows no involvement in either one, and neither relates to advocacy, PNP practice, diabetes, or HSR.  She has been involved in governance at the SON and university level, and the invitation to serve on the Diabetes Initiative of SC implies that she is recognized for her work in that area, yet she lists no research, publications, professional involvement, practice or consultation related to diabetes.  I do not think this candidate is at all qualified for the HSR position, and although I see some positive points for an ABSN faculty position, I do not see her as particularly strong overall.  I recommend we pass.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate comes with 3 years&apos; teaching experience (Med/Surg) and 1 year administrative experience - at the community college level - but not much else.  Her MSN (from U Phoenix) is &quot;Generic&quot; (whatever that means!), and her doctorate (also from U Phoenix) is in Management/Organizational Leadership.  Despite this doctoral focus, she shows no particular contributions to or involvement in organizational leadership.  She has only a handful of presentations, and none are at a national level.  Her one publication is not research-based … and am I reading the title correctly -- &quot;A model for leading TELECOMMUTERS???&quot;  I wonder what that is all about, where that interest came from, and how that relates to her future work.  She has no funding, no research other than her dissertation, no grant proposals under review (or reviewed and not funded), and limited involvement in professional associations (a 2-year stint [2001-2002] on the board of a chapter of the Critical Care Nurses group.  I do not see any great strength in this candidate and recommend we not pursue her.</Comment>

<Comment>This applicant holds a Master in Nursing (generic) and a Doctor of Management in Organizational Leadership, both from the University of Pheonix. Her nearly four years of teaching has been at the associate degree level; three years of practice; and about six years in some form of management position. Over the past year she has served as the Director of Nursing for a community college AD program; and during the prior year, she was the Clinical Resources Manager for the VHA for a year.. She has only one publication. And no grants.  I do not think she is a good match fort he ABSN program. Despite graduating with honors from her BSN program, not sure her experiences have adequately prepared her to-date for the high demands of the ABSN students. I would recommend passing on her.</Comment>

<Comment>The reviews indicate to me that we would be hiring this woman to support her in developing her research program and to teach her to teach..While I think we have some latitude to do that at the MS level, I don&apos;t believe we can or should do this at the ABSN level. Lastly, while what she does with her personal life is her business, I am greatly concerned that she believes she can give these two areas justice while commuting regularly. Sigh..</Comment>

<Comment>I found Dr. Bei Wu to have a very strong CV commensurate with a senior research scientist. Her interenational experience is in China, a site of emerging DUSON interest. Her major strengths include:
1. A strong program of research in geriatrics conducted internationally (primarily in China) and domestically. Her current area of interest relates to oral health of older persons. Previously , she has done studies pertaining to selected chronic diseases, care givers burden, LTC, community-based care, dementia, economics of elder care, among others. The eclective nature of her interest in geriatrics offers multiple linkages with aging work currently occurring in the Caribbean.
2. She has 9 currently funded research projects in excess of $2,000,000; 3 projects under review; and completed 31 projects between 1991 and 2009.
3. She has an extensive list of 59 publications, including 6  manuscripts in review/revision or in-press. She is first author on 31 of them. She has mostly international collaborators, but US ones as well , including at least one at Duke.
4. She has progressed through the academic ranks. Her most recent appointment in 2009 was at UNC-Greensboro (tenured Associated Professor), but she continues to simultaneously hold appointments as adjunct, research fellow, and clinical associate professor at other institutions, including UNC-CH, the University of West Virginia, and a number of Chinese universities.
5. Has presented multiple scholarly papers.
6. Has a strong teaching record,mostly as sole instructor in gero, cultural diversity, and survey methods courses.
7. She holds a host of professional affiliations.

This is a very strong candidate that should be considered for an interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Seonah Lee is a relatively new PhD, who completed her degree in 2009 at the University of Illinois Chicago. She is currently in a post doc at UIC with Dr. Beverly McElmurry (of global acclaim).  All other education occurred in Korea. She has 8 years of teaching experience, all in Korea. Also, she has 9 first author publications between 1998 and present, six in Korean journal. Her cover letter offers particular insight into her research interests, accomplishments, and ambitions.  I was struck by the practical nature of the  topics that frame much of her work; really seeking to solve everyday challenges of nurses and their workflow. I was also intrigued by her interest in community based workflow and interest in working on interdisciplinary teams. I found her interesting but would yield to the perspective of those with a more indepth understanding of infomatics.</Comment>

<Comment>A strong practitioner as an Acute Care Nurse Practitioner  with expertise primarily in the emergency department.and neuro intensive care.  Anticipated to complete DNP in September 2010. Strong academic background. Currently is a clinical affiliated faculty at DUSON. Her e-mail cover letter seems to reflect more interest in teaching and the use of technology than translational work suggestive of her degree. There was not a sense of her research interest . I was not very impressed with this application.</Comment>

<Comment>This is a young scholar who clearly is focused in her research interests.  Her work related to clinical information systems and their impact on workflow and the implementation of EBP is relevant and important.  Her mentor - Dr. Bev McElmurry - is a nationally known leader, and I would assume that Dr. Lee has learned much &quot;at her elbow.&quot;  Her 7+ years of teaching (FT &amp; PT) has all been in Korea, but it is relevant teaching experience nonetheless.  She has not practiced in the US, so if she were to have any teaching assignment other than Informatics, that could be an issue; but she must know enough about the practice arena to be able to identify significant problems related to workflow and EBP … and then study them.  She has an impressive publication record, particularly for a new PhD, and her letter of interest is well-written and focused.  If those with more expertise in Informatics see strength in this applicant - and if we have not already filled the position - I would support further pursuit.</Comment>

<Comment>A DUSON MSN grad who is currently completing her DNP at Duke (expected September 2010).  Strong clinical background, particularly in emergency/trauma/acute areas; worked as an NP for 15 years.  She has been a clinical affiliate at DUSON for 11 years, but there is no indication of what the nature of extent of her &quot;teaching&quot; experience here has been.  I&apos;m not even sure what a &quot;clinical affiliate&quot; is.  Is that a preceptor for MSN students?  If so, I would not particularly view that as &quot;teaching experience.&quot;  She has a nice publication (in 2007) in JEN, but her other (2006) publication sounds like it&apos;s a committee report.  Her involvement in ENA is impressive, with her holding many leadership roles, and the recognition she has received for her clinical expertise is impressive.  To be honest, I&apos;m a bit confused about why she is pursuing a faculty position when the program she is completing is a practice-focused one, but I suppose that&apos;s a question that could be explored should we pursue her.  I do not see this candidate as &quot;the best of the best,&quot; and would be inclined NOT to recommend pursuing her unless we are &quot;in a pinch&quot; and need someone to &quot;fill some gaps&quot; in teaching.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate&apos;s CV is extensive and impressive in many ways.  However, I found myself confused as I read through it.  First of all, I wonder why someone who was tenured at WVU left in the same year she was tenured and why she is now looking at a new position when she was just tenured at UNC in 2009.  I was disappointed that she did not speak to this in her material, as I find it a bit troubling.  Second, I do not understand how one individual can hold 6 &quot;academic&quot; appiontments at the same time, along with her Advisory Board role in China (which I consider to be &quot;service&quot;) and her role as a Senior Fellow at an Institute in Shanghai (which is not clear as to what it involves).  While she has been well funded and has two grants under review, the focus of her work is unclear … ranging from oral health and cognitive function in elders, to epidemiological studies of dementia, to cognitive and physical functioning of siblings in China, to a cost analysis of long term care services.  Most of the populations under study are the elderly, but I do not see a clear program of research emerging here.  She is a prolific writer, with 2 articles in revision, 5 under review, 3 in press, and many already published.  As for presentations, she lists many &quot;abstracts submitted,&quot; several accepted for presentation, and several invited keynote addresses.  She has been the sole instructor for 8 different courses, was nominated (in 2007) for the WVU SOM distinguished teacher award, and has been teaching courses (here and there) since 2002.  Her honors are impressive, and she is quite involved in professional service activities.  Finally, her letter is strong and well-written.  Despite these strengthsI do have two questions/concerns … (1)  She is not a nurse and has had no experience with a school of nursing.  Could that be a limitation in what she can contribute to the work of OGACHI?  (2)  It was my understanding that we said NO to another candidate because her international work was not in the Caribbean.  This candidate also has done no work in the Caribbean, and while I understand that we are hoping to &quot;expand&quot; our connections in the Far East, I thought we wanted someone who can help lead the &quot;gerontology initiative&quot; in the Caribbean.  Perhaps I need clarification on this.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Nash has recently completed her PhD in nursing (May) and is an adult NP with a 50% clinical practice and 50% teaching appointment at University of Louisville. Currently she manages a nurse run clinic for individuals working in the horse racing industry. She has experience teaching larger classes and would be comfortable teaching adult health content. She last taught this content to undergraduates in 2005 when she was a clinical instructor and guest lectured in the class room. Content area included diabetes, respiratory, and health promotion. When asked about innovation in the classroom, she stated that she is innovative because she in clinically current and can bring those experiences to the classroom. Her research interests are in risk reduction related to HIV and she mentioned Dr. Relf as someone she would like to work with in terms of developing her program of research. I explained the tenure and clinical tracks and she believes she would be better suited for clinical. She asked appropriate questions, had spent some time on our website and overall my impressions are favorable.</Comment>

<Comment>Talked with Dr. Bei Wu today.  She was in an airport, and we had many interruptions from announcements being made there, but we did have a good conversation.  It was sometimes difficult to understand her – partly because of the airport announcements and partly because of her accent – but she can be understood easily with a little extra bit of attention.  She was articulate, open, answered all of my questions honestly, and expressed a sincere interest in the possibilities offered by this position with OGACHI.

(1) I asked her about leaving 2 tenured positions … She said that she left WVU when her husband took a position in NC (in the Research Triangle), and while she is happy at UNCG, she is excited about the opportunities this position presents and would very much enjoy being able to focus more on international work.

(2) I asked her about holding 6-8 positions simultaneously and how she manages them … She explained that most of these positions are “in title only:” (my words, not hers) and do not require extensive investment of her time.  The appointments in China allow her to give presentations when she visits there and to work with colleagues there on research projects.  The Research Fellow position at UNC-CH also “keeps the door open” for collaborative projects.  And the faculty appointments at UNC-CH and WVU are there because she typically does a guest lecture or two at each school.  She obviously is able to manage all this and still maintain an active research program and strong international partnerships.

(3) I asked her about the transition from dentistry to nursing and how she would prepare herself to learn more about nursing perspectives and issues if she were to be in this position  …  She did not address that second part of this question, but in response to the first part, she talked about how her current and past work has helped her understand how many residents in long term care facilities have poor oral health … and how vital nurses are to solving that problem.  She talked about the need to better prepare nurses in LTC to provide better oral health to the elderly.

(4) I asked her to summarize her area(s) of expertise … She identified (a) international aging, (b) long term care, and (c) oral health disparities.

We talked about her current research activities and writing projects, and she reinforced what was in the CV.  Indeed, she is an active researcher and prolific writer.  She reported that she was in the airport on her way home after having been in DC for a few days, serving on an expert panel for NIH to review grants … an appointment that supports her expertise as a researcher and attests to the respect she has in that community.

Finally, Dr. Wu reminded me about keeping her inquiry confidential, and I asked about her preferences for next steps … meeting only with the Search Committee, or moving ahead with a full visit as soon as it can be arranged.  She was hesitant, so I asked if she would like to think about this.  She ended up saying she would go along with whatever we thought would work best, and would be happy with the 2-day visit if it can be worked out.  She will be in China between July 9th and August 8th.  

My conversation with Dr. Wu reinforced the Committee’s sense that she is a strong candidate for the OGACHI position, and I recommend that we move to the next step of a visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant has had an extensive career in corporate positions associated with the pharmaceutical industry/bio-medical informatics. He has expertise in and held positions pertaining to strategic planning, biostatistics and data operations, clinical data management, and clinical informatics. Has experience with Level I-IV clinical and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trials. He has held leaderhip positions in a number of industries to include managing partner, group executive director, and product team leader.  With the exception of one position he  held for 4 years, he has held many other positions, all lasting from 1-2 years. He has no teaching or academic experience and thus shows few experiences in common with the position description.  He has a long list of publications and presentations; is well connected with his  profession and held leadership roles in professional organizations for his discipline. He has good academic credentials holding a MS in Statistics, PhD in Measurement and Statistics, and a MBA.  I have luke warm perceptions due to lack of experiences in academic institutions including teaching. I am also concerned with his short tenure in most of his many professional positions.</Comment>

<Comment>I found it difficult to review this CV.  Some sections were in chronological order, and others were in reverse chronological order.  In many instances, I found myself asking what the candidate&apos;s role was in a project that was listed (e.g., the 8 &quot;demonstration projects&quot; listed under Professional Career and 2 funded projects listed under DUSON employment.  Nevertheless, the candidate has several strengths and other areas that are not as strong.  

She holds an MSN in Gerontological Nursing and has engaged in clinical practice, writing, scholarly projects, teaching, presentations, and professional association work related to this population.  Her focus on care of the elderly is clear, but I was surprised to see that her areas of research interest no longer include the problem of incontinence, which seemed to be such a specialty of hers for many years.  In addition, she expects to complete her PhD in December 2010. Her research interest include urinary incontinence; her disseration addresses heart failure in African Americans. This suggest her potential contributions to growing a focus on health disparities research, as well as continuing her interest in geriatrics.

This candidate is well-known to DUSON as a CI (a role she also held at UNC for many years), project team member, and co-author.  She has taught at both DUSON and UNC, but she has not had responsibility for a full course.  Her teaching has been as a CI or guest lecturer.  As a CI, she has collaborated with colleagues to develop an innovative project with DUSON ABSN students related to leadership, and she has presented on this project at DUSON CI orientation programs.

Her most recent national presentation (a poster) was in 2008; I am not certain who sponsored the 10th Anniversary Baccalaureate Education Conference at which this poster was presented.  Her international presentations have been primarily through OGACHI, with the most recent being in 2007.  However, she is a prolific writer, and she is active in several professional organizations.  Most of her publications are as part of a team, but she does have some single-author publications; most of the articles listed are in well-respected, peer-reviewed journals.

Finally, the candidate expresses a commitment to innovations in teaching, and to the preparation of new and advanced practice nurses.  She has taken courses to enhance her teaching competencies and plans to take the exam to be certified as a nurse educator.

I know this candidate personally and have some concerns about her ability to focus, be succinct, and allow the spotlight to shine on others.  However, she does bring the academic preparation and experience that are congruent with a clinical faculty position in the ABSN program, and I would support interviewing her if that is the recommendation of the Committee.</Comment>

<Comment>I know that Dorothy is a reference for this candidate, so I am hoping that her input can help me change my mind.  But a careful review of this candidate&apos;s material does not lead me to recommend that we pursue her.  Here is what I see as strengths and concerns …

Her MSN preparation is in Med-Surg, and she has taught and practiced in this area.  However, her most recent clinical practice ended in 1995, and I would question how current she is to teach in the ABSN program.

The research projects she lists do not have a clear focus, few have been funded, and none is more recent than 2000.  Her most recent publication is from 2004, and she has no publications in refereed journals.  Similarly, her most recent professional presentation was in 2000, and none have been at significant national or international conferences.  This candidate does not have a sustained record of substantive scholarly work.

She held certification in Nursing Administration, but that expired 15 years ago.  She maintains membership in 2 professional associations but has not been actively involved for quite some time.  Additionally, while she lists a variety of contributions to employing institutions, (a) she notes that she is presently serving on 2 committees at Clemson, even though she left that position in 2002, and (b) her only involvement in her current school is on the Nursing Department&apos;s Curriculum Committee, not what I would expect from a Full Professor.

She does have a total of 17 years teaching experience and has taught a variety of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Additionally, she has served on thesis and &quot;special problem&quot; committees (whatever the latter are!).  She has received several awards for teaching and curriculum, which support strength in these areas, but they were all local awards … none were from state, regional or national groups.

Finally, I was disappointed in her letter.  It&apos;s a &quot;history&quot; of going from A to B, but it offers no insights about her strengths or the unique contributions she could make to DUSON.  I do not see any real strengths in this candidate and would recommend that we not pursue her.</Comment>

<Comment>This is a candidate with extensive leadership, global and corporate experiences.  His academic preparation -- MS in Stats, MBA, and PhD in Measurement &amp; Stats -- would seem to have prepared him well for his roles related to biostatistics.  I do not see any formal preparation in Informatics, but he has served as VP of Informatics and Knowledge Management at Daiichi,a nd some of his publications and presentations focus on bioinformatics and data management.  

It seems that he has held most positions for more than a few years, which is somewhat concerning to me, and I wonder about his current position.  He just started (2010) as a Managing Partner in a business, and is now looking at our position.  What&apos;s with that?

This candidate has no teaching or academic experiences and has not been involved in research.  Additionall, though he has been quite involved in professional associations, there is no involvement (other than membership) in the one organization that would seem to be most relevant to an expert in Informatics, namely AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association).

I do not see enough strength in this candidate&apos;s CV or cover letter to warrant bringing him to the next step.  I recommend we pass on this individual.</Comment>

<Comment>This applicant has many strengths in nursing practice, education, and research in adult health settings and especially in geriatric settings. She has taught at UNC-CH and Duke for multiple years. She has clinical teaching, classroom teaching, and on-line teaching experiences and is credited with developing innovative teaching stratgies, especially in the continuing education sector. Her experiences seem to match the position description for the ABSN Adult Health Faculty. Beyond the ABSN program, she also brings strength in geriatrics. I agree with Terry that it was difficult with  the HRSA grants listed if she was project director or played an instructional role on another person&apos;s grant. In some cases, the PI was listed on several NIH pilot studies pilot studies; in other cases that was not found. Ms. Lekan has a good track record of publications and scholarly presentations and served on various faculty committees in the academic setting.  She has not completed her doctorate and suggest that her work will be completed in December 2010.  I think the applicant would be a good addition to the faculty and would fall in line right away with on-going geriatric research projects. However, she has not completed her doctorate. Others have not been appointed until doctorate completed. Is she close enough for further consideration?</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate has extensive experience in development and delivery of education to both patients and nurses.  She also has excellent clinical expertise in gero.  Like others her CV needs some reorganization and updating before it would be disseminated further.  Specifically I know she has presented more recently because we traveled to SNRS together last Feb.  She presented a poster.  I think she would be a great addition to our faculty.  She is a very hard worker and collaborative team member.  I think we should proceed as we would with other candidates that have not completed their doctoral work; plan to interview when defense date is clear IF the position is still available.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate does not have any experience teaching in an academic setting.  She has a certificate from Stanford in Clinical Biomedical Informatics, but would also like a Masters in Medical Informatics.  She has 6 references from Duke including Dr. W. Ed Hammond, Director Center for Health Informatics and desires to work with the medical informatics program.  Current position is focused on research to reduce health disparities which has given her access to the Duke community and the emerging expertise in clinical informatics.  Scholarship in informatics is limited and more like that of a PhD applicant than a faculty member.  She has clinical expertise in nephrology.  Unless I am missing something I think we should pass.  I know that Constance spoke to this candidate and was very interested in her based upon her telephone conversation.  However Constance did not have a copy of her CV.</Comment>

<Comment>This is the second informatics candidate that gave Meredith Nahm as a reference.  While I respect Meredith greatly, she is a PhD student in informatics rather than someone with academic expertise.  Like Dorothy and Terry I do not see this candidate as having a great match with the qualifications of the position.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate with an extensive history of teaching baccalaureate students and a number of teaching awards. Has been teaching Associate Degree students for the past 3 years and desires to return to Duke and teaching ABSN students. Limited scholarship over the past 10 years in terms of publications and I do not find that she published her dissertation work. No funding in the past 10 years. No signs of teaching innovation either in her cover letter or CV. Will defer to the committee for discussion and decision regarding next steps</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Gomes is young in her career and has progressed steadily in her preparation to become a researcher and faculty member. She has multile strengths and expertise: Psych/Mental Health, Adolescent Health, and Community Health. She has had a couple years of teaching and several years of practice, but most of her time has been devoted to continuing her education. She has had good mentoring by Dr.Loretta Jemmott in her Post -Doc training at Upenn and has a good number of first author publications and grants where she served in various roles. She shows qualities of leadership (nursing association; administrative roles), research productivity, and academic engagement. She is developing at a steady pace, is young with a long career ahead of her to develop her full potential, which seems quite promising.</Comment>

<Comment>These are comments based on a telephone conversation with Dr. Christine Hedges.     7-23-10

I asked her to talk about her professional career in relation to the major expectations in the position description: graduate education, leadership of EBP initiatives; and scholarly work.

Dr. Hedges has has a qunigue set of experiences in being socialized into evidenced based practice/care.. She has worked for a non-traditional health care system in central New Jersey, Meridian Health, over the past five years as a nurse researcher/nurse scientist. The health system&apos;s  EB initiative started five years ago when Dr. Bernadette Melneck (?) and other leading edge nurse scientists in EBP were invited to Meridan to teach the staff about the approach and to assist them in designing a framework for practice for their health system based on EBP.  

The framework was adopted and Hedges works with four other nurses in the promotion of the approach throughout the health system,. They have evolved an Institute for EBP where four topics have been nominated for the Institute to work on for problem solving. Dr. Hedges is not the leader of the initiatives, but a strong member of the team having been involved since its inception and engagded in the day to day EBCare work of the system and the Institute.

Meridian Health, in conjunction with Georgian Court University,  developed the first generic BSN program in the two county area. The nurse scientists with the Institute became the founding faculty of the school and are currently active faculty in the program now in its third year. The organizing framework of the BSN program is EB Care.  Dr. Hedges has only taught in undergraduate programs. However, she does supervise members of their health system&apos;s  staff who are enrolled in DNP programs  with their capstone projects. 

Her scholarship includes 5 data based publications between 2002 and present , plus two chapters in handbooks. She has no grants of her own. She and her colleagues have received HRSA grants on EBP and another grant to support simulation labs. All grants were department grants. There have been no NIH grants. 

Dr. Hedges is interested in moving to Durham because her son and daughter-in-law recently moved here and looking to be closer to them  as time passes.

Dr. Hedges has has very interesting experiences; however, they do not appear to rise to the level of expectations as defined in the position announcement. Low on leadership of EBP initiatives; lower than expected on publications and granting activities; and no teaching experiences at MS or PhD levels, other than supervision of a capstone project.</Comment>

<Comment>MS&amp; PhD in Biomedical Informatics, as well as a Clinical Elective in Medical Informatics through NIH … well-prepared to work in informatics.  Current position has him (?) involved in research related to improving electronic communication to prevent disgnostic &amp; treatment errors, as well as research related to using alert notifications in outpatient referral process.  Only one research grant listed (co-investigator) … $250K from VA … but it&apos;s relevant (i.e., &quot;alerts re-engineering&quot;).  Several publications (though I am not familiar with the journals), 3 articles accepted for publication, and 5 manuscripts submitted (with him as lead on 3 of them).  He has presented at AMIA and other conferences on EHRs and other &quot;informatics&quot; topics.  Membership is in relevant organizations (AMIA and HIMSS).  Well-written letter.  I recommend we follow up with this candidate, provided the H1B Visa status is not of concern.</Comment>

<Comment>Seems like a most viable candidate.  Appropriately credentialled with some good experiences.  I note that her MSN does not have a clinical focus and wonder if that would be an issue in NC, were she to teach Psych in the ABSN program.  I also note that she has held no position for more than 1.5 years, and while I understand that she has been a student for most of her career to date, I am a bit concerned about so many &quot;short stints.&quot;  Also, she indicates holding adjunct and CI positions, but it is unclear if she has ever held a FT faculty position.  The 2005-2007 appointment at Hampton is listed as &quot;faculty member, research assistant, and learning resource director&quot; so it&apos;s hard to know how those responsibilities &quot;played out&quot; over the 18 months she was there.  She is involved professionally (holding the position of president in the VNA district #4) and has served on committees and advisory boards of other institutions (e.g., Maryview Medical Center and Old Dominion U).  Given the focus of her research, I was surprised to see that she was a member of the National Black Nurses Association for only 2 years, and that such membership ended in 2007.  Her research focus is clear, and she has published on relational aggression in well-respected journals and presented posters at national conferences; her presentations (other than posters) have been only at local conferences (i.e., those in the institutions where she was a student or staff).  She has had several P-20 grants; the status of the other &quot;grants submitted&quot; is unclear, though I would assume they were not funded.  One concern -- if she were to come on board to teach Psych in the ABSN program -- is that she has had no clinical experience since 1999; in addition, it is not clear that any of her clinical practice was in Psych.  Her letter is well written.  I recommend we follow up with her, despite some questions and possible concerns.</Comment>

<Comment>Interesting candidate. Extensive clinical experience, primarily in Psych.  Certified in Adult Psych and Adult Psych NP, which is congruent with his MSN and post-MSN preparation … the focus is clear and consistent.  Anticipates DNP in August 2010, but do not know if there is a defense date set.  Has held several teaching appointments (in addition to serving as a preceptor), but it is unclear if any were FT.  Has several publications, but none since 1999, and none seem to be &quot;scholarly&quot; in nature.  Two small grants (2001 &amp; 2006) to study postpartum depression and caregiver burden.  Has presented Psych area of focus at International Society of Psych Nurses (2005) and American Psych Nurses Association (2006 &amp; 2010); all others are local or regional.  Actively involved in professional associations.  Would seem to be a qualified candidate for the Psych ABSN position and, if all is progressing as planned with the DNP, I recommend we pursue.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate holds an MSN in Nursing Education and an MA &amp; EdD in Education.  She has held several faculty positions (FT, CI, and &quot;visiting&quot; to teach online courses), though none has been for more than 4 years.  Has taught online as well as F2F, and taught Community Health, Health Promotion, Adult Health, Research, and a graduate course with a fascinating title (&quot;Transforming Nursing Roles:  The Educator Administrator and the Socially Sculpted&quot;) … I wonder what it&apos;s all about, and I wonder what experience she brings to such a course since she has never been an &quot;educator administrator.&quot;  I must admit to being totally surprised about the courses she has taught, in light of all the work she has done (NC Children &amp; Youth Branch, and CA Childcare Health Program) related to child care.  I fully expected her to have taught Peds!!!  She has some committee experiences at the SON and institution level.  Her publications are weak, though the 2007 chapter is most interesting.  There were some areas of confusion regarding her publications -- (1) the first one says 2009 and 2008, and the first one listed as &quot;under review&quot; says 2007 … could a 2007 manuscript STILL be under review?  She has no grants and no research, and her national presentations are limited.  She is active in her community.  I read her cover letter after going through the CV and was totally surprised to see that she is applying for a position in the DTNI.  I do not see that at all.  If that is, indeed, what she is interested in, my recommendation would be NOT to pursue, as I do not see that she is qualified for that.  If she were to be interested in ABSN teaching, I would consider exploring that, though (in all honesty), I&apos;m not sure I see the integration of educational preparation, experience, and areas of teaching.</Comment>

He is two years out of his PhD from the same program as Constance’s (School of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Texas Health Science Center.)  He also had the same mentor as Constance.  He has several publications but only 3 first authored.  Several first author pubs are under review that appears to be from his dissertation.  Area of research is highly relevant and fundable.  Has some experience with graduate education as a teaching assistant.  I have shared this CV with Constance who feels he is a very good candidate.  I recommend we conduct a telephone screen and reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>I agree with Terry that this appears to be a good candidate.  He has significant clinical expertise and scholarly activities and publications in the practice area.  He has a very wide area of mental health expertise.  He has six publications, but it is not clear if they are all peer reviewed.  He has teaching experience as a clinical preceptor and has taught end-of-life content online.  He has also applied for a NP position with the Duke APN department.  Kerry Harwood forward his CV to Terry Ward.  Terry also feels he is a good candiate.  We would need to clarify his defense date and plans for clincal practice, but I think he is a good canditate.</Comment>

<Comment>An all around strong applicant. Hold MS in Adult Psych/Mental Health and MS as Adult Advanced Practice Psychiatric NP. Anticipates the completion of DNP in August, 2010. Has  substantial clinical practices as psych nurse and as APRN in Psy. Also teaching experiences in 3-4 institutions of higher education. Well established in the profession. A modest list of publications. No grants, although co-investigator on one grant and part of a collaborative research project. Seems worthy of a telephone follow up.</Comment>

<Comment>The teaching strengths of this applicant seem to be in community health/health promotion with a focus on children. Most of her appointments in academic settings have been of short duration, many less than a year. She has also more oftern been an adjunct faculty as opposed to a full time faculty. I sense a few red flags. Actively engaged in the profession. Was not aware that  we were searching for another community heath faculty; do not seem to need another faculty in Nursing Education at this time. Consequently, do not feel there is an open position for which she might be considered.</Comment>

<Comment>I did a phone interview with Dr. Esquivel on August 9th.  He talked (with excitement and passion) about his work in Informatics, particularly telemedicine, where he evaluates the technology used, manages a lab (where they develop protocols and teach healthcare providers how to use the equipment), and is quite &quot;hands on.&quot;  For his PhD, he studied the coordination and communication that did and did not happen when, using telemedicine, outpatients were referred … what information is critical to share, and how significant the EMR is.  He has always been interested in education and wants to be a teacher.  He described himself as articulate (and he was!), comfortable with technology itself, able to use technology in real-life situations, and interested in exploreing system changes.  He is a qualitative researcher who loves ethnographic studies.  He is currently involved in work related to image processing, especially via telemedicine, and studying if smaller files (that have less intensity of images) &quot;work&quot; to make diagnoses.  He has hosted students from Mexico at the U of Texas and designed a summer experience for them that included Informatics courses, projects, and interviews with experts and researchers in the field.  He talked about convincing the UT admininstration to incorporate iPods and iTunes to support student learning, and leading efforts on that campus to help faculty across all 6 schools use the iTunes platform … an initiative that called on his administrative, technical, and negotiation skills.  He has been a member of several research teams and learned much from that, but now he wants to take the lead on research studies and be more independent as a researcher.  He is &quot;absolutely&quot; interested in teaching and believes his work with master&apos;s and doctoral students (during and since his own time in the PhD student role) have helped him develop skills of teaching, mentoring and guiding others.  In addition, he has co-taught courses (e.g., interface design and intro to health care Informatics) and has completed courses in educational theory.  He is a member of the regional Board of HIMSS and has responsibility for supporting their online platform and their newsletter.  Dr. E was very articulate, passionate, and a delight to talk with.</Comment>

<Comment>I interviewed Dr. Gomes on 8/15/2010 by phone at her home in Suffolk, Va. She is a post-doctoral student with the T32 at the U Penn School of Nursing. She expects to return to class later this month and will complete the post-doc in May, 2011. 

In the interview, she was enthusiastic and excited about Duke faculty possibilities. While at Hampton University (2004 - 2008) she had classroom and clinical teaching responsibilities in psych, community, pediatric and adult health nursing. She also has taught Psych at Hamptom University. Psych nursing is  the focus of her research program around inter-group violence and  social behavior among adolescent girls (verbal and physical aggression). Currently, she is developing a K proposal around this topical area (which she plans to take with her when she finishes the post doc at Penn, spring, 2011).  If she joins the DUSON faculty, Dr. Gomes anticipates commuting from Suffolk to Durham each week (something she currently does between Suffolk and Philadelphia each week for her post-doc program). Her current mentors are Dr. Loretta Sweet-Jemott and Marilyn Summers at Penn. 

Note: Loretta Sweet Jemmott, PhD, FAAN, RN, van Ameringen Professor in Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing, and Director of the Center for Health Disparities Research University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing is Dr. Gomes primary mentor at Penn but she responded to my email query saying that while she would be honored to provide a reference, she will be out of the country for the next several weeks.</Comment>

She holds a DSN and MSN in maternal child health which fits the needs of the ABSN program.  She has several scholarly publications.  Although she was at UAB for a long time, she has only been at University of South Alabama for one year and is now looking for new opportunities.</Comment>

<Comment>This is an experienced teacher who expresses a passion for undergraduate education, a commitment to the scholarship of teaching, and a desire to promote excellence (e.g., through her work with the Nursing Honors program at UAB).  Her direct clinical experience is old (1975), limited (1 year only), and not in MCH, which is where her graduate clinical specialization is; however, she notes that she has been teaching didactic and clinical throughout her 35 years as an educator, and one would assume that she maintains currency regarding clinical practice through her work with students.  She has functional preparation in teaching, has received several teaching and mentoring awards, has published and presented at national/international conferences on education topics, and has developed elective courses to meet student interests.  I must admit to being surprised that -- with her graduate specialization in MCH -- she is not a member of any MCH professional organizations, nor is she published in MCH journals, though she is a most active member of professional associations and is active in her community as well.  Her funding record is scant with only a few small grants, many of which are from UAB or other local institutions.  Additionally, the research she lists seems to have no clear focus.  This lack of clear focus also is evident in her list of publications (several focus on teaching/education, many focus on child health, some address critical care issues, and several are MCN related) and in her presentations.  She has extensive experience advising/mentoring master&apos;s and doctoral research, serving on SON and university committees (including appointment to 4 university committees at USA, despite being on faculty there for only one year), and participating in curriculum revision work.  Her letter is well written and conveys her interest in teaching (particularly students in an accelerated program).  Finally, I know all of the individuals she lists as references, and all are highly respected scholars (particularly Roy) and scholar/educators (Morin and Horns).  Despite what I&apos;ve identified as some limitations, I think this is a strong candicate whom I recommend we pursue through a phone screen and reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>An experienced FNP (20+ years) who has been in that practice role in various settings - occupational health, family practice, schools, the ED, and hospice.  He also is an experienced educator, primarily (and most recently) in the online environment, holding FT and PT teaching positions for a total of 14 years and teaching both FNP and Education courses.  He describes himself as an expert in online course development and implementation who has mentored other faculty as they move into the online environment.  His letter describes several innovative teaching approaches - implementation of PBL in the FNP curriculum, use of simulation, and &quot;transitioning the FNP program from traditional methods of teaching … to one of innovation and student-centered strategies.&quot;  He has been involved in School and university committees at the U of Maryland (including Preceptor Recognition &amp; Retention, Strategic Planning, and Evaluation of Using Boyer&apos;s Model for Merit &amp; Promotion), and he is active professionally, with significant involvement in NONPF and AANP, as well as service on the MD Board of Nursing&apos;s Advanced Practice Regulations Review Board.  His track record of grants is weak, and he reports no research completed or in progress; however, he has an evolving record of clinically-focused and education/teaching-focused publications and national/ regional presentations. This candidate would not seem qualified for a tenure track position, and I would not expect him to pursue a research trajectory, but he seems qualified for a significant teaching role with scholarship being focused in the area of teaching and/or clinical practice.  I recommend that we pursue him and conduct a phone screen and reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Evolving professional who brings 15 years experience as a Psych staff nurse and more than 10 years experience in teaching positions; however, the latter have all been as a CI, TA, guest lecturer, or adjunct faculty member.  She has no FT teaching experience and has not had responsibility for developing or implementing a course, advising students, working in the academic environment, etc.  Were she to come on board, she would need a good deal of mentoring to be successful in a FT teaching role.  She is beginning a research career, having served as an RA and co-investigator on &quot;usponsored research&quot; projects, a co-investigator on a sponsored practice project (though I am unclear just what that means), and engaged in a post-doc at Hopkins.  She has published several book chapters and has one manuscript in review and one in press, both of the latter being in peer-reviewed journals … one having a clinical focus, and the other having an education focus.  She has one local and one regional presentation, and has submitted an abstract to an international conference.  Finally, she serves as Treasurer of the IA Psych Nurses Association.  This would seem to be a candidate who has potential, and I see no reason not to proceed with a phone screen and reference check.</Comment>

<Comment>I was excited to read this candidate&apos;s material because it documents a long and strong history of FNP practice, recognition of his advocacy on behalf of NPs through the AANP State Award for Excellence, and some experience in the academic world.  This candidate knows DUSON and has been a guest lecturer, seminar leader and clinical preceptor for us.  He also was an Assistant Professor at Emory for 2 years, where he taught a variety of primary care courses.  He is a member of the AANP but holds no other current memberships. Although he is not active in this organization, his work with CCNE (evaluator, elected Commissioner, elected Executive Committee Treasurer and then Vice Chair) is most impressive and speaks to the talents and credibility he brings to the accreditation process.  This credibility and recognition also is highlighted by his being accepted into the Duke Institute of Genomic Sciences and Policy educational programs … the first nursing doctoral student to do so.  His consultations, presentations and service within an academic institution are limited, and he documents no research other than the DNP project currently underway; however, his letter speaks to three manuscripts being in the final editorial phase prior to submission.  One final comment  …  I find the focus of his DNP work -- determining what constitutes EXCELLENCE in an NP&apos;s practice -- fascinating and think the concept could be extended to help us think about what excellence really looks like in other areas of practice, as well as in education.  Upon confirmation of his plans to complete the DNP, I would think this is a candidate we would want to pursue.</Comment>

He is familiar with our programs, policies, and processes.  He is an active clinician who would bring his clinical expertise to the classroom.  In addition, this candidate is very well connected with CCNE serving multiple terms on the executive committee of the board of commissioners.  He has received multiple honors including a recently receiving the AANP Award for Excellence.  Although he is a DNP student, I believe we should communicate with this candidate and strongly consider him for a FNP faculty position.</Comment>

He has national and international presentation experience.  He is actively involved in his professional organizations.  Although he does combine his teaching role with clinical practice, he does appear to spread himself a little thin with a full time teaching position and several part time positions.  He does have a few clinically relevant publications.  A phone interview is recommended.</Comment>

<Comment>I am left with a highly positive impression following my screening call with Dr. Buckner.  She is quite experienced and remains enthusiastic and dedicated to undergraduate students and teaching.  She wants to be in an environment in which she can engage in educational research to improve teaching and help to develop and implement evidenced-based teaching/learning/practice with the BSN level students.  She has a scholarly approach to teaching--talked about pedagogies and evidence for best methods.  She would provide significant leadership and guidance to junior faculty in these areas.  Her teaching expertise is in maternal newborn/child and pedicatrics but has recent experience in community and less recent experience in med/surg and fundamentals.  She is a Duke Alumnus.   I am enthusiastic about Dr. Buckner and recommend that we arrange a campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Shelly Eisbach was open, honest, clear and able to articulate her enthusiasm and sincere interest in a faculty position at Duke. Obvious candidate has spent time exploring DUSON via the web and other sources. States, “DUSON has a commitment to nursing education, cutting edge research and prestige in the nursing community” Also states, “NC is beautiful.” Verbalizes a passion for teaching which dates back to initial teaching role 10 years ago. Discusses a number of roles in psychiatric mental health nursing education to include lecturer to as many as 100 students, teaching assistant and clinical instructor. “I have always enjoyed teaching.” The candidate describes the use of a variety of teaching strategies to include group discussion, role play, case studies and lecture.  Candidate’s primary teaching focus has been in children and adolescents with mental health disorders, but manages adult parents and adults with mental health disorders in the context of research. The candidate uses terminology which demonstrates she has sound knowledge of mental health. She values her post doc experience calling it “My most significant accomplishment”. Describes work experiences in which she has collaborated with others and been an effective team member. Expresses a desire to continue collaborate with others who have interest in mental illness, children and adolescent behaviors. The candidate states the reason she is seeking to leave Hopkins is because there is not a clinical track. States “I want to be in a place where I can continue to use and develop my teaching skills.” States she enjoys her research and plans to continue her program of research, yet her passion is education and teaching. Her practice, research and teaching experiences have developed her mental health experience and she has a BA in psychology.
Goals included engaging in the development of course lesson planning, community interactions to facilitate student learning and collaboration with others on clinical research.
Scholarship may be viewed as limited but she verbalizes commitment to it. 
Candidate has limitations in work processes associated with the academic community, such as curriculum evaluation, course development and committee processes and work in academic community.
Will conduct reference checks within 1 week, if they are OK recommend a campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone interview with Dr Distler today went very well.  Here are some of the highlights of the conversation.  He is currently at South University teaching on line and is practicing at a small allergist practice.  He feels like he is working a great deal in isolation and wants to come to a large medical center/school of nursing where the resources are abundant and the collaborative opportunities are rich.  He would like to combine teaching and practice.  Although he is an FNP his expertise is in allergy/ asthma.  States he is probably in the last 10-15 of his teaching career and would like to come to a top university to end his career &quot;on a high note&quot;.  He is very passionate about teaching both in class and online.  Very well versed in adult learning theory (i.e. Knowles).  Passionate about developing and delivering high quality online educational product and engaging students utilizing adult learning principles, problem based learning, etc.  Interested in the work that has been done here with virtual learning environments (i.e. second life) and expanding that work into the Advanced practice nursing programs.  Has experience in faculty governance on various levels.  Inquired about the qualifications for academic rank.  Was able to discuss Boyers theories on scholarship very well.  Although he does not have a body of research he is very interested in exploring collaborative opportunities with the Duke allergists.  His publications reflect his clinical expertise as well as his experience with problem based learning.  I have reached out to his references and hope to speak with them in the very near future.  Barring any unforseen problems with his references, I would consider a campus visit for this candidate.  My initial sense from speaking with him on the phone is that he would be a good fit for DUSON.</Comment>

I do not see her as qualified for the other 2 positions she suggests in her letter -- EBP/Implementation Science or Researcher.  She notes completion of the doctorate (PhD I assume) at UNC in May 2011.

Has extensive teaching experience and has received several excellence awards for it.  Has taught a variety of courses, many of which were to large groups.  Has progressed through the ranks on a Clinical track throughout her 17 years of teaching and has had some involvement in governance and the full scope of the faculty role.

Obviously an expert in her field, as evidenced by extensive presentations at national conferences, publications (though there are none since 2008), being named to an AHRQ Expert Review Panel, and invitations to develop/teach a lecture series for AANP and to teach at a specialty conference for primary care NPs.  Has maintained an active practice throughout her teaching career and her doctoral studies and notes (in the letter) that she established 3 practice sites … 2 at UNC and 1 at Duke.

Although this is no bias against UNC itself, I often wonder about individuals whose entire educational history and majority of practice history have been at the same institution.  I wonder about openness to new ideas and ways of doing things.  All of her education is from UNC, and except for a short &quot;stint&quot; in the Cardiology Clinic at Duke (at which time she was still connected with UNC), her practice experience has all been at UNC since 2000.  Can one get too comfortable being in one system for so long?  :)  :)  I wonder.  :)  :)

Overall, it seems to me that this candidate is quite viable for the ABSN position, and I would recommend we proceed to a phone interview and reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>I must admit that when I saw such a short CV and short letter … and then (now my Northern biases are showing … isn&apos;t that awful?) that she lived on Wild Turkey Lane … I thought, &quot;Oh, this is probably not going to be too strong of a candidate.&quot;  But I was pleasantly surprised.  This individual has a most interesting and diverse background of experiences that, in my opinion, would bring perspectives to our faculty that do not currently exist (as far as I know).

She holds a DNP with a focus in forensic nursing and is engaged in many professional practice activities and consultations that fit with that focus.  She is an FNP who had been (but no longer is, as far as I can tell) certified as an Emergency/Primary Care NP.  She has been an FNP since 1996, opening one occupational medicine center and two family practices, one of which she owns and operated.  She received the 2008 NC NP Award of Excellence from the AANP and is extensively involved in community projects, many of which relate directly to her expertise in nursing.

Her presentations are limited in number, but they have been to diverse audiences -- radiology technologists, forensic nurses, and law enforcement/legal groups -- and all &quot;match&quot; her expertise in forensic nursing.  She has some classroom and online teaching experiences with NP students, but this is limited in time (i.e., 4 years total), and it&apos;s unknown just how much responsibility she had (e.g., was she primarily a guest lecturer, or did she have full responsibility for courses?).  She is a member of but shows no active involvement in professional association. 

I&apos;m disappointed that she did not use her letter to tell us more, but it seems she is someone worth pursuing.</Comment>

<Comment>A viable candidate for the OGACHI position, though research funding record is weak, which might be problematic, given the intent of this position.  She has had a PhD since 1999 and in that time has had 5 grants, but all have been very small.  I wonder why she has not been more successful, given her focus on the elderly, cultural diversity, and health disparities ???

She has solid teaching experience (9 years as a FT faculty member, and 1 as an adjunct), and her letter expresses a clear philosophy about teaching.  She has taught in MSN, BSN and ADN programs … taught a variety of topics … and taught in on-campus and online formats, and she has been involved in committees at the school and university level.  She has not been actively involved in clinical practice since 1993 (and that was in Taiwan), but I do not think this would be a weakness for the OGACHI position.  And while she is an active journal reviewer, she indicates no other involvement in professional associations.

She has a consistent record of refereed publications, as well as a few non-refereed ones and a few book chapters, and she averages 1 presentation/year.  Most of her presentations have been at the Gerontological Society&apos;s annual scientific meeting, which is great since it&apos;s a national conference … but I wonder why she has not reached more broadly to present her work?  I do not know anything about the Hispanic Health Disparities Research Center, but being named a senior fellow in that group sounds impressive to me.  Does anyone know about it?

Although not every aspect of this candidate&apos;s application shines at 100% (in my opinion), I do think she is worth pursuing.  I would, however, be interested to have Dorothy&apos;s input.</Comment>

<Comment>CV and letter of interest demonstrates a solid record of teaching and scholarship. Focus on aging and cultrual diversity support initiatives of OGACHI. Teaching background support ability to teach across programs. Demonstrates potential to meet expectations of position with the exception of limited funding or attempts for larger funded projects. This triggers questions regarding abilities in area grants and funding. Appreciate open honest comments regarding previous interest.</Comment>

<Comment>CV demonstrates she could contribute prospective of professional practice in NP program with potential of developing a relationship and creating a clinical site for students. 
Her role as founder and owner of clinic demostrate her passion/stakeholder prospective in preparation nurse practitioners. 
Has taught in classroom and online, however formal teaching and scholarship are limited but reference check can reveal true skill and level of expertise. Recognized by NP community for excellence in practice. Not sure where expertise in abuse/violence fit into program need.</Comment>

<Comment>CV demostrates a candidate with all the qualifications needed for faculty position in ABSN program. 
 
Very strong, teaching scholarship and service. She has been recognized for her excellence in teaching and has experience in faculty governance, curriculum and student advisement. Maintaining practice as NP. No questions that past experiences would support her success in ABSN program, but unsure about other positions in which she expressed interest . Question for me is candidate has been at clinical assistant professor level for 7 years. Wondering why Duke, why now??</Comment>

<Comment>While he is not known to me, Mr. Blessing appears to have a long standing relationship with DUSON  serving as adjunct faculty and preceptor. He demonstrates commitment to educating future nurse practitioners. His publications and scholarly presentations demonstrate his knowledge and expertise in the area of acute care nursing care. Since he is newly DNP prepared we need to explore from others who know him his fit for the organization and potential to be further developed. Would be great for guiding NP students to DNP program as role model planning and implementing a career plan.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Blessing has been an adjunct faculty and clinical preceptor for about 10 years in DUSON.  Completed the DNP at Duke in May 2010.  He has 9 refereed publications (none first authored) and three first authored book chapters.  Does not mention any formal teaching other than preceptor role.  For service he listed that he was Co-chair for Second Annual Summit for Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Summit, Durham, NC.  No other service listed.  13 years of experience as acute care NP in neurosurgical ICU.  
Assessment:  Good practice experience for this position.  He is a brand new DNP graduate so it is yet to be seen how this will change his practice and scholarship.  He has indicate no formal teaching experience.  Since he has worked with us for a long time we should interview him but I think we should assess whether he is the strongest applicant for the job.</Comment>

<Comment>I was turned off by the terse letter and a typo on the first page of the CV but after reviewing further I saw some things about the candidate that are interesting. The most important thing she might bring to us is her business experience.  Given the direction of our strategic plan, she may be able to contribute.  Beyond that, she  appears to be fairly junior with no indication of scholarly interests.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate has formal teaching experience at DUSON as a contract faculty member as well as a clinical preceptor.  He has limited experience in the other facets of the faculty role (i.e. governance).  He is an expert clinician.  Although he is a new DNP faculty member, he does show a fair amount of potential.  He has done international work in helping to develop a NP program in Germany.  He does have a fair number of journal articles/ book chapters.  Would be happy to interview him and check references.</Comment>

<Comment>In her CV I see very little indication of scholarly work.  She is a relatively new DNP with no publications and some presentations.  I see very little academic experience.  Although she is a FNP, I am confused as to her fit with the needs of the FNP program.  The idea of the candidate having been a business/ practice owner is appealing and would certainly fit with the strategic plan.</Comment>

<Comment>I had a face to face interview with this candidate today.  He interviewed well and think his personality would be a good fit with the DUSON culture.  He has assisted with HRSA grant writing, has been a co-PI for clinical research at DUHS, and has published.  He has certainly demonstrated clinical expertise and leadership as an advanced practice nurse in acute care and neurosurgery.  His areas of teaching passion include acute care and neurology for nurses/ APRNs.  Although his prior research has been primarily clinical research, his future research interests include outcomes research evaulating various teaching methods.  He has completed his DNP here at Duke so he does have some knowledge of DUSON.
He clearly articulates his strengths being his clinical expertise and his weakness being his lack of faculty experience and lack of formal preparation for the faculty role.
His short and long term goals as a faculty member are to improve his abilities and competence as an educator, to grow the ACNP program, and to increase the programs visibility and ranking nationally.  He spoke about identifying mentors at DUSON to work with him in growing as a faculty member.  He was not very clear about specific strategies to grow the ACNP program or improve the national rankings.  He also states that he would like to continue practicing in addition to being an educator.  He would also like to continue building his international relationships with advanced practice nursing training in Germany of which he was instrumental in developing.
Although this candidate is an expert clinician, has published and has been involved in clinical research, my big concern with this candidate is that he is a novice educator with no full time faculty experience.  I am unsure that he has a full appreciation for the scope of the faculty role outside of teaching.
Since he has taught for DUSON as an adjunct faculty member, I would be interested to view his evaluations and speak with lead faculty who have worked with him.  From this interview and looking at his CV I believe he has the potential to be successful as a faculty member in the clinical track.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone interview.  Applicant is interested in Duke mainly for two reasons.  She is interested in participating in conducting research and sees Duke as research intensive. She has had NP employees from Duke who were good representatives of the outstanding excellence of our programs.  She wants to work fulltime but currently lives in western NC.  It sounds as though it may be a couple of years before she could relocate her unless her husband would get a job here sooner (currently looking).  He is an assistant school principal.  Applicant has a high regard for distance learning—sees it as providing opportunities for nurses to advance even if living in remote areas.  She has done online teaching and enjoys it.  Her practice specialty is primarily pediatric (although an FNP).  She has done evaluations of child abuse and is listed on the child medical examiners list in Chapel Hill.  In terms of research, she is interested in the health and emotional sequelae of child abuse.  She indicated that her strengths were that she has had diverse clinical experiences and has been a nurse practitioner since 1981.  She also sees herself as disciplined an able to set and meet priorities.  Weaknesses she mentioned is that she may need to be living at a distance at least initially and that she may be too accommodating to students.</Comment>

<Comment>Mr. Toles training, background and experience make him an optimal candidate for the position. He has 5 years of teaching experience with a focus on psychiatric mental health nursing with ABSN and Master students. He has a post master certificate as a psychiatric mental health CNS and has 5+ years in clinical practice as an APRN with a focus on psychiatric mental health. Demonstrated the potential to develop scholarship as he has 2 published journal ,with 3 others under review.Additionally he has participated in a number of scholarly presentations. He is known to us and has served as a teaching assistant in the ABSN mental health course in the past year. Would recommend moving this candidate forward for further review and visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Orsini has clinical and teaching experience in psychiatric mental health nursing are impressive. While her experience was not in ABSN education, her CV demonstrates she has appreciation of psychiatric mental health nursing practice, prelicensure education and clinical currency. She also demonstrates the ability to translate nursing concepts to students and is able to develop and create innovative learning experiences for student learning. Think her experience with simulation and technology would be a plus to DUSON and ABSN program. Scholarship is limited with no publications, or national presentations , however she has been active in scholarship on a local level. This leads me to believe if she were in an environment where she was scholarship were nurtured and more highly valued she could produce. Interesting there is not mention of her dissertation topic or reseach topic in her documents. Would like to move forward with telephone screen of this candidate.</Comment>

He has been funded by the Hartford Foundation to support his dissertation research.  He has 3 published manuscripts (2 first authored) with 3 other manuscripts under review.  

He has clinical expertise in psych mental health and families.  Hold a Psych CNS degree  Taught the psych mental health assessment and diagnosis course to MSN students for two years.  And taught the Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing course to ABSN students for one year.  Mr. Toles was the course coordinator for both of these courses.  He has also precepted and mentored pre-licensure and graduate nursing students.   I think he would be a very good candidate for the psych ABSN position and would support a campus visit.

Mark has a FNP masters and clinical experience as a family nurse practitioner.  He practiced as an FNP at the Kalihi-Palama Health Center for 4 years.  While his teaching experience has had a psychiatric focus, the two years’ he taught assessment and diagnosis for psychiatric conditions should translate well into teaching FNP students.  I think he would be a good candidate for the masters FNP faculty and would support a campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Sabol presents as a highly qualified teacher and clinician. Her CV demonstrates academic preparation and clinical practice which will support her role as faculty at DUSON. She demostrates scholarship thru professional presentations at local and national conferences and a number of first authored publications. What impresses me the most is that she demonstrates the skills and abilities in coordinating and developing curriculum which will allow her to support the future changes which will be needed within the the DUSON MNS-NP program by 2013. Recommend we move fast on getting her screened and on campus for a visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Orsini&apos;s has substantial teaching, however, it is in a community college setting.  She also has substanital practice experinece in pysch mental heath.  These stengths are offset, however, by her doctorate completion being in Dec 2011 which does not meet out timeline.  I suggest that we have Ms. Orsini contact us again closer to completion of the doctorate.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Yap has accomplished much in her brief career.  She is teaching, conducing funded research, and is leading the Occupational Health Nursing Program, which will involve substantial course revisions.  It appears that she is taking a multi-focal approach to the RWJ study aimed at reducing decubitus ulcers in nursing homes.  She also has work (with supporting publications) on using tailored messages for health behavior changes.  Either research program sounds promising and I am not clear on where she plans to develop the future research.  Pursuing either emphasis area, she would find colleauges at Duke.  I recommend that we intervew her.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate is applying for both the FNP and ABSN (psych) positions.  In my opinion, I believe his best fit would be with the ABSN program based upon the clinical and teaching experience described in his CV.  He does have several presentations, a few journal articles and abstracts.  In addition, he does have some evidence of funding.  He states he has less than one year till completion of his PhD.  Since he is a DUSON PhD student, he is know to our system and he is familiar with our school.  He is a local candidate and would be interested in interviewing him.</Comment>

She was well liked by the students and peer observations of her work was very positive.  Her scholarship is limited.

<Comment>Dr. Derouian is currently an assistant professor at DUSON teaching in the FNP and PNP programs.  Her letter does not clarify why she is asking to apply for a position teaching in the ABSN program.  She has been an ANP for 10  years.  Because she does not include ending dates for her employment roles, I cannot determine whether she has been a ANP at Southern Pines for 10 years??  If not, has she had active practice since 2003?  She has been teaching at Duke since 2003.  Little evidence of scholarship.  I do not see anything in the CV that makes this candidate outstanding.  Perhaps a phone screening would clarify her strengths.</Comment>

<Comment>I conducted a screening interview with Mr. Toles.  He is very enthusiastic about the opportunity for a faculty position at Duke.  His passion lies with teaching psych mental health content to either ABSN or masters students, but he feels that given his FNP background, he can expand his current teaching repertoire to include that content as well.  He enjoys teaching and prefers an interactive approach rather than lectures.   Mr. Toles&apos;s area of research in transitional issues with nursing homes is not only very significant to nursing practice but timely given the national health care agenda.  He has a well thought out plan for his program of research.</Comment>

<Comment>I conducted the screening interview with Mr. Scott.  As a practicing FNP for over 20 years Mr. Scott describes himself as being at a point in his career where he wants to devote the majority of his time to educating practitioners for the future.  He has been a member of the board of commissioners for CCNE for 5 years and as such has significant insight into the curricular issues and future of NP education.  His prior teaching experience at Emory has included being the course coordinator of the Primary Care of the Adult course, a lecturer about women’s health content in the Women’s Health course, and preceptor/discussant for clinical groups and individual students.   He is currently analyzing his data for his DNP project titled “Aspiring to Excellence: Nurse Practitioners and Stories from the Field”.  His paper will be completed by the end of this semester and he will be completing his written exams for his program in January.  He is on target to graduate in May.  It is Mr. Scott’s hope that the work from his DNP will help him develop not only competence, but excellence in practicing NPs and students.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Lekan has a passion for teaching demonstrated by her career of education with both patients and nurses.  Ms. Lekan was very energetic and enthusiastic about teaching ABSN students.  Since submitting her materials Ms. Lekan has had the two articles that were under review accepted for publication.  One of these articles in which she is first author, addresses clinical leadership development in ABSN students.  Ms. Lekan wants to be able to educate pre-licensure students while developing innovative teaching strategies.  She also wants to continue her research and work with research teams.  Her dissertation work will be a secondary data analysis and she is currently submitted chapters 1 and 2 for her proposal.  She has a goal of graduating in May, but recognizes this will take significant effort.  Despite her limited formal teaching experience, Ms. Lekan was able to discuss the challenges and opportunities of educating ABSN students.</Comment>

She has a number of publications and presentations to her credit. Her program of research is well on its way and demonstrates that it is fundable and sustainable.

<Comment>Candidate&apos;s CV demonstrates she is a viable candidate for the position. Has extensive teaching and experience in statistics. Demonstrates the ability to use and teach statistical methods to students and support research processes and statistical needs of faculty. Her funded research at the National level is impressive. She has taught for DUSON in the past and has a working relationship with other schools at Duke. This has resulted in funding acquisition and publications. I noticed under software that she does not mention SPSS. Don&apos;t know if this is an oversight. But in my limited experience this software is commonly used by statisticians and nurse researchers. Should explore her previous performance at DUSON and move forward in the process if her previous teaching experiences were positive.</Comment>

<Comment>I conducted the screening interveiw for Dr. Derouin.  She has been both a student and adjunct facutly member at Duke for years.  Following completion of her masters program she has served as a preceptor for numbeous PNP students and has guest lectured in the graduatte pediatric programs, extensively in the PNP program.  Her return to school for her DNP was for the purpose of having the oppportunity to be fully engaged in the education of new nurses and NPs.  She speaks of loving the two years she taught the ABSN Pediatric course.  She described the ABSN students as both challenging and delightful.  In a faculty position, she is seeking an environment that will allow her to grow professionally.  While she feels she has been able to significantly contrbute to the school as a clinical associate, she would love to be a full contributing member of the Duke faculty.</Comment>

<Comment>I received a reference for Dr Blessing late last week from Dr Barbara Turner.  She has given Dr Blessing a very positive reference stating that he thinks like a scholar, he is a very well respected clinician and is a known educator here at DUSON teaching part time for our ACNP program.  She has also mentioned his international work in establishing an advanced practice program in Germany.  She believes he is a hard worker, will fit in well and will most likely be a long term hire.  She gave some obvious negative comments stating that, although Dr Blessing has taught here part time at DUSON, he certainly does not fully know the faculty role and that he would need mentoring with respect to learning and fully appreciating the scope of the faculty role.</Comment>

<Comment>I spoke with Beth Stewart, Director of Advanced Practice, at DUHS on Friday 10/29/2010 regarding dr Blessing.  She has know and worked with Dr Blessing through the medical center and believes he is a very effective and passionate clinical educator and clinician.  States he is very well respected by his NP/PA and physician colleagues at DUHS.  She believes his clinical expertise will serve him and his students well if we choose to hire him as faculty at DUSON.  He has a strong work ethic and is very personable.  

Negative comments that she had include a lack of experience and knowledge of the full scope of the faculty role.  Mentions that he will certainly need mentoring to learn the additional work faculty do aside from teaching students.  She has also mentioned that he sometimes gets overextended with his commitments and then does not fully invest in the non-clinical work he is involved with (i.e. committee work, meetings, etc).</Comment>

<Comment>I have interviewed Dr Valerie Sabol today.  During the interview I got the sense that she is a very dynamic individual, we had a great conversation and the 1 1/2 hour on the phone with her flew by in a wink.  She is currently the director of the acute care NP program at University of Maryland.  She loves the balance she has with teaching (80%) and practice (20%).  She would like to continue to teach and practice if she comes to Duke and did mention that she would love to expand upon her doctoral research studying anemias.  She has great experience in the classroom as well as teaching online and using clinical simulation.  She described some wonderfully innovative ways she is using unfolding case sudies and video taped clinical simulation with her grad and undergrad students working together during her acute care courses.  She referenced working with Dr Barbara Resnick as her montor while at Maryland.  Her area of teaching passion includes clinical type courses including physical assessment, acute care didactic/clinical courses, pharmacology, patho, etc.  She was very articulate, excited and engaging.  

From this interview I get a sense that she would be a very good match for this position.  I believe she would fit well in the Duke culture.  I believe her experience and her forward thinking innovative ideas would be an asset for our advanced practice program in general.  I will check her references ASAP.  Anticipating positive references, I would fully recommend further recruitment of this candidate and inviting her to campus for a visit.</Comment>

<Comment>This was the initial phone contact with Dr. Yap.  She described several activities that she is currently involved in such as directing the Occupational Health Nursing program (National Institute of Safety and Health Education Research Center grant) and her activities in curriculum revision.  She also talked about her RWJ foundation grant for research on reducing nursing home pressure ulcers.  She also teaches several courses a year.  When I asked what she was looking for in a move to Duke, she responded that she wanted a more research intensive environment.  She is interestedin expanding her research in the area of long term care and we mutually determined that there is a match between her research interests and the current research at Duke.  Where she would fit for teaching is less clear because we do not have an occupational health nursing program.  I am very enthusiastic about this candidate being a good fit with the research intensive environment at Duke.</Comment>

<Comment>Kerr:  This applicant will be a Duke DNP graduate.  She has been working with Dr. Price and wants to continue working with her as a mentor.  Ms. Kerr has significant experience as an FNP in practice since 1983 with an emphasis in school health.  She has several presentations and one publication (referred--may have been more since they were all listed together, it is difficult to tell).  She also has an article in press and a book chapter accepted.  I would be interested in learning more about this candidate.  She seems to have possibilities for our program, particularly if we want someone in school child health.</Comment>

<Comment>Nolan:  This applicant is a not a nurse.  She has a 2006 PhD in Policy Analysis and management with two masters (clinical research and epidemiology).  She has strong research training with a visiting research fellow at the Center for Child and Family Policy at the Social Science Research Institute at Duke University and a completed postdoc at DUMC.  Her research has a theme in severe mental illness but she has done various studies in this area including weight management, religiousness/spirituality. She is also interested in cultural influences, racial/ethic health disparities and cross national research.  She seems to have the makings of an interesting researcher, particularly if she can focus. However, I do not see anything in her materials to suggest that she would be able to fill the role of the EBP, implementation science position.  I do not recommend bringing her here to interview for the EBP position.  However, I wonder if there is another place for her at the School.</Comment>

<Comment>Chein:  This applicant had several years of experience consulting with UNC School of Nursing faculty as a part time statistician.  I would like to hear what the nursing references have to say about him and also perhaps check with others who we know at UNC.  His publication record appears strong for his career stage.  However, since completing the PhD in 2009, he has held two positions.  This is a red flag that we need to explore carefully.</Comment>

<Comment>Min:  Dr. Min appears to have started her career as a physician in China followed by computer science degrees in the US in 1999 (MS) and 2006 (PhD).  This is an interesting combination of interdisciplinary education which raises my interest in her.  She would be a junior faculty member but has accomplished an appropriate level of research productivity for her career stage.  I suggest  doing a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Cheng, Eric:  Dr. Cheng finished a PhD in 2001 but has not had significant research productivity with only 4 papers published.  He has significant teaching experience in classes with large numbers of students.  His research area should be a fit; however, he has held four positions since completing the PhD in 2001.  This is a serious concern that in combination with low productivity in publication and grants, dampens my enthusiasm for this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>On November 10th, I conducted a phone screening interview with Dr. Mustillo.  (By the way, her name is pronounced as it is spelled .. Mustillo … not with a Spanish flair [i.e., not Musteeo].)  While at Duke, she served as the Stats expert on projects in departments of Psychiatry, Sociology and Divinity.  She enjoyed that work but wanted more interaction with students, so she moved to Purdue.  Increasingly, she is expected to be a PI, but that is not what she loves to do, even though she has been successful with grants.  She loves the challenge of figuring our how to design a study, how to analyze data to get answers, how to run models and &quot;play&quot; with the data, and working with teams.  She has received a teaching award each year she has been at Purdue and loves teaching.  She is looking for a position where she can teach Stats, consult with research teams regarding the Stats component, and be involved in working with others to develop grant proposals.  She also wants to be involved in the life of the School and university.  She describes herself as flexible, upbeat and energetic.  And throughout the conversation, she was able to explain her Stats work in &quot;normal&quot; language, not trying to impress me with her in-depth knowledge.</Comment>

<Comment>I conducted the initial phone screening interview with Dr. Song on November 17th.  (By the way, her first name is pronounced Lee-shin.)  She told me that she moved to the US because of personal reasons … a close friend died of CA, and she needed some new perspectives on life.  In China, she was involved for 7 years in an international collaborative project where she did the evaluation regarding curriculum needs and launched the first distance learning program; she was not involved in any policy change efforts.  She also was a faculty/clinical mentor in China and attended workshops on teaching.  She has served as a peer mentor for doctoral students here in the US, and (during her post-doc) has worked with MSN students on their research proposals/posters.  While at Michigan, she developed clinical guidelines for heart failure patients.  When I asked her about EBP, she talked about (a) using evidence to underlie her own clinical practice and (b) research (as if she saw the 2 things as the same).  She asked many questions about the DNP and did not seem familiar with that kind of program or DUSON&apos;s program in particular.  She was not able to describe any &quot;leadership of EBP and implementation science initiatives,&quot;: as is called for in the position description.  Dr. Song describes herself as curious … someone who likes to explore lots of different things.  Her language was a bit of a challenge but not problematic.  Finally, she told me that she does have offers from other places.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Kerr has over 25 years of clinical practice as a nurse practitioner with a focus in children and women.  She has cross-cultural experience and mentions strong afflitation with Dr. Price in her development as a doctorally prepared pratitioner. She has numerous presentations at a national level and has actively working towards strenthening her publications. She is currently working on her DNP but does not state what the focus of her project. Her only teaching experience is as a clinical/didatctic instructor from 1986-2001. It is for this reason I would not recommend this candidate at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Chien demonstrates experience as biostatistician in health and human research. 5 years of experience with UNC school of nursing demonstrates ability to support faculty and school of nursing research.  No formal teaching but demonstrates the ability to support student learning through teaching assistant roles. Established scholarship through publications and presentations. Experience with Chinese public health is also a benefit. CV demonstrates this is a viable candidate. However, experiences seem to all be under the &quot;guidance&quot; of others. Recommend telephone screen with exploration of potential to function independently.</Comment>

His area of research interest, design and evaluation of computer applications to support learning, decision making, and problem solving among both health care consumers and providers, appears to fit with that of several of our facuty and students.  He has some teaching experience.  Depending on if Constance believes he is prepared well in informatics, I suggest we consider his application further.  He has an R21 under review.</Comment>

She has participated in several research projects in clinical settings.  Her BRAAT study sound quite interesting and if she is planning to continue exploring geriatric syndromes such as pressure ulcers, she would be a good fit with Duke and would have many colleages on campus.

<Comment>Dr. An has no apparent formal education in informatics.  However, it is possible that informatics was the focus of her post-doc at NYU, which we could verify by phone.  She finished her Phd in 2005 and has had only 5 publications since that time which is low productivity, especially given that she had a post doc at NYU.  She has been involved in several small grants but it is unclear for which she was PI versus Co-I.  She has substantial teaching experience.  I do not recommend moving further with this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Reid:  Dr. Reid has a good amount of teaching experience in BSN and MSN programs.  She has one publication (not first author) and one grant currently funded internally by UNC W.  Given she finished you PhD in 2005, this is not good productivity and does not indicate potential for a research career.  Given her outstanding clinical experience as a women&apos;s health NP, she might make a contribution to the faculty on the clinical track.   If we have a place for a women&apos;s health NP, I suggest a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Ms. Kerr has over 25 years of clinical practice with women and children as a family nurse practitioner.  She anticipates graduation in May of 2011.  She has two published manuscripts and a manuscript and book chapter in press.  She is multilingual with several cross-cultural experiences.  She has numerous presentations but her only teaching experience is as a clinical/didatctic instructor from 1986-2001.  I question her as the best match for the FNP positions because we have numerous individuals that can teach the FNP child content within the pediatric faculty.</Comment>

I agree with Ruth that she might be a fit for a clinical track position however which one?  The only one I can think of might be the FNP position however I think a board certified FNP would be the best fit , not just a womens health NP.

<Comment>Although this candidate has solid experience as a NP in a wide variety of clinical settings over her career and is a DNP candidate.  She does not have a prior fulltime faculty position and only one prior adunct faculty position.  Although she does have a fair number of presentations, she only has one publication.  I think her international experience is notable and I could see potential for her to develop a closer working relationship with the MSN program and the OGACHI office.  In addition, she would be a nice supplement to the medical spanish courses already taught.  I think we should consider a phone screening.</Comment>

<Comment>The candidate is a 2005 graduate from Texas Women’s University.  Her research is focused on identifying strategies that individuals living with HIV utilize to self-manage and cope with their illness, in order to improve the quality of their lives.  She has not been very productive, but given she is in a non-research intensive school this may make sense.  She also looks to have had a very intense teaching load.  The candidate has extensive experience in women’s health from a L &amp; D nurse to over 20 years as a Women&apos;s Health Care Nurse Practitioner.  She has three years of teaching experience at UNC-Wilmington with pre-licensure and graduate students.   She has taught a variety of courses including Maternal Newborn to BSN students and Women’s health to FNP students.  She has one peer reviewed manuscript, one book chapter, and several articles in process. I would recommend a telephone screen.</Comment>

She has been teaching at UNCW for the past 2 years in Womens Health and has taught in some capacity since 1993. She has limited publications, but has a number of national and local publications. She has strong clinical practice in women health. Her research focus is HIV/AIDS and she has secured some funding to support her program of research. Her research focus in african-american women will support DUSONs academic priorities.

<Comment>This would seem to be a strong candidate whose only &quot;limitation&quot; is a sustained, active scholarly program.  Her PhD focus (Health Studies/Higher Education) and dissertation (CAI) seem relevant to a teaching role, and her MSN preparation is relevant to the practice component of the teaching role.  She has experience as a teacher of various types of students, has been involved in the broader scope of the role (e.g., SON and university committees), and has served as a clinical instructor and preceptor for MSN WHNP students, both of which enhance her understanding of student learning needs, etc.  Her practice experience is quite impressive, and she seems to have combined an interest in education with an interest in clinical practice -- &quot;introduced and integrated hybrid-online compoment&quot; of a program at TWU, &quot;developed Women &amp; HIV curriculum&quot; at TX/OK AIDS Education &amp; Training.  She has one 2008 article in a well-respected journal, but nothing more current; and while her published posters are current, they are from local events for the most part.  She does list 4 manuscripts &quot;in progress,&quot; but none have been submitted to date.  She has had some national presentations and several small grants, again from primarily local sources.  The recent Fellowship at U Michigan is impressive and fits with her research interests (which are clearly articulated in her letter), her service as a consultant to CDC is laudable, and the research study for which she is a co-PI sounda most interesting.  She keeps current by attenting conferences and is a member of associations that are relevant to her area of expertise, though she documents no involvement in those associations (e.g., committee member).  Although the scholarship aspect of her CV is somewhat limited, I would recommend we follow with a phone screes, as other aspects of her dossier are good.</Comment>

<Comment>Hua Min (Wa Ming) Dr. Min is currently serving in a biostatistician/bioinformatics joint program conducting pilot projects and prototypes examining existing data system and creating homogenous integration models for oncology databases. She has acquired funding from NCI through the Cancer and Biomedical Informatics Groups (caBIG). She describes her career focus in &quot;building a system that integrates data and utilizes current data systems to answer scientific questions and develop more advance techniques&quot;. She is interested in a teaching position because she thinks teaching is &quot;very interesting&quot;. She is interested in duke because &quot;Duke is a good school and I know faculty there who have similar goals as mine&quot;. She describes her strength as her medicine background. She was an internist in China and moved to the US in 1996 where she shifted her focus to computer science. She also identifies her research on data integration and translational medicine as strengths. She believes her weakness is being &quot;still at the beginning of my career and the need for more mentoring from senior researchers&quot;.
Her teaching experience is limited to being a TA from 2000-2005. In that position she taught undergraduate and graduate students (approximately 20) and databases and software engineering in face-to-face sessions. She is an active participant of the caBIG SIG and vocabulary data element workgroups. Other than that she does not have any affiliation with service organizations. It is in my opinion that her expertise is limited to oncology and oncology database management/integration.
Based limited expertise and teaching experience the recommendation is to not move this candidate forward.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Reid self-identified herself as an African American female from Tuskegee Alabama.  She finished PhD in 2005 and decided to work as a clinician to “recover” from her doctoral work.  She never intended to do “academia” and did not really have a good idea of what academia entailed, but she really enjoyed precepted teaching.  

As a student in her undergraduate program Dr. Reid was told that she would not be able to advance in her nursing career, and therefore she had viewed academicians as being very non supportive of students.   After 2 years post her doctorate she decided that she wanted to give academia a try because she enjoyed teaching and felt that it would help facilitate her research.  However, she did not really know the difference between a teaching and a research institution.  She decided to accept the position at UNC Wilmington because both the Dean and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs were African American and could provide guidance for her as a new African American faculty member.  

After a couple of years at UNC Wilmington Dr. Reid understands that she needs a more research intensive institution if she wants the support the conduct of her research. She has been in contact with Dr. Barrsso since coming to NC, and feels that Duke will be able to support her in her scholarship as both an educator and researcher.  Currently she teaches 3-4 classes per semester which makes it difficult to advance her scholarship.  This semester she is teaching advanced health assessment, a women’s health clinical course, and two sections of clinical reasoning.  All of these courses are taught online. She has also taught maternal newborn, research methods, and a farm worker health course.   She misses practice and would like to be able to engage in a small clinical practice.  

Dr. Reid is Co-PI for the HIV Nurse Network Wilmington location, out of UCSF, with over 1,700 women.   She has a manuscript in process from this data.  In addition, she has 2 other manuscripts from pilot work that she hopes to have submitted by the first of the year.  This scholarship was advanced in part through her acceptance in the a competitive process for the Interdisciplinary Emerging Scholars Network.  During this month long program at the University of Michigan she attended classes all day and was able to obtain assistance in the analysis of her pilot studies.  
Dr. Reid is seeking an environment in which she can advance the knowledge development related to self-care management of African American womens with HIV and educate nurses in the care of maternal newborn and women’s health care.
I recommend the continued recruitment of Dr. Reid and will proceed with her reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>I had a very nice conversation with Dr Alemi on Dec 9th by telephone.  He was very excited at the prospect of coming to work at Duke University.  He has a very interesting career.  He spoke about starting 2 companies with venture capital.  Unfortunately these two companies were not successful.  He was very passionate when he spoke of his work in translational research, applications of health informatics, and personalized medicine.  He speaks as a strong proponent of nursing, nursing research and collaborative interdisciplinary research.  He was extremely interested in the DTNI.  He was able to clearly articulate his approach to students and in the classroom.  He is enjoys working with masters and doctoral students, both in the classroom and on collaborative research projects.  He stated that he is likely to have an R21 proposal funded through the NIMH, states the proposal was ranked as a 30.  He will also have 2 VA contracts.  He anticipates being 40% funded for the spring.  He has noted that he is exploring other opportunities at universities, he may have an offer from another university soon, and was very curious about the process and speed that we will be moving forward with the hiring process.

In short, I recommend moving forward with checking his references.  I have reached out to the professional references he has provided for us and hope to schedule phone calls this week.</Comment>

<Comment>I met with Jill Kerr 12/13/2010 for a screening interview.  I was not very impressed with her answers and discussion about nursing education and being a nursing educator.  She is a current DNP student at DUSON with a defense date set for Apr 5, 2011.  She is interested in a FNP teaching position and is very interested in having a 50% teaching load and 50% clinical practice.  When asked why she wanted to teach she mentioned her nurse faculty loan repayment program, then after a little coaxing she mentioned that she had a lot of knowledge that she would like to pass along to NP students.  She has done some very intersting work with the school based health system and her DNP project is very interesting as well.  I am unsure that her work and expertise in school based health, early childhood and special needs children fits the needs of the FNP program.  When asked what she could teach or what she wants to teach she mentioned family planning, maternal child health, adolescent and child health, as well as epidemiology.  Her answers were very shallow when asking her about teaching/ learning, approach in the classroom, etc.  Quite frankly, I expected more especially from someone who has taken some nursing educator courses here at Duke.  I do not think that she has the breadth of current experience or knowledge in diverse populations across the lifespan to meet the needs of the FNP program.  I am interested in hearing feedback and guidance from the committee before I proceed with references.  She may be a fit for a position within the ABSN program (peds or maternal child health) - but not sure if that is a stretch.</Comment>

<Comment>12/14/10  …  Conducted a phone screen with Jina.  She is on track to defend her PhD dissertation in Summer 2011, but the U of Michigan does not set up defense dates until about a month in advance.  I told her of our practice of needing a confirmed defense date in order to move forward with the process for a candidate.  In light of this, I recommend that we do not proceed with checking references at this point.  However, I will comment on my discussion with Jina.

When asked what attracted her to our position, she responded that the focus on health-related issues she would find in a SON was very appealing.  She has been studying how a &quot;community&quot; can help a patient with diabetes deal with managing that illness, and being in an environment that shared the interest in health-related issues was attractive.  Of course, she also commented on Duke&apos;s reputation, etc.

Jina has &quot;taught&quot; for 4 years, but it was clear that the course was designed and all lectures were given by the FT professors … and her role was to lead discussion groups with students, and do an occassional lecture here and there.  She has never had responsibility for designing and implementing a course.  The courses in which she was involved focused on contextual inquiry (i.e., how organizations work, the systems it uses for communication and operations, and workflow issues), project management, information search &amp; retrieval, information processing models, and interviewing techniques.  She sounded quite comfortable when talking about these topics.

When asked about the unique strengths she would bring to our school, Jina indicated that she had looked at our website, including the Informatics courses and faculty.  She knows Dr. Johnson&apos;s work very well, and she knows Dr. Peace&apos;s as well, but to a lesser extent.  Jina believes that her expertise in human-computer action would complement the expertise of these other faculty, and her expertise related to adopting information systems in healthcare settings would align well with the focus of our program.

In terms of the mentoring/guidance she thought she would need were she to join the faculty, she identified a better understanding of nursing issues and practice (to put her information systems expertise into that &quot;real&quot; context) and of the culture of our SON and healthcare.  She expressed a desire to collaborate with nursing faculty on projects and in teaching.

This candidate sounded mature, confident but not arrogant, and passionate about issues surrounding human-computer interaction.  She has some publications and presentations, and seems to have strength in both the broad field of informatics/ information management and the narrower area of human-computer interaction.  When her defense date is set, I recommend checking references and if they are supportive, a campus interview is likely to be warranted.</Comment>

<Comment>I spoke with the candidate on December 14th for the initial phone interview.  He indicated he will be defending his PhD dissertation on January 7th.   The most appealing piece of our description for this position is the opportunity to collaborate with others, as that is what Mr. V sees as one of his strengths.  He has had experience working with a nursing school in India, providing Stats support to faculty as they developed research projects … working with them on research design and data analysis.  In that school, he was an Instructor, teaching Stats to master&apos;s students for 4 years and supporting students with their theses.

Mr. V expressed an enjoyment of working on teams.  He said he puts in a great deal of time and energy to get a clear understanding of the topic (i.e., &quot;what the essence of the problem is&quot;) and that &quot;people liked the way I handled it, working with them&quot; … though he was vague on this last idea and provided no further elaboration.

He has written NIH grants with faculty and reviewed the Stats sections of others&apos; grants.

In terms of his teaching, Mr. V indicated he has been the lead instructor for courses.  He says he focuses on concepts more than formulas and uses many examples to enhance learning.  He incorporates a great deal of &quot;hands-on&quot; experiences for students, as his goal is to train students to be comfortable with how to approach a problem and ultimately be on their own.  His greatest reward as a teacher is when students find they actually LIKE Stats.

When asked what he was looking for in a job, Mr. V responded:  50-60% collaboration, 25-30% teaching, 20% of my methodological work and extending my own research.  His doctoral study looks at recurrent data and missing data problems, and multivariate analysis.  He has focused on shaken baby syndrome and re-submitted a grant to NIH to study the implications of this problem on children (e.g., mental health, developmental).  This is a mult-country study.  In addition, he is involved in a project related to communication disorders in collaboration with a School of Medicine in India; he anticipates limited travel associated with this project but is likely to have to do some.

Mr. V was articulate, responded to my questions easily, and seemed most confident in his area of expertise.  I am checking references and will post them in the &quot;references&quot; section of the DB.  Provided all continues to be positive, I recommend we continue to pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Slaven-Lee is a board certified FNP.  She has taught NPs at Uniformed Services University for the past 1.5 years as an Assistant Professor.  She has practiced as a NP for the past 6 years and currently practices at a walk in clinic at the Pentagon while teaching.  This aligns perfectly with the needs of our FNP program.  She completed her DNP at Case Western in 2008.  Her research funding and scholarly productivity is a little light.  She does have one podium presentation at a national conference (NONPF).  She holds membership in several professional organizations but no leadership positions are noted on her CV.  Based on her CV, I recommend a phone screen with this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:     ALAATTIN ERKANLI                                      			 Position:  Statistician III

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Dr. Erkanli has been PI on one R01 and has been a co-investigator/statistician on numerous research grants.  He has been on several of Isaac Lipkus’ grants.  He has 50 publications that are typical for a statistician at this career stage.

B.	Focused program of research
His own interests in in developing robust Bayesian models for intra-class correlation coefficients used as an index of test-retest reliability of psychiatric screening tools.
    
C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Dr. Erkanli did not discuss any teaching experience other than that list being a teaching assistant on his CV (1988-1991).  Thus he does not have any teaching experience to support this job requirement.  

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
Professional service/leadership are absent form the CV.  He list being a member of two society, the American Statistical Association and the International Society for Bayesian Analysis .

F.	 Job stability
Good job stability.  He has been at Duke since 1991 and in one department since 1999.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
This candidate has the type of statistical training we are looking for. He has served as study statistician on many grants, including several with Dr. Isaac Lipkus.  Most important for this position is an expressed desire to assist faculty in statistical design and analysis.  However, he did not describe in his letter or other materials, his desires and approaches regarding providing statistical consultation to faculty and doctoral students for their research, teaching doctoral statistics courses, serving on PhD dissertation and DNP capstone project committees, and assisting with the development of grant proposals (conducting power analyses and preparing data analysis plans)—job duties stated in the position description.

I am left a bit cold after completing this primary review. My enthusiasm for this candidate is further dampened by the presence of numerous typos scatter through his materials.  It is possible that a phone interview would alleviate concerns about fit.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate has a lengthy CV and lots of experience, but I do not see her as a particularly strong candidate for either the Researcher or ABSN position.  She has had a PhD since 1988 and (in my opinion) has little to show for having that credential for 22 years.  She has been as Associate Professor at cincinnati for 18 years … I wonder why she did not apply for or was not successful in going for promotion to Full Professor?  If her research accomplishments are so stellar, she surely should have been promoted.  I also wonder why -- after holding a number of educational administrative positions (including Associate Dean for Academic Affairs) she went back to a faculty position … and is now interested in teaching ABSN students.

RESEARCH  …  I do not see that she has any significant funding.  She currently has a 5-year $1M grant from MIOSH, which is nice, and she has a $300K grant from RWJF.  However, eacof those grants has a different focus and shows no building of a clear program of research.  Her other grands are all small, and some are internal.  It seemed that the focus of her research is on workplace issues, and her letter says that her &quot;program of research deals with leadership behaviors, nursing culture, and role implementation of healthcare workers.&quot;  However, many of her publications and presentations focus on pressure ulcers (and other topics), so a clear &quot;program of research&quot; does not emerge for me.  Based on all this, I do not see her as a candidate for the Researcher at all.

TEACHING  …  She has extensive teaching experience in BSN, MSN, DNP and PhD programs, including dissertation committee member and chair.  However, I wonder what she would teach in our ABSN program that would help meet our teaching needs.  It seems we have faculty who can teach the leadership course, but what we need are people to provide leadership in our clinically-focused courses.  And I do not see her as a viable candidate for that.  She last taught Health Assessment in 2004, and the last time she taught Adult Health was in 1992 … hardly current to teach our students.  She does seem to have done some projects related to simulation and other technologies, her PhD is in Educational Administration, and she does hold an MEd (1980) in Curriculum and Instruction, all of which are strengths.  But I do not see her as being able to provide up-to-date teaching in a clinical course.

PUBLICATIONS  …  She had 2 publications in 2006, 1 in 2007, none in 2008 or 2009, and 1 in 2010; 2 are &quot;in press.&quot;  To me, this is not at all stellar for someone who has had a PhD for 22 years and who has been in an academic environment for nearly 30.  The titles of some publications suggest they are research-based.  Like her research, her publications also seem to be &quot;all over the place&quot; -- faculty turnover, pressure ulcers, academic climate, reimbursement, APRNs, nurse managers, shared governance, etc.

PRESENTATIONS  …  She seems to have been quite active with presentations at national and international conferences in 2010 and has 2 papers accepted for 2011.  All presentations focus on workplace culture/leadership or pressure ulcers.

PROFESSIONAL INVOLVEMENT  …  She has been involved in many university committees/task groups/initiatives, was active (until 1992) in her Sigma Chapter, served as a BON program reviewer in 2004 (nothing more recent), and has provided consultation (but not since 2000).  However, for someone who has been in the field for so long, I see no state or national leadership in professional associations or other similar work.

Overall, while this candidate has a lengthy career and CV, I do not see her as the best fit for our Researcher or our ABSN position.  I do not recommend further pursuit.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  This candidate is involved in 8 research projects at present, most of which are RO1s and funded by NIH/NIMH.  He is involved in 3 additional projects which are &quot;pending,&quot; and he has been involved in many other projects that are completed, including serving as the PI on a $2.3M grant from NIMH.  He does not describe his involvement in these projects, but I assume it&apos;s as a Stats consultant.  Despite this activity, his publications are a bit disappointing … He had 2 in 2005, 6 in 2006 and 7 in 2008, but then only 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009 and 2 in 2010.  He notes no manuscripts in review or in press.  Publications are in what seem to be well-respected journals, but the inconsistent record raises questions for me.  In addition, he has not given a professional presentation since 2004!

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  He identifies &quot;areas of research interest,&quot; but I must admit to not knowing enough about all of what he lists to know if they are &quot;scattered all over the place&quot; (i.e., he&apos;s &quot;interested in&quot; whatever is funded) or if they are consistent with one another.  Sorry!  Whether or not these areas are disparate or consistent, the reduction in publications and the lack of presentations do not support an active program of research, in my opinion.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  This candidate notes that he has been an Assistant Professor at Duke from 1995-2006 and an Associate since 2006, but I do not know if that means he teaches or if it&apos;s just a title.  He does indicate being a teaching AND research assistant in 1988-1991, but that was a long time ago …and it&apos;s impossible to know how much of that time was as a TA and how much as an RA.  Whatever it is, his teaching experience is practically non-existent.

RELEVANCE AND EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE  …  Not applicable.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  I see membership in 2 professional associations, but no dates are listed for those memberships (for all I know they could have expired in 1995!) and there is no indication that he has been involved in them -- or in any other professional service activities.  

JOB STABILITY  …  He had been at Duke since 1991 (in various departments/projects) and in the Department of Biostats and Bioinformatics since 1999.  There are no concerns about &quot;job hopping&quot; with this candidate.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION/MATCH TO DUSON  …  I do not know enough about his unique talents in Stats or the specific needs DUSON has regarding Stats specialization, so I cannot speak to whether or not he is &quot;the candidate&quot; to make a significant contribution to our work and help meet our needs.  I must say that for someone who has had his PhD for 20 years, I am not particularly impressed with this candidate.  Also, he says nothing in his CV or letter about wanting to work with faculty or graduate students, being part of a team, and so on … all of which are critical to our position.  I do not see outstanding strengths in this individual and do NOT recommend a phone interview.</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Outstanding publication record for career stage.  He did not list or describe any grant work either as a collaborator or PI.  

B.	Focused program of research
His research interests are in diagnostic imaging and microarray-based cancer classification.  I question whether this would translate to nursing science.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
One year of independent teaching of intro stats course.  Three years of graduate student teaching.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
He is early in his career.  Just finishing his post-doc.  He lists membership in five association but does not describe any service roles.

F.	 Job stability
It does not appear that he has held a regular job yet.  He has had teaching assistantships.  He does demonstrate stability in completing his education in a timely fashion.  

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
He has had about 2 years of experience providing statistical consulting to faculty and/or students, including psychiatry, dentistry, computer science, pathology, neurology, etc.  Conduct statistical analysis using various classical and advanced statistical tools, such as functional linear model, classification trees, linear mixed models, missing data imputation, and structural equation models, etc.  However, his research and statistical interests appear to be more closely aligned with laboratory science and imaging than with the type of research done in nursing.  He has no grants experience to date.  His fit with nursing is tenuous.</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
7 publications all appear to be prior to the PhD program.  Does not mention grant work although he has assisted with analysis of other’s data. 

B.	Focused program of research
He does not say much about what he expects his future independent research to entail.  His dissertation developed a robust approach for polytomous logistic regression which can be applied when data have mixed continuous and categorical covariates

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Served as a teaching assistant for courses such as Survey Methodology and Design and Analysis of Clinical Trials. In this role, he/she conducted help sessions and practicums, and taught several sessions, for example, weighting process in Survey Methodology, independently. Has also taught short courses to medical professionals in Beijing.  

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
None noted although member in three professional organizations.

F.	 Job stability
Good job stability.  It appears that he was in his Masters’ program from 94-97, completed in 97.  

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
The areas of statistical analyses and consultation that he has provided are a good fit with the types of studies done by nursing faculty at DUSON.  Longitudinal , epidemiological, logistic regression, clinical trials.  I am inclined toward exploring further with him through a phone interview.  However, he completion timeline for the PhD is ambiguous.</Comment>

<Comment>I spoke with Dr. Slaven-Lee this am for about 1hour.  She is very interested in a faculty position here at DUSON in the FNP program.  She is a Marine Wife, her husband was just transferred to Cherry Point Marine Air Station where he will be stationed for at least 3 years.  She has just left her faculty position and she has been living on base at Cherry Point for 3 days.  She is looking for a full time faculty position and hoping to begin as soon as possible.  She has taught at Uniformed Services University for 2 years and has thoroughly enjoyed the full scope of her faculty role.  She has been involved with the usual committee work (CCNE accreditation), student advisement, and course coordination.  She has taught health assessment, primary care of adults, clinical practicum, and coordinated a cadaver lab with 70 students and several assistant faculty.  She does have some excellent experience in working with high tech patient simulation in teaching health assessment.  We spoke about her limited scholarship - she explained that her DNP research has been accepted and will be published in the very near future.  She shared some ideas for clinically focused articles that she would like to get started on.  She explained that her pubs and presentations have been a little thin over the past two years mainly because she was really getting entrenched in and learning her role as faculty.  She was able to balance her teaching with limited clinic time seeing patients at the Pentagon.  Her past clinial practice experience would be a valuable addition to our FNP ranks.  She was owner of a private FNP practice in rural Maine.  This rural health experience and entrepeneural experience would be a good addition to our faculty as well.  She would like to continue to practice and anticipates doing this perhaps one day per week.  In describing her approach in the classroom, she &quot;does not bore the students with a lot of power points&quot;, she tends to weave a fair amount of story telling and sharing of her clinical experience into the content.  She describes herself as &quot;raising the bar high to produce a good NP graduate&quot; - she mentions that her active duty military students expect a &quot;good product&quot; from her as a faculty member also.  Although she is a member in her professional organizations, she has limited leadership.  She does sit on the board of directors for a non-profit that her family operates called Wreaths Across America - one project they perform is to collect donations to fund the distribution of several thousands of wreaths that are placed annually at veteran&apos;s cemetaries across the US.  

I think she would be able to hit the ground running, she would full understand what is expected of the greater faculty role, and she would be comfortable in the classroom.  My impression is that she would be a good fit as an FNP faculty member.  I will proceed with reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:      Jiaping Wang                                             			 Position:  Stat II
Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
He has not research funding which is appropriate as a new PhD grad (2009) and post-doc (2010-11).  He reports that he conduct an analysis that was to be part of a grant does not report first-hand grant experience.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
This applicant appears to value scholarship.  He is co-author on one “letter” (not sure if that is referred) and one article.  He lists 6 papers under review and 3 “manuscripts” which I assume are papers in progress.  I would expect to see a first authored paper or two given that he is a second year post-doc, however, I don’t know what is appropriate in his field.  

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
He has taught calculus and statistics.  He describes the students in his statistics as being in highly mathematical fields such as engineering so his teaching experience may not transfer easily.  He discussed in a statement, however, that he was able to adjust his teaching style for the calculus students because they did not have as strong a math background.   

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
None noted in the CV.  Lists no professional memberships but did present research at two meetings that appear they could be professional societies. 

F.	 Job stability
He has been in school and so data is not available.  However, he did complete his programs of study.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
His letter, and that of his advisor Dr. Zhu, says that he has consulted with faculty on their research.  However, the areas of consultation seem to heavily favor imaging type research.  He did not describe psycho-social measures such as those used in nursing.   I would want to talk with people he has consulted with to hear how he works with researchers.  Overall, however, his work does not appear closely aligned with typical nursing research methods and I do not recommend going further in recruiting this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:  Sheldon Darcy Fields                                                 			 Position:  Unspecified


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
I am very impressed with this candidates CV.  He has served as PI or CO-PI on 4 research grants with a total of nearly $2million in addition to some other unfunded research.  He has 11 published journal articles, 8 are first author.  This candidate also has many invited podium and poster presentations as well as workshops and plenaries.

B.	Focused program of research
He seems to have a focused program of scholarship.  His research, writing and presentations have primarily focused in the area of AIDS/HIV.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Sheldon’s teaching experience appears to be very solid.  Currently an associate professor of nursing at University of Rochester (2001-2011).  Has been a visiting professor at UCSF, and taught for one year at Binghamton University, NY.  He has taught primarily in Advanced Practice Nursing courses (physical assessment, primary care, pharmacology).  He served as co-coordinator of the FNP program at U. of Rochester.  He seems to be a good fit for our FNP position opening.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Sheldon’s clinical practice is relevant and relatively current.  He has practiced as an FNP since 1996.  While at U. of Rochester he balanced practice and teaching position.  He appears to have discontinued practice in 2009 at which time he was engaged in a RWJ health policy fellowship with Senator Barbara Mikulski.

E.	Service to the profession
Sheldon has evidence of service to the profession.  He is a member of many professional organizations with leadership positions at one time or another in almost all of them.

F.	 Job stability
Yes – has been at University of Rochester for past 10 years.  

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I think the candidate is clearly a match for FNP position opening.  I believe he would be able to contribute across programs possibly.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:            Sheldon Fields                                     			 Position:  Unspecified (FNP?)
Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
This candidate’s research productivity is not at the level that I would expect to see for someone at his career stage and who has completed a post-doc.  He has 9 referred publications but only about 6 are from research.  Of further concern, his research productivity appears to have slowed down rather than accelerating.  For example, one publication in year 2010, 2008, 2006,… with gaps.  The funding record is not equivalent to what we expect of our faculty at the point of tenure, yet he has had tenure since 2007.  He has been PI on a 5 year HRSA grant which appears to pertain to research of men of color with HIV.  He was also PI on a internally funded grant at UCSF during his post-doc.  He says little about the significance or impact of his work in his letter and it is not apparent in the CV.

B.	Focused program of research
His research is quite focused: his theme is HIV prevention strategies/programs for young men of color as well as developing models of care for those young men who are HIV positive

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Many years of experience and leadership in the FNP program at Rochester.  

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
He is a certified FNP and has been practiced in this role from 1995 to 2009 at which time he likely stopped because of the RWJ Fellowship in DC.  He has a long history of primary care clinical practice in community based federally qualified health centers in which he provided care to underserved minority populations with very complex health problems.  Also is certified as an Advanced AIDS Certified Registered Nurse.

E.	Service to the profession
Has outstanding service record to school, university and profession and has held national elected positions in Association of Nurses in AIDS Care.  He has several awards that acknowledge his practice and scholarship:
•	Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-Health Policy Fellowship  
•	Fellow of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners (FAANP)
•	National Academies of Practice (DPNAP): Distinguished Practitioner	 	

F.	 Job stability
High job stability.  Has been that the University of Rochester since 2001 with the expectation of a two year post doc at UCSF (2003-2005).

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
There are several areas in which he could contribute at Duke.  He has experience managing the FNP track at Rochester and has taught many years in that program.  He has research in of minority populations and may be helpful in the school’s efforts to expand research in this area.  His work in Rochester’s Center for Community Health may transfer to efforts in OGACHI.  He states he has success in recruiting, retaining, and completing minorities in the PhD program, which is something we need to increase here.

Recommendations:  The candidate is interesting in several ways as described in “G” above.  However his research productivity is close to what is expect of Duke tenured faculty and this I doubt that he would be a fit for a position here.  I do not believe we should go further with this candidate.</Comment>

Assisted with ABSN program for the past 1 ½ years in both foundations and women’s health.  Role has been primarily as a clinical instructor, but has also assisted Helen Gordon with the Maternal Newborn course.  Taught at New York University for 1 ½ years in both undergraduate and graduate coursework (health assessment, nursing foundations, nursing research)

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Ms. Stevenson has had a variety of women’s health experience including 7 years of experience in Labor and Delivery, over 1 year in a Planned Parenthood program, and 3 years in a reproductive clinic.

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Dr. Dungan has an impressive history of funding, pre-doctoral F31, post-doctoral Hartford and AHA, K-99. I am a little surprised at the number of publications given her grants.  4 manuscripts, 2 first authored, all appear to be data-based. 1 manuscript under review, and 3 in preparation.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors.  Dr. Dungan has a very fundable (evidenced by her record) of research with elderly and genetics

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
2 years of teaching experience as a TA at Florida in Nursing Foundations and Nursing Research.
Taught at Duke as both an instructor and co-instructor in the ABSN leadership course and the Nursing Research course.  Dori Sullivan is a reference, I assume for her teaching.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
1 year of clinical experience as a staff nurse.  Not essential for the researcher position for which she is applying. 2 book chapters related to cardiac care.

E.	Service to the profession
Member of several appropriate organizations.  Limited service outside of DUSON and previously at the University of Florida, but probably appropriate given her career trajectory.

F.	 Job stability—not an issue

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Significant match to CV research focus for the school.  Teaching experience is limited, but could probably teach across programs (ABSN, MSN, DNP and eventually PhD)

I would recommend a screen, reference checks and if positive an interview for a junior level researcher position.</Comment>

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Completing a post-doc at the University of Pittsburgh.  3 manuscripts,1 first authored, 2 data-based.  6 pubs under review or revision.  Limited funding history, but he may not have been eligible for NIH dollars.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
Research is focused on obesity, weight loss management for cardiovascular risk and diabetes.  This should be a very fundable area.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Limited formal teaching experience, but he has given several guest lectures related to epidemiological, EBP, and older adult health. Does not appear to have a BSN.  Does have a MSN.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Does not have any clinical experience as a nurse other than internship while in school in China.  Does not have a RN licensure.

E.	Service to the profession
Membership in appropriate organizations and has served as an abstract reviewer for several conferences.  He also has a history of reviewing for journals.

F.	 Job stability—Not applicable

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Research interests would match that of Allison V. and Constance J.  Would not be able to teach in the ABSN program, but could teach in other programs.

I would recommend a screen and reference check, interview if all positive.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate has applied for the Researcher position &amp; seems to be a qualified junior faculty for that position.  Her research focus is very clear, and she has received good funding to support it.  The focus of her work would seem to have the potential for additional and sustained funding.  She has demonstrated an ability to form interprofessional partnerships and work collaboratively with research teams.  Her publications are somewhat limited, given that she has had a PhD for 5 years, then had a post-doc for 2 years, and then had 2-3 years as a junior faculty fellow at Duke.  She has presented at several &quot;solid&quot; conferences (State of the Science in Nursing Research, International Society of Nurses in Genetics), though there are no presentations at national conferences since 2008.  She is active with poster presentations.  She has had success as a teacher here at DUSON, and she expresses an interest in teaching, though it&apos;s clear that her primary focus is research.  If she were to teach, it would not be in any clinical area since she has had only one year of clinical practice and that was back in 2001-2002.  If we are willing to recommend a junior person for the Researcher position (which does seem to be congruent with the position announcement),  recommend a phone/in-person interview to talk about her seemingly erratic presentation history, somewhat limited publications, and career goals.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
No funding reported in CV.  Has 1 2006 publication, another submitted in 2010, and 2 “to be submitted.”  Journals seem to be respectable ones.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Provides research statement that describes his experiences and accomplishments to date, and that outlines areas of interest for future research.  Particularly interested in survival analysis, longitudinal analysis, risk analysis, quality of life issues, and clinical trials.  Research program not crystal clear, but she does have a focus for continuing to advance her work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Worked at a TA in several different courses (N=5) and a “grader” in another course.  Has not had responsibility for developing/implementing a course and would need much mentoring in that.  She does include a thoughtful teaching statement that expresses an interest in learning how to teach and a passion about “finding effective ways to foster and sustain students’ intellectual growth.”

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Holds membership in 2 professional organizations, but documents no active involvement in them.  No other professional service documented.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Worked as RA on several projects, all of which were relatively short term.  The “jobs” she documents (researcher, associate, consultant) all are very short-term.  

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Particular statistical interests and expertise MAY complement other statisticians on faculty, but I don’t know that for sure.  I do not see any particular unique contributions, other than her cultural diversity.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
No research or funding documented.  3 publications – 2003 in Advance for Nurses; 2009 in Southern Online Journal of Nursing Research; 2010 in GA Nursing Legislative/Public Policy column.  1 more submitted in 2010.  These show an effort to put ideas “out there,” and 2 relate to care of patients with DM, but none are in highly respected journals, and there appears to be no exceptionally clear focus.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
None.  Completed DNP in 2009.  Expresses interest in “translational research related to diabetes and health disparities,” but no clear agenda outlined.  Additionally, no evidence in CV of expertise in health disparities.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
10 years teaching experience – 8 as clinical instructor and 2 with full course responsibility.  6 of these 10 years have been at Medical College of GA, from which she earned all 3 of her degrees.  Has taught a range of undergrad and grad courses, though none are acute care/Med-Surg types.  If that is our real need, this candidate does not seem qualified for that.  If our need is broader, her past experiences could be most helpful.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Clinical practice documented is staff nurse/case manager (89-95), staff development, interim director of clinic, coordinator for brain tissue donation program, and diabetes educator (2.5 years, 2005-08).  No experience in acute care, which could be an issue if that is where our ABSN teaching needs are.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Involved in her university; assume she is comfortable in academic setting.  Active with student organizations and in own community.  Involved in professional associations at state level and as delegate to ANA convention in 2002 and 2003.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Does not seem to be an issue

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
As noted, this is a candidate with teaching experience who would seem to be able to make a contribution to the ABSN program; however, her lack of acute care experience may be a concern and not meet our needs.  Need input from ABSN faculty/chair.  I suppose a phone call to the candidate to discuss these questions would be in order.</Comment>

One publication in Statistics &amp; Probability Letters (is that a refereed journal???), one MS accepted for Annual Institute of Statistical Mathematics (is that a refereed journal or an organization’s newsletter?), and several pieces under review, submitted, or “manuscript” (which I assume means it’s being prepared).  Overall, funding and publications are not particularly strong.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
While I do not understand all of his discussions about his work (and the formulas in his research statement made my eyes glaze over), he does seem to be clear about his research interests and outlines future directions.  It is not clear if his work to date or his interests are aligned with the kind of research done at DUSON, so this would need to be explored.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
His CV lists several semesters as an Instructor at SUNY Binghamton, and I assumed that meant he had full responsibility for the courses listed.  However, his teaching statement speaks only to his TA experiences, so it’s not clear what his role was as an “instructor.”  His teaching statement speaks to “training” students, “lecturing,” and similar concepts. It may just be a choice of words, but I wonder about his student-centeredness and his ability to truly engage learners.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
None documented.  Lists no membership in professional associations, abstract or journal reviewer roles, etc.

JOB STABILITY  …  
This candidate does not seem to have had a “real” job (except maybe the Instructor position already mentioned).  His “work” has all been in support of someone else.  It’s hard to know, therefore, how he manages his own workload, contributes to a work environment as an individual, and so on.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
This candidate seems to be well-prepared in Stats, and one of his references is most positive.  However, I do not see him as a particularly strong candidate who could contribute something unique to DUSON.  My recommendation is that we not pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term  The candidate will work to get R-00 funding to set up projects that would receive R-01 support over the next 3 years.  She also wants to get her research on track and build a strong program of research related to the intersection of genetics, cardiovascular problems, and aging (which is a unique focus/perspective in the nursing community).
Long term   She would like to be a “resident expert” in genetics on a faculty, guiding student research, developing and teaching genetics (and research methods) courses or providing leadership in integrating genetics through the curriculum at all levels.  She also aspires to assuming leadership roles in nursing organizations or other organizations (e.g., AHA) to advance genetics initiatives and to create a program in cardiovascular genetics for nurses in practice.

Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Not applicable

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
The candidate has been part of an interdisciplinary group during her training; the importance this group gives to the clinical impact of their work is very much aligned with the candidate’s values, and she would like the opportunity to continue working with this group.  She has already experienced the transition to a more independent role and would like to continue to be an equal, contributing member of the team.  She knows how progressive DUSON has been and is excited about its future.  She believes the DTNI could provide a strong link for her work.  Finally, she is award of the resources to help faculty be innovative and excellent in her teaching and sees that as strength in this environment.

What are your strengths?
The candidate believes that her training in interdisciplinary models of research to move the science forward is strength.  She has good networking skills and is able to “Broker” collaborations.  She is a perfectionist (e.g., especially careful with data) who is committed to doing science well, and she welcomes (and asks for) feedback and criticism that will help her do good science.  Finally, she believes that there is great potential for her work, and it clearly fits with Duke’s and DUSON’s agendas (e.g., related to health disparities).

What are your weaknesses?
The candidate expressed an awareness that her publication record is limited; although they were not offered as excuses, she reflected that her diligence often lengthens the data gathering and analysis process and the standards for accepting papers in the journals that are most significant for her work are increasingly high (e.g., expecting a single paper to incorporate multiple dimensions of studying a problem, rather than only one dimension).  She admits that while doing her post-doc she got involved in several projects that were not directly related to her work and realizes that figuring out the balance between being a team player and “protecting one’s time” is a skill that needs to be developed, along with learning how to better prioritize her time and how to negotiate other options when needed.

What is your most significant accomplishment?
The candidate noted that the thing of which she is most proud is the K-99 funding (she was 1 of only 2 nurses funded through NINR for this program).  Part of her success with this grant was the interdisciplinary perspective she brings and her ability to blend that with her “good science” practices.  “A close second” is the success she had in teaching N307 on her own, a course she completely re-vamped to better engage students and help them value research, not just learn the steps in the research process.

What is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online
The candidate expressed a desire to have the flexibility to be creative in her teaching to create experiences that help students value and appreciate what they are learning.  She expects high performance from students and expects them to be responsible for their own learning … and she found that students responded positively to this.  She indicated she could teach genetics, research methods, research utilization and, if needed, statistics.  She has a long-term interest in teaching in a PhD program but realizes she will need to be mentored to do that; until then, she would enjoy teaching at the undergraduate or master’s level.  While she does not see herself teaching in the clinical setting (having had no significant practice herself, even though she is an NP), she does envision creating some clinical modules on genetics, working with faculty to incorporate genetics into case studies they develop, and so on.  Finally, while she has recorded some lectures for an online course, she has never had responsibility for an online course and would need mentoring to be successful with that.

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Her research interests are noted above – the intersection of genetics, cardiovascular and aging.  She has clear ideas for an evolving program of research and seems well on her way to crystallizing that and moving forward with it.

What are your practice interests?
The candidate has no goals related to clinical practice.

Issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
The Search Committee identified 3 areas needing clarification.  (1) The limited publication record was explained above in terms of the diligence with data before it is reported and the increasing publication standards of relevant journals.  (2)  Her somewhat “erratic” presentation history was explained by a confluence of a series of events (e.g., one mentor leaving the area, another mentor dying, and data being “fried” all of which led to having to get new mentors and craft new projects) and the birth of her first child.  She did note that her most recent presentations have been at competitive, top-notch national conferences, and she fully expects to continue such presentations.  (3)  Her career goals were clearly articulated above.</Comment>

<Comment>Recommend we move forward with references checks on this candidate.
Eleanor Stevenson describes herself as hard-working and goal directed. She describes her strengths as being “open to new ideas, constructive criticism and areas which will help her improve her role as a junior nurse faculty member”. 
Mrs. Stevenson will be completing her PhD education in April of this year, her defense is scheduled April 5th, 2011. This comes after 9 years of balancing school and a number of personal challenges which deterred her from her studies. However, she describes her “passion about her specialty” and “focus on her goals” as the reasons why she has been able to complete this goal. “My retrospective view of this period reflects my accomplishments”.
She is currently serving in the role of clinical nurse educator in the ABSN maternity, foundations and synthesis courses. In her role at Duke she has expanded her role from CI working with students in several clinical agencies, to teaching assistant in the maternity course. In this course she participates in lectures, quiz and objective development and student remediation. This role continues to evolve as her collaboration with the lead course instructor to meet the needs of the course increases. She has been involved in teaching at Duke for the past 2 years.
She states she “enjoys the caliber of students and finds them a pleasure to work with”. She sees Duke as a place “where education is evolving and her development as a faculty member will be fostered”.
She believes she is a clinical expert in the field of maternity and is viewed and respected by students as such.
Her practice interest is Labor and Delivery. This is the passion behind her research which focuses on the stress in women who conceive through in vitro fertilization.  Her research career is in the “beginning stages”, however she has received some grant funding for a secondary analysis of her data.  
She believes her weaknesses are around the fact that “I am very young in my career” and “my educational and research expertise are entry level”.  However she has developed several relationships here at Duke that serve to mentor her and support her desire to continue to develop her expertise in scholarship, teaching and research.</Comment>

<Comment>In a phone call with Dr. Field today, I relayed the assessment of his CV made by Dr. Champagne about what rank would potentially have should he be hired at Duke.  The pupose of the call was to make it clear before he came so that he did not waste a visit if he was not satisfied with the APT Chair&apos;s preliminary assessment of rank.  I told him if he was offered a position, it would be as an assistant professor on the tenure track or associate professor on the clinical track (per Dr. Champagne&apos;s assessment as the APT chair).  He did not reject the idea immediately.  He was disappointed that he would not at least be able to come as an associate professor on the tenure track.  I offered to talk with him further or arrange a call with Mary Champagne if he had questions he thought we could answer.</Comment>

<Comment>I see this candidate as lackluster with a CV with some red flags.  The primary red flag is the 10 years of PhD studies without any research publications and yet to complete the dissertation.  Two other red flags are the absence of any published abstracts for scholarly presentations and no grants--not even small internal grants.  I suggest we proceed with caution.</Comment>

Candidate:      K By                                             			 Position:  Stat II
Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
He has not had research funding which is appropriate as a someone not yet completed the PhD (expected July 2011)  He has 4 manuscripts in review and one in preparation.  I would expect one or more publications prior to graduation so this seems like low productivity.   He has developed software for a mixed-models application for SAS (not sure what that means). 

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
His area is statistical models for correlated data.  Does not describe future research objectives.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Teaching experience is limited.  He taught two lower division math courses and was a grader for a graduate courses.  He wrote manuals for statistical software and had to explain statistics to technical writers.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
Limited--Reviewed for a journal in 2009.

F.	 Job stability
He has been in school and so data is not available.  However, he did complete his programs of study.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
In his letter he describes having experience consulting on studies using mixed-models analysis and he developed a related software application.  He also describes familiarity with clinical trials analysis.   His CV does shows only limited consulting experience.  
Summary:  This candidate is less experienced than others we have already interviewed and I suggest we hold the application in case we do not fill the position with the current candidates.  I see no compelling reason in his materials to continue active recruiting at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Secondary Reviewer:
Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Significant funding and publications although I am not familiar with the journals or the funding source because the applicant is working in Japan.  Outstanding productivity for career stage.

B.	Focused program of research
Novel application of informatics to dementia prevention.  Really interesting.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
It appears that most of her teaching at the University of Tokyo are courses in her area of cognitive science.  I’m not sure that I can distinguish any standard informatics type courses such as those in our program.  

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
She is an entrepreneur and has started a nonprofit—Fonobono Research Institute (FRI), a multisector organization for collaboration among community, industry, government and academia for action research on prevention of dementia. Fonobono means heartwarming in Japanese.  She has three patents

F.	 Job stability
No issues noted

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I’m not sure I can assess this.  I think she would be a good fit for Duke University—Psychology &amp; Neuroscience, the Med School.  I’m less certain of the fit with the informatics program.  Would need Dr. Johnson to assess.  Also, because this applicant appears to have never worked in the US, a phone screen would be needed to assess English speaking ability.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
She has no first authored publications noted.  She has one poster presentation noted on her CV.  No research funding is noted.  In light of the fact that she has been working as a research interventionist for the past 7 years I would have expected some additional publications, presentations, posters.


B.	Focused program of research
Her research interest appears to be in the area of HIV/STD/ obesity.  I am not fully clear from this CV that this is what she is researching with her PhD program.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
I am not convinced her teaching experience is congruent with the needs of this position.  She has taught public health nurses in what looks like a continuing education format.  It is unclear if this was a part time or full time position.  I am also unclear about the extent of any faculty responsibilities she had with this continuing ed specialist position.  Looks like she has worked as a TA from 1998-2000, then as adjunct faculty from 2002-2006 teaching women’s health NPs.


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She does appear to have some experience as a NP in OB/GYN between 1996-2001.  No other or more recent clinical experience noted.


E.	Service to the profession
No professional memberships or leadership positions noted on the CV


F.	 Job stability
I am unclear about the positions she has held.  Not sure which are part time or full time and what % effort.  I don’t see any big red flags though for job stability.


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Unsure if she is a match for the FNP program.</Comment>

I think her publication and presentation productivity is very good.  Her research funding is just OK.


B.	Focused program of research
She does not have a deep program of research.  She has done some work in the area of diabetes.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Yes - It appears that she has been teaching primarily in the advanced practice programs.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She has held a variety of clinical practice positions as an advanced practice nurse

E.	Service to the profession
Extensive service to the profession

Yes – her clinical experience as an advanced practice nurse is certainly relevant and congruent with the ACNP position.

E.	Service to the profession
She appears to be an active member of the emergency nurses association and has been recognized for her leadership.

F.	 Job stability
Not a concern

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She does meet the minimum requirements of the ACNP position but we have already made recommendations to the Dean.  I believe we should hold on her application at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Expects to complete PhD by July 2011.  Though young in career, he has no funding and only 1 publication.  # other manuscripts have been submitted and 1 is in preparation.  No strength here.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Describes his expertise as “statistical methods for correlated data” and has developed linear and generalized linear mixed methods.  His particular focused program of research is not clear.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Worked as a “TA/Grader” in Biostats Department at UNC for 4 years in doctoral level class on Generalized Linear Models and several maser’s level classes.  Scope of responsibilities and duties as a TA not made clear.  Also worked as Graduate teaching associate in Department of Math at Cal Poly where he taught 2 lower division math classes each quarter.  Some experience here, but limited.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Is a member of 2 relevant professional organizations, but documents no involvement.  Also has refereed an article for the Journal of Statistics and Computing which is nice.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Has not ever had a “real” job.  Was a substitute teacher for 2 years, then has worked as a TA, a GA, and a statistical consultant/writer.  As a result, all “jobs” are short term.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
None evident.  Is not the strongest candidate in Stats.  Do not recommend further pursuit.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Has held DSN since 1993, subsequent to which she completed a PMC for GNP and one for FNP, as well as a post-doc at UNC.  In light of this, her funding and publications seem to be weak.  She is/was the PI on 3 funded projects, 2 of which were the same study with funding from 2 different sources; no funding is above $40K.  Also involved in 3 other small funded projects, 2 clinical and 1 education in focus.  Has been PD on 3 training grants.  Record of presentations at conferences (including good national ones) is consistent and strong.  Publication record is weak for someone at this career stage – 1 in 2006, 1 in 2007, 0 in 2008, 2 in 2009 (both of which were conference proceedings), and 3 in 2010 (+ one accepted).

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Scholarly activities documented in CV did not give a clear picture of a focused research agenda – diabetes self-management, older adults, medication adherence, urinary symptoms, heart failure patients, m-learning (whatever that is), Telehealth.  Her letter, however, expresses a desire to continue to develop as a nurse researcher to “further advance nursing knowledge as it relates to prevention and management of chronic illness using various Telehealth modalities.”

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Would be most interested to know why she resigned from Yale after only 1 year as a Lecturer and 1 as an Associate Professor (most recent position prior to her current work in CA as senior director of clinical practice [whatever that is] for a tech company).  Taught 3 years and coordinated FNP program at U Alabama Birmingham (from which she earned all 3 of her degrees).  Taught 4 years at UVA and 7 at Auburn (where she coordinated an accelerated program).  Seems to have good teaching experiences and has received a teaching excellence award.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Certified as FNP but not as GNP.  Good clinical practice experience as FNP up to 2006, but no experience since then.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Very active professional, providing much service.  In fact, much of what she lists under “awards” and “consultation” seems like service to me.  Active and involved.  This is strength.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Her teaching “stints” seem to be short-lived, and she seems to move around a lot (AL to VA to AL to NC to CT … and now to CA for a non-academic position).  Question the VERY SHORT stay at Yale !!!


AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I suppose her research focus is congruent, and I suppose she could teach in the FNP program.  But I am always concerned when a candidate is not clear about what position she wants – almost as if she’s “fishing” for anything, after resigning from Yale and now working in CA (while she lives in AL) for a tech company.  Candidate does not seem focused, and that worries me.  I suggest we get more information before deciding to pursue vigorously.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Excellent!  Has had PhD since 2003 and has an extensive and consistent record of grant funding, presentations at national conferences, publications (in scholarly journals [at least I would assume they are well-respected journals] and in conference proceedings), and invited talks which, to me, speak to respect for her work and recognition of her expertise.  Also has 3 patents and documents 67 instances of “media coverage” which, to me, indicates an ability to present well and extensive knowledge about her topics.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Clearly focused on cognitive enhancement of older adults, namely, prevention of dementia by supporting and measuring interactive conversations.  She invented a conversation support method (about which I would love to know more, as she talks about its relevance for education as well as clinical care), has many publications using this method, and has done reviews of articles for the Magazine for Nursing Care Professionals about measuring various elements of conversations.  Fascinating!

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has taught at University of Tokyo for 5 years and held joint appointments in several departments during that time.  Documents teaching many different courses, as well as advising theses and serving on doctoral dissertation committees.  Describes current efforts to develop “project-based learning classes” (which would seem to fit with the emphasis on active engagement of learners) and has presented numerous workshops.  Active in university committees and seems to understand the academic environment … in Japan, anyway.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Active, involved professional with an impressive record of service to the government (committee membership, invited speaker, and “chief secretary” (which sounds like a chair role).

JOB STABILITY  …  
Employed at U of Tokyo for 5 years and held position of project assistant professor there for 2 years prior to current appointment.  Worked for 2 years with the Japan Science and Technology Agency and 2 for the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.  Is also the founding director of a multi-sector research institute focused on prevention of dementia, which is aligned with her program of research.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Expresses commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration and has created the Research Institute with that in mind.  Seems to be an experienced teacher, accomplished researcher, active professional, and recognized expert.  Her academic preparation in Mechano-Informatics would seem to fit with our position.  I recommend we continue recruitment of this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Cannot determine from the CV how long the candidate has been in the PhD program.  She has been in the FNP program since 2005.  She expects completion by Summer 2011 for both degree/certificate.  She has 3 publications but I cannot determine if these related to her research area, which she did not describe in her letter or CV.  She appears to do work in women and children’s health.  No grants listed

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
Cannot determine.  

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Lists several areas of teaching expertise, mainly in women and children’s’ health but does not list any courses taught.  May have little classroom, curriculum based teaching experience.  She has extensive CE teaching experience.  

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Women’s health NP prior experience but I do not see recent practice on the CV.

E.	Service to the profession
None noted in the CV.   

F.	 Job stability

Candidate:      Warshawsky                                             			 Position:  Implementation Science
Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Candidate appears to have completed the PhD in a timely way (plans to complete August 2011).  She has 1 publication in a top nursing scholarly journal.  I would expect at this point in her education that she would have something else under review or in preparation but —since this is not mentioned in the CV, I can’t determine.  She has an Institutional pre-doc.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
She describes her research interests as work culture/environment and her publication is in this area.  She does not mention any research experience in implementation science but does at least try to llink her work to implementation science in her letter.  

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has been involved in teaching since 2007 as a teaching assistant or in clinical supervision.  She would be able to teach in our MSN program in nursing and health systems management but I do not know if we have a need.  

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
n/a/

E.	Service to the profession
She has had little service to the profession given that she has been a nurse since 1982. She was a School of Nursing Senator, Graduate and Professional School Federation and a Student Member of the School of Nursing Doctoral Executive Committee.

F.	 Job stability
The applicant appears to have been in several jobs for 1-2 years.  But it looks as though she move to new areas of the country for some of those job changes so this needs to be explored with her—for example does she have a spouse/partner in the military.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She does not appear to be a strong match with the implementation science position.  I don’t see a compelling reason to continue recruitment of this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Publication record is strong … well-respected journals, research-based, consistent record (2 in 2007, 2 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 2 in 2010, 1 in press, 2 under revision).  Research funding is extensive (i.e., many listed), but none are NIH-type, most are small amounts ($63K seems to be the largest), many are internal (university or SON), 4 of the 10 listed are for the 1 same study, and 3 others of the 10 are for another study).  Candidate is the PI on all grants, giving no indication that she is mentoring others as researchers.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Very clear focus on health needs of Malawi women.  This is her country of birth, and her research addresses violence against female domestic workers, women’s responses to sexual assault, and HIV-infected women.  Her letter notes her “developing research portfolio” focused on East African women living with HIV and the intersection of HIV and gender-based violence in women’s lives.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
3 years teaching at U Wisconsin Madison (though rank not specified, and role described sounds more like a TA) and 5 years (current) at U Wisconsin Milwaukee as an Assistant Prof.  Has taught foundations of clinical practice, basic research, and vulnerable populations.  Also taught health assessment as a TA at Syracuse U and supervised study abroad programs for students at Milwaukee.  She is applying for a Researcher position, so the teaching “match” is not as relevant, it would seem

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Staff nurse 1999-2001 and 2005-2006 in rehab/long term care.  Clinical practice limited, not related to her current area of research, and not recent.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Manuscript reviewer for 3 journals, 2 of which are research oriented.  Other “service” listed is for the university, not the profession overall; however, 1 university contribution was on the Overseas Programs and Partnerships Committee, which would be relevant to DUSON work.  Lists membership (but no committee or officer role) in MNRS, Wisconsin NA, and STTI.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No concerns here

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Global work is interesting and would support OGACHI; however, I think this is what Bei Wu was hired to do.  Do we need another person to do this ???  She could teach in the ABSN program, but not in a clinical course; additionally, this is not what she is interested in.  A most interesting candidate, with an interesting program of research, though definitely not a senior, well-funded researcher.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
MSN since 2005; defending PhD in August 2011.  One publication (in Nursing Research) and 3 poster presentations with her mentor (Donna Havens); 1 paper presentation at NCNA annual meeting; received T-32; no grant applications indicated; no manuscripts under review.  Although she is early in her research career, she has held leadership positions for more than 20 years, and I would have expected more scholarly contributions over the years.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Research focuses on health systems and “how the nurse manager creates a work culture that supports the achievement of superior patient outcomes.”  Difficult to see any of her own trajectory, since her publication and poster presentations are with her mentor and it’s is not clear whether this was her work or her mentor’s (though she is first author on all).

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has been a CI for 6 years (including 4 at DUSON), a TA for 1 year, and a Teaching Fellow for 4 years (while in PhD program, I assume).  Her letter and CV indicate she has been a “co-faculty” in several courses, but it looks like her responsibility in them has been a few class sessions and an online module.  She does not seem to have had responsibility for organizing or delivering a course on her own.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
In clinical practice arena 1982-2005, in staff and coordinator/manager positions.  Most recent positions have been as nurse manager.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Lists membership in AONE, but no committee or leadership roles.  Also lists limited service on UNCSON committees, but no other service to the profession or community.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Many short-term jobs, with 1 lasting 5 years, 3 lasting 4 years (including her CI role at DUSON and her Teaching Fellow role at UNC), and all others lasting only 1 or 2 years.  Seems to have moved quite a bit (PA, DC, VA, SC, NC, HI, and back to NC), reason for which is not explained.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I see nothing in her CV or letter that speaks to EBP or implementation science, and I certainly would not see her as a leader in these areas.  I do not think she is qualified for this position and recommend no further recruitment.</Comment>

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has been teaching at the Univ. of Wisconsin since 2006.  Our position description simply states that teaching contributions are expected.  She has experience teaching a vulnerable populations course as well as the clinical practice foundations course.  She has also organized study abroad experiences for students.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She has less than 3 years of clinical experience practicing as a nurse in two nursing homes.

E.	Service to the profession
She notes some professional affiliations in her CV but no notes on leadership positions within these groups.  She does serve as a manuscript reviewer for 3 journals.

F.	 Job stability
Yes – she has been teaching at U of Wisconsin for 5 years.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I am unsure that she is a match for the researcher position.  She may be a match for an ABSN tenure track position.</Comment>

<Comment>Notes from screening interview between TV, MZ and Dr Otaki

On April 13, 2010 Terry Valiga and I had a 45 minute Skype meeting with Dr. M. Otake.  She is a pleasant woman to speak with.  At times I had a hard time following her responses, found her rambling a little at times, and didn’t directly answer some questions posed of her.  Although English is not her primary language, she spoke English well.  Although she has been in several different departments at the University of Tokyo and had some “variety” there, she is interested in leaving her current position and exploring new opportunities and new cultures.  She is currently faculty at the University of Tokyo; this is where she has obtained all of her graduate and undergraduate education.  The essence of her answer of why she is interested in Duke is the usual answer that there are many resources and opportunities here.  I don’t think I was able to get a clear answer on her interest in the tenure vs. non-tenure track.  When asked what she could teach she noted: health informatics research; basics of informatics; or artificial intelligence research course. She described her general approach in the classroom as somewhat of a problem based learning approach.  She is interested in continuing forward with her program of research in conversation support for cognitive enhancement.  She stated that she currently has funding that could continue with her if she was to leave Univ. of Tokyo.  
She did acknowledge that she would need to “get connected” with the community of HEALTH informatics, as that is not a group with which she has interacted much to this point.  She expressed an interest in blending human science, social science and technological science, though she did not clearly explain what that meant or how it might “play out” in her teaching or ongoing research.  
The recommendation Terry and I would like to put forth to the committee is for Constance and/or Jane Peace to speak with her specific to the area of informatics.  I think we are both “on the fence” about this candidate.  It would be useful to have additional input about her ability to meet the needs of the informatics program.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Recent DNP graduate … Manuscript of capstone project has been accepted for publication in a journal that is aligned with her practice expertise, &amp; she has a few other publications in 2006 &amp; 2007.  Her CV lists presenting on a research project at the AACN NTI in 1999 (1 year post-MSN), but there is no other information about that research project.  Her letter states that she is in the process of applying for an STTI grant.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
None, though her clinical practice, capstone project, publications (few though they are), and professional organization involvement are all in alignment – emergency situations and acute care.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
No academic or staff development experience, but she has taken Education courses during her DNP (I taught several of those courses and will say that Meg was a great student who “got it” and seemed passionate about teaching/learning issues), been a clinical associate at DUSON since 1998 (though I must admit to not being clear on just what that means!), and teaching CE courses.  None of the latter are listed on her CV.  She seems to have a clear career goal related to teaching but most likely would need much mentoring to take on the full scope of a faculty role.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Excellent clinical practice as an ACNP … all focused on ED, trauma, &amp; acute care.  Her letter indicates that the practice for whom she now works is “willing to be flexible” should she be offered a teaching position, which suggests that she plans to continue to practice as an NP.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Excellent involvement in the ENA at the state and national levels.  Also a member of the DUSON Alumni Council.

JOB STABILITY  …  
CV raises no concerns in this area for me.  She’s been in her current job for 3 years, 3 in the one prior to that, 6 before that, and 6 before that.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Expresses serious desire to develop a teaching career and teach ABSN students.  Her clinical experience and expertise, along with her beginning preparation as a teacher, makes her a viable “fit” for the Adult Health ABSN courses, though she probably could also contribute to ACNP courses as well.  I recommend we do a phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
CV documents no research activities &amp; no funding.  She has a decent track record of publications since completing her PhD – 2 in 2008, 2 in 2009, 2 in 2010, &amp; 1 accepted for publication – all of which focus on pain, and all of which are in respected journals.  She also has presented at respected conferences … 3 in 2008, none in 2009, and 3 in 2010.  I would have expected more productivity from someone who’s had a PhD for 4 years.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
It is clear that her work is focused on pain, but her CV documents no research, nor does her letter outline any future plans for how she would contribute to nursing science.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
I must admit to being confused about her teaching.  She was an Assistant Clinical Specialist at Northeastern for a total (though not consecutive) 8 years, but I have no clue what that position means … did she teach, was she on staff at MGH serving as their liaison to the school, etc.?  Then she taught for 1 year at UMass-Amherst, and then 1 year at U New Hampshire.  It looks like the latter position was in 2007, and there is no indication of what kind of position she has held since then.  Her letter talks about her interest in mentoring and guiding students, but nowhere does it indicate what she has taught or what she might teach here.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
She has been in administrative/supervisory positions from 1984-2007 … again, nothing since 2007.  This work has kept her connected to staff development education, oncology, and telemetry.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
She has been on two committees at UNH and indicates service on a subcommittee of the American Society of Pain Management, but there are no dates for the latter.  While she holds membership in several other organizations, she lists no active involvement or leadership in them.

JOB STABILITY  …  
As noted, her current position is a mystery to me, and several of her positions have been short-term.  She did work as a CNS in one institution for 10 years (1986-1996) and then was in another position in that same institution for 4 additional years (1996-2000), but since then, the jobs have all been relatively short in length. All have been in New England (ME, NH, MA).

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I must admit to not seeing any real “fit” with DUSON.  She apparently is quite expert in the area of pain management and her brief letter notes that “issues identified in her clinical work inspired a program of research studying the implementation and translation of pain management evidence in the acute care setting,” there is no evidence of her having any expertise in the area of the position for which she is applying – EBP and implementation science.  I recommend we NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

The teaching areas are not very clear in the cover letter or CV but it appears that she teaches adult health nursing and/or oncology nursing.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
Little service for her career stage

F.	 Job stability
It is difficult to assess this because she lists herself as being employed at a university in Thailand.  However, she also mentions in her cover letter that she is currently living in the US.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I don’t see any areas in which this candidate would contribute to our current research or teaching needs.  Her research productivity is not strong enough for us to consider her for a researcher position.  I recommend that we do not engage in further recruitment.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:      Sanner                                             			 Position:  Researcher
Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
     Her dissertation title is Platelet Serotonin and Depression in the Coronary Artery Disease Population.  She worked with a senior professor—it appears to do a secondary analysis of data but I’m inferring this from the CV where she lists an RO1 as the parent study.  She was funded by Sigma Theta Tau for this research.  The way this is reported on the CV is very messy.  The PI is not mentioned and grant number listed is incorrect.  I found the actual grant by looking up the co-author on the publications.  The grant belongs to Frazier. 
     She has four articles published or in press and three under review.  This is impressive publication productivity for her doctoral work.  She anticipates a May 2011 PhD graduation.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
  All of her publications in a focused area.  However, it should be clarified with her how her research will evolve independently from her mentor’s.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
  She indicates that she has taught women’s health and community health care

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
Does not mention service

F.	 Job stability
No problem noted.  She has been a senior research nurse for 10 years at UT-Houston

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I can’t speak to the teaching needs but she does seem to have potential in research.</Comment>

RECOMMENDATION: Do not recommend moving forward; send a regret letter.
Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.

CV does not demonstrate research or funding. Candidate demonstrates scholarship in publications and presentations which is appropriate for her career stage.

B.	Focused program of research

Candidate does not demonstrate a program of research. Her are of interest is pain management, it evident that she has done some implementation and translation of evidence in the area of pain management. 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.

Candidate currently holds a position as an assistant professor (since 2007). However, her experience with teaching is not provided (what courses, what specialty). Appears she worked with universities in the role of clinical liaison but did not serve as teaching faculty.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

From what I can figure out her practice specialty is nursing leadership/administrations. Served as a in roles of nursing supervisor and educator. I am assuming her expertise in pain management is related to her role as ONC medical director.

E.	Service to the profession
She is a member of professional organizations; however she did not hold service roles in any of them. She did hold service roles in service organizations that appear to be related to her role in hospital administration.

F.	 Job stability
 This does not seem to be a concern. She has held most positions a minimum of 3 years and the last position she has held for 4. 

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Her qualifications are a good fit for the needs of DUSON.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Several small grants (STTI Chapter, Arkansas Nurses Foundation), UNC ECHO program grant ($9K), BAGNC program grant ($84K), &amp; Claire Fagin Fellow ($120K) to support her research.  With PhD completed only in 2009, this is a notable start.  Only 1 presentation at a national meeting and 1 at a regional meeting.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
To be honest, when I started reading her publications and manuscripts in review and presentations, I did not see a clear focus emerge – caregiving responsibilities, nursing student diversity, use of standardized patients to teach breast exam, self-management activities, obesity, new graduate orientation/mentoring, etc.  However, as I read further (including her letter), her program of research is now quite clear – the impact of caregiving on self-management activities &amp; diabetic health of African American grandmothers.  This seems to have good potential for funding, extended work, and interprofessional collaboration.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
She taught only 1 year as an adjunct at UNC Pembroke and 2 years as an Assistant Professor at Winston-Salem.  This is quite limited.  Additionally, it’s not clear what her teaching expertise is since the “courses taught” listed range from adult acute care, graduate health assessment, research methods, community/ public health, foundations, and gerontology.  She has taught in online and on-campus environments.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Several clinical positions over a 10-year period (geropsych, cardiology, bariatric surgery, student/employee health).  Since many were short-term, I question a focused area of specialty development which would be of concern if she were applying for a teaching position in the ABSN program; it is not a concern for a researcher position applicant.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Holds membership in several associations and served as chair of an STTI chapter committee and President of the Little Rock chapter of the NBNA.  Serves as a reviewer for several respected journals and on the Communications Advisory Board of BAGNC.  Served on research &amp; scholarship committees in the schools where she taught.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Most of her clinical positions were for 1-3 year “stints” with 1 position being 4 years.  Her positions since moving out of clinical also have been short.  This raises concern for me about job stability.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Would seem to be a good match with interests that complement current work.  I’m not sure what she would teach that is not already “covered,” but I suppose something would be found.  Her own diversity and her scholarly focus on a minority population are aligned with DUSON’s focus.  I recommend a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:           Jennifer E. Sanner                                        			 Position:  


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
She notes her current position as “senior researcher” and has been in that position for 10 years.  I do not think her funding and publication productivity match this position.  She only has one 1st authored pub (2007) in print, 1 third author (2008), and 2 in 2011 that were accepted for print but not yet printed.  Her research funding is only $2,000.  She also has one podium presentation and 3 poster presentations over this time frame.

B.	Focused program of research
She does not have an established program of research.  She does mention her one grant in the area of Plasma Serotonin and Depression in Acute Coronary Syndrome.  Her publications and presentations appear to be in the area of coronary syndrome and depression.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She appears to have limited teaching experience.  On her CV she lists teaching in May 2010 as an instructor in womens health and nursing skills lab.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Her CV does not fully detail the experiences she has had as a RN.  She lists her clinical experience as a senior research nurse for the past 11 years but she does not detail what this experience involves.  She does not give any specifics about her experiences as a clinical nurse

E.	Service to the profession
She mentions membership in several nursing organizations but she does not give any leadership positions that she has held.

F.	 Job stability
She has been at University of Texas in her senior nurse researcher position for the past 10 years

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Given her minimal scholarly activity and absence of full time faculty experience, I am unsure that she is a fit for a position here at DUSON</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:  Dana Carthron                              			 Position: Researcher II (Onc/ CV/ Gero) 


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
The candidate has had fairly consistent research funding to study diabetic African American grandmothers.  She has one publication since her PhD and faculty position (2009); she has had 3 prior to that.


B.	Focused program of research
Her research appears to be focused on diabetic African American grandmothers.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She does have 2 years of full time faculty experience and one year of adjunct faculty experience teaching a wide variety of courses including health assessment, research, etc.


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She has a wide variety of clinical experience in gerontology, bariatrics, psych, diabetes, cardiology, and community/ family medicine


E.	Service to the profession
She holds membership on several professional organizations.  She is a reviewer for several journals.  She is a member of the communications advisory board for the Building Academic Geriatric Nursing Capacity as well as on the research and scholarship committee for the Winston Salem State University.  She has had some leadership positions in local chapters of professional organizations including the Little Rock Black Nurses Association and the Gama Xi chapter of Sigma Theta Tau.


F.	 Job stability
This is an area of question for me.  I see a very unstable employment history in the candidate.  I see a history of 1-3 year positions.


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

I think she might not be a match with DUSON.  She is applying for the ONC/CV/ NEURO researcher positioner.  Her area of research appears to be aligned with diabetes in African American grandmothers.  Based upon that I do not think she matches with the position to which she is applying.  I would also be very hesitant with her unstable employment history.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone interview
•	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
He states that he would like very much to continue doing the type of statistical consultation role he holds at Wisc-Madison.  He has developed a rich consultation practice with faculty and sees himself as a research career mentor—not just advising on statistics.

•	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
He says he is interested in making a change in part because it is the right timing for his current setting and he and his wife want to move to the east coast.

•	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
He says that he has been impressed by the quality of research in the Duke and UNC systems.  The environment at Duke is the type of setting in which he wants to work and would be most effective.

•	What are your strengths?
He indicated that he is well versed in most methodology and statistical approaches including new methodologies such as hierarchical equation modeling and Bayesian statistics.  He reports a long history of teaching and has taught many different types of statistics.  He says he like seminar teaching best.  
He also indicate that he is strong as a mentor and have been mentoring the junior nursing faculty at Wisc-Madison.  

•	What are your weaknesses?
He feels that he became burned out teaching so much to students that did not really want to learn statistics.  He taught only courses that were “required.” No one took them because they chose to take statistics.  Now he is more concerned about application of the stats than with the mathematics.  

•	What is your most significant accomplishment?
“Production of good researchers and scholars.  He is very proud of his post docs and students he has worked with.  

•	What is your teaching passion?
His teaching passion is in mentoring students and faculty on grant writing and career progression.  He writes stats sections, but is more interested in helping with the big picture how to answer the questions and develop an overall solid grant product.

•	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
He says he has sacrificed his own statistical research interests to assume the consultation role and finds that his most interesting and important contributions come through helping the nurse researchers to their studies.

•	What are your practice interests?
n/a

•	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Given his comments about burnout in teaching stats, I discussed our teaching needs here (or at least what I know of them) in the PhD program.  The small class size was appealing and he approvides of the integrated approaches that we take with combining data analysis and application in each of the stats courses. I will check the references and bring to the committee for decision on whether to move forward.  I do believe that he may have applied to UNC.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
PhD in 2001 and post-doc ending 2003.  Dr. Hamilton has a good history of scholarly productivity.  She has had an R01 and several other smaller grants.  She has 13 publications and 3 papers in review. All of the papers are focused in her research area.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
Her research focus is sociocultural factors and coping strategies that predict health outcomes among older African Americans. The long-term goals of this research will be to inform interventions tailored to older African American cancer patients to assist them to cope more effectively with cancer within their broader social environments.  This research fits well with other research at DUSON.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Dr. Hamilton has taught a research methods course to MSN students.  She states that she is particularly interested in courses that educate nursing students about social and cultural factors that affect the health care of minority persons so they are able to provide culturally competent care.  She is also interested in contributing to educational efforts that assist students from ethnic minority groups to acquire the skills needed for successful research academic careers.  These are consistent with teaching needs at DUSON.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
n/a/

E.	Service to the profession
Manuscript reviewer and NIH grant reviewer.

F.	 Job stability
She has held the last two academic positions for 4 years each.  That could indicate some issues in stability.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She appears to be an interesting candidate for the researcher positioner.  I suggest a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Screening Phone Interview:

•	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Both short and long term goals are to continue to develop research.  Short terms she wants to conduct more pilot studies to develop directional  hypotheses and adapt measures and published before revising and resubmitting her R01 (goal for resubmission is Spring 2012). In the R01, she would do a longitudinal study of the trajectories of coping and timing of the use of coping strategies (my summary does include all of the variables) for African American cancer survivors.  This descriptive study would answer the how and why questions before developing an intervention for this population (the next step in the research). 

•	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She says that she is not unhappy where she is but that she sees the potential for better collaboration at Duke.  She already has several collaborators here in the Divinity School, Medical School, and is developing new colleagues in sociology and anthropology at Duke.  She is seeking this type of interdisciplinary team for her research.

•	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
See above

•	What are your strengths?
She says that her reviews always comment on how well she knows her research population because of the time she has spent directly with them in recruitment and data collection.  This helps her also generate questions for her research. She described her writing skills as strong and she also balances qualitative and quantitative methods in her work.

•	What are your weaknesses?
She says that her weakness in that she has only taught the MSN research course other than guest lectures on her topic of culturally competent research.  She reports little experience in curriculum and course development.  She has not taught online but has used online discussion groups to enhance the classroom teaching. 

•	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Receiving an R01 and producing papers that were published in strong journals.  She is also proud of the teaching innovations that she introduced into the MSN research methods course.  She did not think that the lecture method (tradition for the course) was working well and began working with the students in smaller groups.  Others in the School are now emulating this approach.  

•	What is your teaching passion?
Cultural aspects of research—what are the assumptions underlying existing theories, measures, etc and to what extent do these fit minority populations.  

•	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Health disparities research with African American cancer survivors.  Focused on gaining a better understanding the coping strategies used among older African American cancer survivors, how those strategies influence health outcomes, and examining ways in which sociocultural factors and preferred coping strategies influence health outcomes.  Her focus on older African Americans is grounded in the knowledge that despite advances in cancer diagnosing and treatments, this population continues to experience the highest mortality rates of any other racial or ethnic group in the U.S.  

•	What are your practice interests?
n/a

•	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Dr. Hamilton’s research would strengthen the DUSON’s research given her focus on health disparities.  She is quite knowledgeable in this area and could help other faculty with this interest.  The only issue with her is that she has a narrow teaching experience.  She expressed a strong desire, however, to learn and expand her teaching expertise.  Based on the discussion in the Search Committee meeting (5/2/2011), I will proceed with the reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Recommend we move forward with references checks on this candidate. 

Lucy Valhmu describes herself as “laid back, high motivate and enthusiastic individual who has always has a desire to go back to her Malawi and deal with the health issues of vulnerable populations.”

Her goal is to “move her research forward with some teaching responsibilities.” “My research and teaching involve community health in Malawi around water safety, HIV and Malaria prevention, this is my passion.” Her research looks at the intersection of HIV &amp; violence in the life of women in Malawi.  She intends to submit a R01 in November of 2011 in response to a call for research in her area of expertise.

She is currently serving in a faculty role at the University of WI. She teaches a vulnerable populations course she developed in the classroom and in a hybrid form as well. She also teaches the seminar portion of a clinical course for undergraduates focusing on disparities and what practices are best for vulnerable populations in the community.  She has taken 3 global trips where she facilitated graduate and undergraduate students in Malawi. 

Her practice interest is community health and she works on the weekend during the summer in a long term care facility. 

She describes her strength as her writing for publication and ability to integrate her research into her teaching. She also believes she is an effective team member when it comes to working with others

She believes her weaknesses are in the classroom environment. She needs work on keeping students engaged and making them feel heard. 

She is interested in Duke because she believes she can continue her interest in global experiences in Malawi and she believes there will be support for continued development of research and her research expertise. 

She also mentioned that her husband recently graduated for UNC and the shifts in the economy in WI are a factor in her job search.

<Comment>Spoke with Dr. Matt Peterson on 4/29/2011 regarding the statistician position.  He comes across as a very motivated person.  He is looking for a position that is not funded with &quot;soft money&quot;.  His position now is grant funded.  He knows the Duke system and is well connected within the Duke system.  He clearly states his short comings would include not being a &quot;card carrying&quot; biostatistician.  He does have a good amount of experience providing statistical support and feels he will work well in this role.  He also states that he is also able to expand his own area of independent research.  His other short coming that he addressed is that he has never had a true faculty role.  He has had experience teaching but this is limited to one or two classes.  He does state that his undergrad preparation is in (physical) education so he does have some training in educational theory.  I will move forward with reference checks.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:   Mary Bondmass, PhD             	Position:  evidence-based practice and implementation science


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
In the last 10 years she has secured $36,000 in funding to study critical thinking and NCLEX pass rate, teaching and learning of evidence based practice, as well as widow’s grief.  Her publication productivity is a bit more impressive though.  She has 11 published/ in press manuscripts in the past 10 years, most of which are first authored.  She has several first authored abstracts published as well as conference lectures.

B.	Focused program of research
From her CV, it appears that her area of scholarship is in the area of evidence based practice, grief and heart failure.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Yes – she has taught several courses that are congruent with the position.  These include research methods, nursing theory and the research process, PhD Statistics, Translational evidence for health care systems, and DNP Projects (planning for change).

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Her “other than academic” experience includes an evidence based practice consultant for the University Medical Center, Las Vegas.  This is rather relevant for the position to which she is applying.

E.	Service to the profession
She has demonstrated service through various memberships (ANA, Sigma theta Tau).  She was the director of the Nevada Nurses Association board of directors.

F.	 Job stability
Yes – has been with UNLV from 2001-present

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Although her research/ funding portfolio is a little light, I think she is a potential fit for DUSON in the EBP or stats positions – especially with a little mentoring.  If all are in agreement, I would be OK with moving forward with a telephone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

My short-term goals are to establish myself as a master teacher; I like to mentor others and would want to do that as a faculty member.  Long term, I want to establish myself in the field through my research, while maintaining a teaching role, particularly with MSN and doctoral students.

Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)

I want to expand myself … learn new skills, and learn how to be effective in a new environment.  I also want to become more skilled in integrating technology into my teaching and do not have many resources to do that where I am now.  Also, the supports here at DUSON for developing as a teacher and researcher are wonderful and not available at my current school.

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  

Teaching at Duke has been my dream for a long time.  I see it as the “mecca” of teaching.  The graduates are good and the school prides itself on excellence.  I want to be part of that kind of an environment.

What are your strengths?
 
I establish good “connections” with learners … being able to assess their needs and mentor them.  I strive for excellence.  I am comfortable with the academic environment (e.g., committee work).  And I believe my research is breaking “new ground” and has great potential to make important contributions to our understanding of the needs of grandparents who are providing care.

What are your weaknesses?

I will need support to continue to develop my research skills.

What is your most significant accomplishment?

I am very proud of having received a Hartford pre-doc award and a post-doc award.  I also am very proud of my military experience and how it helped me grow.

What is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online

I would be most excited about teaching community health and nursing research, and I would enjoy mentoring capstone projects.  I taught in the MSN program at Arkansas and would enjoy working with those students.  And I don’t mind teaching online.

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?

I am most interested in the needs of grandmothers who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren, particularly in the African-American population.  I plan to retain this focus and expand it to focus on interventions that meet the needs of this population, hopefully through NIH funding.

What are your practice interests?

I would like to “stay connected” to the care of patients with diabetes.  I am preparing to sit for the acute care NP certification exam.  [No specific plans related to practice were described.]

Issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

The one issue I had raised when reviewing her CV related to what seemed to be some lack of focus in her research … at least initially.  That “concern” was addressed by the time I finished my review of her CV, and the clarity of her research interests were strengthened during this conversation.  I had also raised a question about her apparent lack of “job stability,” but she explained why those “short stints” occurred.

NOTE  …  Dana told me that she recently won the university’s research award  from Winston-Salem State University.  I suggested she update her CV to include that award.</Comment>

<DateOfComment>2011-06-01T00:00:00</DateOfComment>
<Comment>I had a wonderful phone screening interview with Rachel Richesson today.  Below is a summary of our discussion.  In short I would recommend reference checks and, if there are no red flags, further recommend a campus visit.

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Her short term goals are to come to DUSON as a tenure track faculty member.
Long term goals are to expand her area of research working with multidisciplinary teams and to grow as an educator. 

B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She is currently in a research track position which is very independent.  She is ready to more to a position with more teaching and academic focus.  Currently in more of a service driven position without the feel of a larger academic mission.  She would like to have more student involvement in her work.  She would like to have more teaching and academic responsibilities.  There is also no informatics program where she is and would like to be involved with one.

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She is familiar with many scientists here at Duke.  She knows Dr. Constance Johnson and some people at DCRI.  She was on campus a few months ago and has collaborated with people in DCRI.  She was very excited following the visit.  She was most impressed by the work people were doing here as well as with the vibrant academic and scholarly environment.

D.	What are your strengths?
She is very good at working in multidisciplinary teams.  She works as a very good bridge between disciplines and finds linkages.  She referred to herself as somewhat of a ringleader when working in groups to solve problems.  She describes herself as very approachable.  She is able to easily see big picture connections.  She enjoys writing papers to get groups of diverse people (disciplines) together.

E.	What are your weaknesses?
Delegating work is a challenge for her.  She thinks everyone is very busy and should she burden others with work she is capable of doing herself.  She has a hard time giving up work to others but is consciously working on this.

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
She believes the grants she has written in the past, whether funded or not, have been her greatest accomplishments.  She has become “competent” in writing grants through this process.  She feels she has grown in her ability to write grants.

G.	What is your teaching passion?
Although she is not an expert educator, she enjoys teaching.  She has taught a few classes in informatics and has lectured at several conferences.  She feels that she over prepares for classes (she jokingly states that she doesn’t want the students to know that she doesn’t know everything).  She describes her approach in the classroom as starting with the “big picture” and painting a broad picture of the problem.  She feels laying out a solid background is important for the students.  She is good at organizing her classes and picking appropriate readings.  She feels her lectures are very “follow-able” but does state that she has some weakness in engaging students in activities and would like to work on that since she finds the student engagement very important.

H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Research interests are in identifying and evaluating research standards as well as investigating methods and approaches to using research (data) standards and control terminology.  She is interested in applications to real world problems.  She would like to build and evaluate tools for multidisciplinary research.

I.	What are your practice interests?
N/A

J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
She is a new DNP graduate.  She has one paper in press and 2 published.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
None noted in CV.  Her main stated goal is to transition to being a faculty teacher.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has noted not teaching experience on the VC.

Appears to have had significant professional organization service.

F.	 Job stability
No issues noted.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
He became a nurse (RN) and an ANP in 2004 in an msn entry program.  He has two publications and one paper in review.  This is appropriate for career stage.

B.	Focused program of research or scholarly endeavors
No focus is stated in his materials. 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has had two years of teaching experience as a clinical instructor in the Adult NP program at The Ohio State University College of Nursing

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
The applicant is an ANP but is applying for the FNP position.  I don’t see this as a good fit.  He has been working as an NP since 2006 and says he has treated both children, young adult, and adult populations.  However, the only certification he lists is as an ANP.  

E.	Service to the profession
He describes service in the practice setting such as Latino Alliance and board member and NP for a free clinic in Ohio.

F.	 Job stability
He had held his most recent position for 3 years.  All other positions were two years or less back to his first job in 1996.  The reasons for short tenure should be explored.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I don’t see a good fit for this applicant with the FNP position.  Further, there is nothing in this application that says he is an outstanding practitioner, his largest area of experience.  He received a couple of community service awards for work he did prior to becoming a nurse and an NP.  I do not see a compelling reason to pursue this applicant further.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Funding for research is limited, but this may be related to available opportunities to support her focus (i.e., teaching EBP).  She did receive $20K from the NLN, which is the largest grant they award.  Her publication record is fairly good, with most of the more recent ones focusing on EBP and teaching it, but 3 are in Nevada RNFormation, which is not a highly-ranked publication.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
A review of her CV did not reveal a clear focus of research, but her letter clearly indicates that her expertise (and passion) are in the areas of EBP and teaching EBP.  Her publications, presentations, and some grants are aligned with this focus.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has taught at UNLV for 10 years, achieving the rank of Associate Professor with tenure.  Has taught a wide range of courses, including those in ABSN (Health Assessment, Med/Surg), MSN (Educator Practicum, Clinical Leadership &amp; Management … at least I assume these are MSN courses), and DNP (Translational Evidence, Health &amp; Public Policy).  She has served on committees for and chaired DNP capstone projects and PhD dissertations.  She has been nominated for and received awards for excellence in teaching.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
There does not seem to be any recent clinical practice documented in her CV.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Actively involved in Sigma Theta Tau and the NV Nurses Association.  Also has provided leadership within SON (e.g., President of the Faculty Organization, Promotion &amp; Tenure Committee, Chair of the Student Affairs Council) and served on a university search committee (EVP &amp; Provost).

JOB STABILITY  …  
No concerns here, though I am curious about her resigning from UNLV.  All of her references are from UNLV, so I assume her resignation is not reflective of some problem/issue, but it does seem odd for a tenured Associate Professor who has been at the SON for 10 years.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Her work related to EBP and how to teach it, her experiences teaching graduate level courses in EBP, and her consultation regarding EBP to the University Medical Center (Las Vegas) – along with her teaching experience, awards as an excellent teacher, and professional involvement – would seem to suggest she would be a “match” for our EBP position.  A phone interview would seem to be in order.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
This candidate has had her PhD since December 2007.  Since then, she has had a publication in 2008. 2009 and 2010, all in reputable journals (Heart &amp; Lung, Western Journal of Nursing Research, &amp; Annals of Behavioral Medicine).  She has 1 manuscript under review with WJNR.  All publications are focused on cardiac health problems … consistent focus.  She also has presented similar topics at professional meetings, some of which appear to be national ones.  She has received several small grants for her cardiac research, but no major ones.  A $1M proposal to NIH was not funded.  I would have expected a bit more significant funding in light of her research preparation (from U of Iowa) and her topic.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Clearly focused on heart failure and other cardiac events.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Assistant Professor at U Colorado-Colorado Springs/Beth-El College of Nursing for 3 years.  Was a PT instructor (at 2 different universities) for 4 years in Korea.  Taught Adult Health &amp; Assessment in Korea, but all teaching in Colorado has focused on Health Promotion &amp; Nursing Research, with 1 semester of Fundamentals.  Received excellence in teaching award in Korea.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
I see no clinical practice documented in her CV, other than 1.5 years (1995-1996) as a staff nurse in SICU in Korea.  She is currently licensed as an RN in 3 states and Korea and is in the PMC in ANP at DUSON.  Is this primary care or acute care???

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Serves as faculty counselor for Sigma chapter, and is a member of other organizations, including 2 that are research-focused and 2 that are cardiac-focused.  Has served on university and SON committees, and currently serves on 1 DNP capstone project committee.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No “red flags” raised for me.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Limited clinical practice (and lack of any practice in the US or recently) is a concern for someone who would teach in the ABSN program.  She apparently has theoretical and research expertise related to care of patients with C-V problems, but is that enough?  I’d like for us to talk about this candidate before moving forward.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
For someone applying for a position as a researcher, I was not impressed with her funding; however, she has had her PhD only since 2009, so I may be expecting too much.  She documents only $100K in funding … 4 small grants, none of which are from federal sources.  She is, however, currently serving as a post-doc fellow at NIH and becoming more involved in research, particularly in collaboration with others.  Presentations are not stellar – 1 in 2008, 1 in 2009, and 1 in 2010 … 2 were at national conferences (though I do not know what APHON is).  Her publications are in respected journals, but they, too, are not stellar – 0 in 2006, 1 in 2007, 2 in 2008, 0 in 2009, and 1 in 2010.  Again, for someone applying for a researcher position, I would expect more.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Her program of research clearly is focused on children with cancer, focusing specifically on bone marrow transplant patients.  She has advanced training in grantsmanship and research and has received awards for her research

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
She has been a clinical instructor in the Baylor College of Medicine for 11 years, but she does not document anything she might have taught.  On page 8 of her CV in a section called “Didactic Course Work,” she lists 3 topics that she taught in the U Texas SON.  I’m not sure what this category heading means, but I read these as 3 guest lectures.  It does not seem that she has any teaching experience in terms of course development or management.  That is a real concern to me since she will have teaching responsibilities, even if appointed to a researcher position.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
On page 8, she indicates she has “primary responsibility as a PNP on the bone marrow transplant service at Texas Children’s’,” but it is not clear if this is current practice or just what the scope of her responsibilities are.  Her letter indicates “over 20 years of clinical experience,” but that is not clear in her CV.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
She is actively involved as a manuscript reviewer for 4 journals, serves on review panels, and has served as a director-at-large for the National Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology Nurses.  She also serves on several committees in the “department” at TCCC (page 9), though it’s not clear what TCCC is or what her position there is.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Clinical instructor at Baylor College of Medicine for 11 years.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
To be honest, I was not particularly impressed with this candidate, particularly for a researcher position.  I would think her area of research has potential for extensive funding and perhaps that will come during or after her NIH post-doc (which is most impressive!!!).  She says she plans to submit a K99/R00 to NIH in February 2012, but outlines no other plans for seeking funding.  I suppose a phone screen would not hurt, but I’m not inclined to say, “Wow!  We need to capture this person.”  </Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
CV documents no research activities and no funding for community projects or other initiatives.  His DNP is brand new (2011), but he has had an MPH since 2001 and an MSN since 2004.  He has one article in 2006 in the Journal of the American Academy of NPs and has one other submitted for publication in April 2011 (his DNP project, I would assume), though his CV does not say which journal it was submitted to.  In addition, he has 1 poster presentation at the 2004 APHA meeting which (it seems) was published in Behavior Modification (if I read his CV correctly).

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
There is no program of research … no clear focus to his scholarly work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
He taught for 2 years as a CI in the ANP program at Ohio State.  The CV does indicate he “served as course head for the core curriculum in primary care for at least one 7-credit class/academic year,” but I’m not sure what that means.  Also, his letter says his “background is rich with teaching experiences at the master’s level,” but I would not call these 2 years as a CI as “rich” teaching experience.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
He documents 8 years of practice as an NP, primarily with adults, and he is certified through the AANP.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
The CV documents consistent and extensive volunteer work through free clinics, and he has received awards for his community service, which is admirable.  He documents no membership or involvement in professional organizations, and no leadership initiatives  in his NP positions.  Service to the profession seems rather weak.

JOB STABILITY  …  
He is in his current position for 3 years.  All prior positions were only 1 or 2 years in length, which raises “red flags” for me and would need exploration, should we decide to pursue this candidate.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I am concerned that his practice is with adults (is that what he is certified in?), yet he is interested in the FNP position.  I do not see that fit.  I also do not see strength in teaching, professional involvement, or scholarly work.  I recommend we do NOT pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>PHONE SCREEN  …  June 16, 2011

What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
My short-term goal is to become a professor of nursing and to be a good teacher with updated clinical skills.  Long-term, my goal is to be a FAAN and be recognized as a good teacher and good researcher.

Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
I am doing well where I am.  I’m on the tenure track and carry a workload of 40% teaching (which equates to 15 credits between the fall and spring semesters), 40% research, and 20% service.  There is limited exposure (for me and for my students) to major medical centers where I am now, and I would like to be in a place like that.

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
As a PMC student at Duke, I’ve been amazed by the quality of nursing education there and believe it’s one of the best schools in the world.  I also see the potential for connections throughout DUHS for my research, as well as for good learning experiences and potential employment for my students.

What are your strengths?
I am a good teacher who cares about my students.  Students say I am inspirational.  I set high standards for students and believe in them to reach those standards.  I am a good listener, conscientious, and an effective team member.  I also seek advice from my chair and senior faculty, and I respond well to feedback.  I also am able to remain calm in the face of problems [and described a situation that happened in a classroom recently].  Also, having been born and grown up in South Korea, I bring a bi-cultural perspective to my students and colleagues.

What are your weaknesses?
Because English is not my native language and I want to be correct in speaking, I sometimes speak a bit slowly, and the students sometimes complain about this … but I’m getting better.  Sometimes the acculturation challenges make it hard for me to understand student behavior, student/teacher relationships and other things in the US … but that’s when I seek advice and guidance.

What is your most significant accomplishment?
I am pleased that I completed a PhD in my 2nd language … and that I was able to balance raising a family at the same time.

What is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online
All of my teaching to date has been with undergraduate students – traditional BSN, accelerated BSN, and RN-to-BSN – and I enjoy that … though I expect I would enjoy teaching graduate students, too.  My research courses have enrolled 40-60 students, I taught a health promotion course online, and I taught 1 clinical group in a Fundamentals course (but no other clinical teaching).

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
My dissertation focused on gender differences in MI patients, but I have since shifted my focus to the use of technology to help older adults manage their heart failure or other C-V problems.  I want to continue to work with heart failure patients and helping them self-monitor – possibly using iPhones, iPads and the like – to manage their health problems.  I also am interested in prevention measures related to C-V status for college-age students.

What are your practice interests?
I am in the primary care ANP program at DUSON and hope to work with adults who are post-MI, have HTN, or have other C-V problems to prevent future problems and manage current ones.

Issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
If I were to be appointed to this position and the course focused largely on acute care issues, I would need to engage in some acute care practice before teaching the course in order to update myself.  I would be comfortable teaching Pharm, Patho and similar foundational concepts (particularly since I’m studying those areas in my PMC program).  I taught acute care Adult Health in Korea for 4 years and was most comfortable with that, and the residency I completed in Iowa in 2006 (which occurred after receiving my RN license in the US) gave me good experiences in caring for patients with C-V problems.

Comments from the Interviewer
Ju Young was wonderful at remembering the questions I had asked and cycling back to them after the conversation may have drifted in a slightly different direction.  I did not have to work hard to keep her focused.

She also asked if there would be a conflict with being appointed if she were still a student in the PMC program.  She does not plan to finish that program until May 2012.  I told her I did not know and that would be a question we would have to discuss with the committee and the dean.

She does speak a bit slowly, but her English is very good.

I recommend we contact references or – if that is no longer part of our process at this point – bring her in for an interview.  Although her acute care experience is a bit limited, she is more than dedicated to doing what she needs to do to get back “up to speed,” and I got the impression that this is a woman who does whatever she sets her mind to do.

By the way … Although she sounded a bit disappointed, she did say that she was still interested in the position, even though it&apos;s on the Practice Track.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Wang has done work with National Agencies on funded projects for disease control and prevention in China. He states these projects were funded and developed his expertise with statistics in the public health sector. 
If hired at Duke this would be Dr. Wang’s first formal role as a statistician. However, he has previous experiences as a research assistant and work in the area of biostatistics which matches our needs.This includes preparing a grant for his work in China, working on several projects to determine sampling methods and doing power analysis. Participated in a longitudinal study, survival analysis of heart failure clients. He had to take his time to respond to questions but I was able to get a sense of his experiences and knowledge of statistics during our conversation. I would like to see him respond to more specific questions about his own work and his ability to meet the needs of the faculty. I recommend that we move forward with a campus visit.



What are your goals for a faculty position? Goal is to use academic training to be an effective teacher and facilitate the application of research to public health issues.

Why duke??I believe my skills and previous experiences match the needs of Duke. I am comfortable with statistics and interested in the collaboration with nursing faculty and interdisciplinary teams.

What are your strengths? My strength is my understanding of public and functional biostatistics from and interdisciplinary approach.

What are you weaknesses? I am still working on being a more effective presenter and increasing my interaction with students? I have taking some workshop offerings that will help me improve communication with students and decrease barriers of language in my communication.

What is your most significant accomplishment? The work I completed in China with the CDC. The projects focused on HIV/Aids, asthma and allergic disease in children. I am proud of what we accomplished to improve health in the community.

What is your teaching passion? I have been a TA and taught several courses to 30-40 students.  I have taught both undergraduates and graduates students. I present lecture in the classroom setting. I like to capture the interest of the students. I try to set clear expectations keep the channels of communication open and incorporate a variety of learning styles. I try to present so the students can visualize the concepts by using things like schematics.

What are your practice interests? I am interested in cancer, immunology and public health issues like STD’s.

Future research- I would like to continue to focus on public health. I am interested in continuing longitudinal studies of children. I am also interested in data mining and nursing informatics.

What contributions would you make to DUSON? I think I can contribute to data analysis of nursing science and assist the school of nursing make full use of data collected to impact changes in health.
Dr. Wang who successfully completed his PhD in May was very pleasant to speak with.  
Dr. Wang presents as being very interested in teaching and sharing his knowledge of statistics with students in the classroom, making the concepts plausible and manageable based on the level of the learner. He sounds comfortable talking about statistical processes. His conversation indicated that he was vested in the professional development he needs to increase his strength in the barriers his dialect and presentation style caused.</Comment>

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No publications listed on CV.  Mentions that she will be published in “Melnyk &amp; Fineout-Overholt&apos;s newest publication on nursing and evidence-based practice” but does not say whether this is a book chapter or journal.  Also mentions plans to publish her DNP project.

B.	Focused program of research
None

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Five years of teaching experience in a diploma program and or community college program.  Her teaching experience includes content in medical-surgical and psychiatric concentrations. Topics for lectures have included diabetes, obstructive pulmonary diseases, anemia, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.  She has also been a clinical instructor

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She has had clinical experience in pychiatric mental helath/additive units and in a nursing home.  She has been teaching since 2006 before which she had 8 years of clinical experience.

E.	Service to the profession
None mentioned.


F.	 Job stability
No problems noted

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Her MSN was in “contemporary nursing faculty” major which the Drexel website states prepares nurses to assume roles as nursing educators, nursing professors or nursing faculty in the varied types of nursing programs.  Given her strong focus on education and five years of teaching experience in pre-licensure programs, it may be worth following up to see if she matches the current needs in the ABSN.  

Her DNP program prepares student in conducting evidenced-based change projects and thus this emphasis should fit with work at Duke in the DNP program.  She is a brand-new graduate and will need much mentoring in scholarship—appropriate for career stage.</Comment>

<Comment>I met with Dr. Rogers at Duke while she was visiting UNC to conduct the screening interview.  The purpose of her visit to UNC was attendance at an intervention research institute and grant writing workshop.
A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?  Dr. Rogers is looking for faculty position where she can build her program of pediatric research and be mentoring to be an excellent teacher.  
B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Not applicable.  Dr. Rogers will finish her postdoc in June of 2012.
C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Dr. Rogers is currently a postdoc with Dr. Marilyn Hockenberry.  From her discussions with Dr. Hockenberry she has become very familiar with the strengths of the pediatric faculty at Duke as well as the DUSON support for research.  She is looking for a faculty position in a research intensive environment that can support her research interests in symptom management for children with chronic conditions.
D.	What are your strengths?  Dr. Rogers described herself as having expertise in pediatric oncology practice.  She has used her clinical expertise to produce several scholarly publications, primarily book chapters.  She also feels like she has a strong foundation in clinical research.
E.	What are your weaknesses?  Dr. Rogers described her main weakness as having limited teaching experience.  While she has given numerous guest lectures she has not had the opportunity to be in charge of a course.  She had hoped to be able to teach in her postdoc, but the structure of her research postdoc does not permit teaching.  She does however hope to be able to teach a course at one of the local schools of nursing in the spring.  They have asked that she consider teaching a course in pediatrics. 
F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
G.	What is your teaching passion? Dr. Rogers has had limited teaching, but her most meaningful experiences to date have involved one on one experiences with medical and nursing students.  
•	Class size
•	Clinical groups
•	Online
H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?  Dr. Rogers plans on submitting a K99 in October.  If funded this would provide her with significant protected time to develop her clinical interventions for symptom management.
I.	What are your practice interests? Her primary interest is in pediatric oncology, but she is also interested in a variety of pediatric chronic illnesses that are prone to symptom distress.
J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. None</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:    Dr. Ileen Craven                         			 Position:  ABSN Expansion

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Based upon her CV and letter of interest, she has no evidence of publications or funding.

B.	Focused program of research
None noted in her CV or letter of interest

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
I am not clear on this one.  She has taught at a diploma school of nursing for the past 4 years as well as at a community college for one year.  According to our current job posting we are looking for someone with adult health and community health experience.  Her clinical experience has been in home health and psych/ addictions while her teaching experience has been in some adult health areas.  I could say that her teaching experience is congruent with the positions needs however she has never taught in a BSN program.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Her clinical experience has been in home health and psych/ addictions.  This would be relevant to the position posted.

E.	Service to the profession
Although she lists 3 professional affiliations, she does not list any leadership activities within those organizations.

F.	 Job stability
Not a problem.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Simply based upon her CV and letter of interest, I am unsure that she would be a match for the position we are attempting to fill.  Her CV is pretty thin when looking at academic achievements.  She has never taught on the BSN level.  I do not think she is the best fit for this position.  I recommend no further recruitment.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:    Lubna Daraz                         			 Position:  Researcher


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Yes- she is a recent PhD graduate and does have some small dollar funding which appears to have helped fund her doctoral research.

B.	Focused program of research
Yes – she appears to have a focus on knowledge exchange and web based health information

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
I do not think her teaching experience is fully congruent with the position needs.  She has only served as a teaching assistant and guest lecturer.  No experience noted as a course coordinator or as a full time faculty member.  She has assisted with courses in database management, knowledge exchange and transfer as well as contemporary communication technology.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

E.	Service to the profession
Minimal 

F.	 Job stability
Aside from teaching assistant work, I do not see any employment listed on her CV.  I am assuming that she was engaged in education full time from 1999-2011 based upon her CV.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I think she has the potential to fit with DUSON.  She may be able to contribute not only to research as a junior faculty member, with good mentoring, but also contribute possibly to the informatics program here as well.  I recommend a phone interview at this time.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:    Alison Edie                         			 Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
I did not notice any research funding on her CV.  I also do not notice any publications.

B.	Focused program of research
Although she has not been performing as an independent researcher, she has clearly been involved with research teams through her employment as a FNP with the Duke pediatric allergy and immunology division.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Yes – she has taught with the MSN (ANP/FNP) and ABSN programs.  She has taught in the N332, N333, and N334 courses over several years primarily as a clinical instructor and lab instructor.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Her clinical practice is very relevant to the position to which she is applying.  Her experience as a NP has been in a variety of clinical specialty areas including allergy/immunology, family practice, primary care, OB/Gyn, orthopedics, and public health.

E.	Service to the profession
She does not list any leadership positions on her CV.  She does list a few professional memberships.

F.	 Job stability
Yes

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I believe she has the potential to contribute to DUSON.  She has taught here as a part time clinical and lab instructor.  Her wealth of experience would be an asset to the students in the classroom.  I have taught with her a few times  in the lab portion of the physical assessment course and have found her to be very thoughtful, considerate, and generally good at conveying ideas and concepts to students.  My concern is that she has no full time faculty experience and would need some mentoring on the role as all new full time faculty require.  She also has no publication history.  My other concern is that she is 1 year from completing her DNP and I am unsure if she has a defense date set yet.  All that said, my experience working with her in the classroom makes me think she does have potential for a successful academic career with mentoring and she could fit the teaching need we have in the FNP program.  I would recommend that we cautiously move forward with a screening interview.</Comment>

<Comment>What are your goals for a faculty position? 
Nursing is my second career. I love the profession and can’t imagine doing anything else. 

Why duke??
My husband needs to relocate, so I have been researching schools. Duke is innovative, has good outcomes and great academic reputation. I love academia and Duke seems to be making major contributions to academia.

What are your strengths? I embrace change. I am also open to new things

What are you weaknesses? I am always afraid I am not teaching the essentials. It is hard to balance what students need to know without feeling like you are not giving them everything they need.

What is your most significant accomplishment? 
My DNP, I plan to publish my capstone work. Want to expand my project on caring and how students perceive caring based on Watsons theory. My DNP projects demonstrate teaching students to care leads to better outcomes which least to more cost-effective care. I did a pre-post measure of caring. I was pleased with my work and the possibilities

What is your teaching passion? 
I am passionate about disease management, patient education and health promotion. I think it is important to teach communities and individuals that will serve communities (students) about prevention and health promotion models. In the fall semester I will be doing a pilot project in which I will be using a negotiated social model to share teaching with the students. For the first hour of class students will teach each other and I will begin my lecture presentation in the second hour.

What are your practice interests?
Med-surg nursing especially HIV and psych-mental health nursing.

Future research- I want to expand on my project on caring.

What contributions would you make to DUSON?  I love teaching and nursing students. I can support the work of the nursing program.
Mrs. Craven completed her DNP in May 2011. Candidate has served in faculty role where she has had the responsibility of course coordination; advisor, mentor and champion of EBP to ensure quality and safety of care. She has not taught ABSN students but states 60% of the students she currently teaches have professional degrees. Class sizes have been up to 75 students at a time. Candidate taught 3 of 4 semesters 2  med-surg and 1 psych. She is familiar with the concept of team teaching. 
Mrs. Craven was pleasant to talk to. She presented as one who was comfortable with role in facilitating teaching and learning. I was impressed with her application of nursing theory to her teaching. She articulates confidence in med-surg and psychiatric mental health nursing and a passion for nursing.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
This is a new PhD who indicates her master’s was a non-thesis, so one would not expect a strong research track record.  However, for someone pursuing a Researcher position, I would expect more strength.  She is a co-investigator on 1 project, a committee member on another, an RA on another, and the PI on 2 projects, one of which was a dissemination intervention project that resulted in a brochure and the other of which was a lit review that resulted in a quality checklist.  These may be valuable “products,” but they are not what I think of for a “researcher.”  Publications are limited, but professional presentations seem strong.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Her interest in helping patients access and judge information that will improve their health is clearly expressed in her thoughtful letter.  To be honest, I do not see this addressed as a clear program of RESEARCH, but it clearly is a program of INTEREST that I suspect she will pursue.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Teaching experiences limited to being a guest lecturer, TA, and PBL tutor.  All of these were valuable, I would think, but there is no evidence of having responsibility for a course, orchestrating student learning experiences, assessing student learning, etc.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable … This is not a nurse.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
I do not see this in her CV at all.

JOB STABILITY  …  
It’s really hard to tell.  She lists many different “teaching experiences” at U of Western Ontario, McMaster U, U of Toronto, Brock University, and other places.  But I don’t know if any of these were “real jobs.:”

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I do not see this person as a strong candidate for a Researcher position, but given her preparation and background she might be a “fit” for the Informatics position, though I would think she would need extensive mentoring as a teacher.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Accomplished researcher with good funding.  Post-doc at UDUB.  Lists 8 grants, 4 of which are in process, but indicates being PI on only 1 of them.  Lists 15 research projects and notes being PI on 4 of them.  11 of the 15 research projects are in process … How can anyone really do that?    Candidate is highly productive regarding publications in journals that are appropriate to and (I assume) highly respected in her area of expertise.  She also has a strong record of presentations at national/international conferences, again ones that seem most appropriate to her research work.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Very clear about her program of research  …  “conduct cutting edge physiological investigations of clinical phenomena in critically ill children” particularly focusing on “the interplay of the GI immune system, transplantation and nutrition in children.  Has been mentored by Dr. Margaret Heitkemper, which is impressive.  Her cover letter provides extensive information about her research trajectory and suggests great passion for this work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Her CV lists 3 years as a “Clinical Assistant Professor” at UDUB, but it’s not clear what that means.  She does not indicate any courses that she taught, and page 1 of her CV clearly lists Seattle Children’s Hospital as her employer (i.e., she makes no mention there of this teaching position).  Additionally, in her letter, she expresses no interest in teaching, other than a brief mention (in the last paragraph) about “valuing the opportunity to be an active participant in coordinating student projects and providing thesis and dissertation advisement.”  It seems clear to me that she has no interest in taking responsibility for a course or contributing in any significant way to the teaching needs of DUSON.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Certified as ARNP in Peds and currently works as (1) a PNP at children’s Hospital in Seattle and (2) a per deim RN in the PICU at Swedish Medical Center, also in Seattle.  Her research is clinically focused.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
She lists membership in several organizations but indicates no involvement in them.  Under “Professional Membership” she indicate that she is a member of the research team for PIFCon, but this sounds like a national  research coalition, not any kind of professional organization.  I could be wrong, though … I don’t know what PIFCon is.  

JOB STABILITY  …  

I have some questions here.  She lists 2 1-year positions, 1 2-year job, and 3 jobs that she has been doing since 2004 or 2005.  I would assume that none of these are full-time, so I would wonder about her ability to make a commitment to an organization and help it move forward … not just advance her own research, but help the entire organization meet its goals and advance?

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
The DB indicates she is interested in a Researcher position.  If that’s true, then I think she’s a great candidate and would bring a unique perspective to our faculty with her focus on physiological research.  Her letter, however, indicates she is applying for a Tenure Track position.  In this case, I would be concerned about her lack of teaching and lack of professional involvement, as well as wonder about her organizational commitment.  I recommend a phone interview (a) to clarify the position in which she is interested and (b) clarify the questions about teaching and job stability.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
CV lists no research activity or funding, and no grant funding.  For someone who has had her doctorate for 18 years, her scholarship is very limited.  She lists 1 refereed article but indicates it was submitted in August 2010 … was it published???  She lists 5 abstracts, 3 of which are “submitted (2010, 2009, and 2008), and 2 of which were presented … 1 in 2008 and 1 in 2009.  Her journal articles (6 listed) indicate 3 were submitted (all in 2008!), 1 was accepted in 2008 (but was it published???), 1 published in a book in 2008 (a 1-page contribution!), 1 in 2006, and 1 in 2005.  By the way, several of her posters and articles focused on administration issues, and I saw nothing related to community health.  I found all of this to be most confusing, and I read it as her not being concerned enough to make sure her CV was up to date.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
There is no program of research indicate, and no plans to develop and pursue one.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
She apparently is quite skilled in curriculum development, which is a plus, and she does hold an EdD which is in Marriage &amp; Family Counseling; I would assume this included an emphasis on teaching/learning, curriculum, and so on, but it has no focus on nursing.  For the past 6 months she has been an adjunct professor at Duquesne, supervising DNP capstone projects, and chair of the department of nursing education at a small university in VA.  Prior to that she spent 2 years developing the curriculum at the College of Coastal GA, and the 2 years prior to that were spend doing 2 jobs … teaching at LSU and serving as an administrator at a Psychotherapy center.  She spent 3 years as “faculty” at the LSU Law Enforcement CE department.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
As Chief Health Officer and CEO at the Psychotherapy center, she provided direct patient care in a clinic (patient focus seems to be women’s health) in addition to all her administrative responsibilities.  She lists 2 years as “Preceptorship-Women’s Health NP” at Vanderbilt &amp; Women’s Health Center, but it looks like this would have been the time she was an MSN student at Vanderbilt.  I am not clear how she would have been able to “act at a preceptor in the high risk OB clinic performing administrative &amp; management functions when the NP was unavailable.”  I do not see any community health experience, she says she holds APN certification in several states but does not indicate the specialty (though I would assume it’s women’s health), and I see no other clinical practice experience.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
I see no active involvement – or even membership! – in professional organizations.  Am I missing that?  She has had nice state appointments and been active at that level, but nothing in the nursing profession.


JOB STABILITY  …  
I have some concerns here.  Other than a 17-year stint as Executive Director for the National Sexual Trauma Center, I see no positions lasting more than 2 years.  This ED appointment is nice, but I wonder how someone can be the lead on-the-ground person for a national organization and hold  all those other positions at the same time.  

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I have major concerns about this candidate and recommend we not pursue her.  I see no preparation, practice, or expertise in community health (though she has taught this kind of course now and then).  I see no scholarly activity or significant professional involvement, and I think her clinical practice is weak.  I am concerned about job stability.  Although she seems to have expertise in and passion for curriculum work, her teaching experiences are somewhat limited.  And finally, I must admit to being concerned about (a) the confusion and seemingly not-up-to-date nature of her CV, and (b) her seeming lack of focus (she has degrees in guidance/counseling, religious education, theology, nursing, marriage &amp; family counseling … her publications [limited though they are] address women’s health, administration issues, and education).</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
The CV lists no research completed (not even her dissertation!) and no funding or even grant submissions.  She lists 2 submitted and 1 in press articles related to the RO1 grant from which her dissertation evolved (she is 1st author on the “in press” manuscript).  She has a 2010 article (8th author) in Issues in Mental Health Nursing, also related to the RO1 project/dissertation work, and 6 others (refereed and non-refereed, published between 2000 and 2007) that focus on cancer care.  Her poster and podium presentations are largely local or regional, and all but the 1 in 2010 (which, again relates to the RO1/dissertation) focus on cancer care. She notes no podium presentations since 2008, but she probably was in her PhD program during those years.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
For someone who is applying for a Researcher position, I was sorely disappointed that she did not outline ideas related to her program of research.  All she said in her cover letter was “my own program of oncology and end-of-life research.”  I see no thinking related to questions she wants to study, potential sources of funding, interprofessional research teams she might want to create, etc.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
She certainly has done patient and staff teaching as a CNS, but her only “academic” experience was as a TA, and that’s mentioned only in her letter.  It seems she would be starting from “ground zero” in terms of teaching and the faculty role.  Even though she is interested in a Researcher position, all faculty are expected to teach and provide service; she would need extensive mentoring for this part of her responsibilities.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
She has extensive clinical experience related to cancer care … 20 years as a staff nurse or CNS and 2 years as a nursing supervisor.  She documents no clinical work since 2009, but that was when she was in her PhD program.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
The candidate documents active involvement in professional organizations that “match” her clinical practice area.

JOB STABILITY  …  
This is not of concern to me.  Except for the last few years while she was in her PhD program and having “short stint” jobs, she was a staff nurse in one position for 12 years and a CNS in another for 7 years.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I have reservations about this candidate for a Researcher position.  Although her PhD is new, she documents no research activities, no grant writing, etc.  More concerning, however, is that she expresses no specific direction for her own research agenda.  Her dissertation seemed to take her into an area that is not her expertise or passion, and her reasons for doing that make sense.  But I wonder what her research aims are related to her “own program of oncology and end-of-life research.”  As stated above, I see no thinking related to questions she wants to study, potential sources of funding, interprofessional research teams she might want to create, etc., and this concerns me for someone interested in a Researcher position.  I am inclined to say “No” to this candidate, but I would not argue strongly against a phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
•	Does not appear that any work related to her DNP capstone (or other educational grants) has been published and given that it they are in areas of interest to clinicians in pediatric care and educators, that does not indicate a contribution to nursing literature. I&apos;m concerned about her having no signs of contribution to the nursing literature. 
B.	Focused program of research
* Appears to have completed some educational and clinical research but is limited to two apparent areas and to presentations (most local); no pubs noted. No research areas mentioned in cover letter or clear pursuit of ongoing research past DNP in CV. 
C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
•	Community health teaching has been in clinical mentoring only – not in the course coordination or classroom portion which is vital to the position in the ABSN program.
•	Experiences in community health clinical rotations are both in local community and missions abroad which would fit the needs clinically or our ABSN program.
•	Evident experience in teaching cultural competence, which would also be valuable in the ABSN program and DUSON.
D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
•	DNP provides exemplar of clinical terminal degree for students in ABSN program
•	Does not appear that she is currently practicing but is licensed NP.
E.	Service to the profession
•	Appears to be an active Sigma Theta Tau member – counselor and delegate – which would be beneficial if became active in our chapter.
F.	 Job stability
•	Teaching at Jefferson for last 4 years. No stability concerns noted.
G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
•	Global and community health experiences would be highly relevant to ABSN/other DUSON needs.
•	Cultural competence – educational experience could be relevant to ABSN /DUSON needs.

My major concerns are her lack of publications and area of ongoing research (although I realize this is a clinical track position but some scholarly contributions would have been expected from her DNP/other educational small grants?). However, I could be persuaded to procede with phone screen to sort those out further and also, due to urgent community health needs for ABSN and her clinical teaching experience in this area, to figure out whether she has any experience with classroom portion of that course or course coordination to truly be able to determine whether she has potential to meet needs of the ABSN position.</Comment>

Candidate:    Ann “Michelle” Hartman, DNP 			 Position:  ABSN Community Health

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
She has only one publication listed on her CV which is a book chapter.  I believe this is essentially a reflective piece about her experiences as an educator.  She has no evidence of journal publications.  This is rather surprising for a person who has been a faculty member for four years now.  She does have some evidence of small grant funding.

B.	Focused program of research
The small grants she has obtained have helped fund her research in The Impact of Cultural Immersion on Student Nurses&apos; Cultural Competence.  She has presented this work at 3 conferences.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Yes – she has served as a clinical preceptor for community health on several occasions.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Yes – she does have relatively recent clinical experience as an advanced practice nurse between 2001-2007.  She does not list her experience as a registered nurse and in what areas she practiced.

E.	Service to the profession
Yes – she does demonstrate small group leadership for international medical missions as well as service as a chapter delegate for STTI.

F.	 Job stability
Yes – her listed positions have spanned 3-5 years each.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I believe her areas of potential contribution would be directly in line with the position for which she is interested, namely the community health ABSN position.  Based upon her teaching history she could potentially contribute to the ABSN program beyond the community health courses (physical assessment, professional nursing, pathophysiology, etc.).  I think she has potential to contribute to the MSN program as well.  She is an advanced practice nurse with current practice experience.  That said, she has a severe lack of publishing productivity and most of her presentations appear to be local conferences.  Based upon the needs of the ABSN program for classroom faculty, and her potential to contribute to meet that need, I am inclined to support a telephone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>Recommendation: I am inclined to do a phone screen to further explore his match
Candidate:       Jiaping Wang                                            			 Position:  Statistician 

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Scholarship is demonstrated by completion of 4 first authored publications, 3 submissions and 2 manuscripts in process. Candidate has also collaborated on some papers with colleagues.  Does not mention any funding sources for pre/post-doctoral work or any projects he/she may be involved in.
B.	Focused program of research
Candidate states interest in longitudinal data analysis using functional and survival analysis. However, there is no of mention of independent research goals.
C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Candidate’s most recent teaching experience is as a teaching assistant in post-doc program teaching statistical and mathematical methods.  In 2004-2006 the candidate was a doctoral student and teaching assistant in the math department teaching calculus, stats methods and elemental statistics to undergraduates. From 2006-2009 became and independent instructor (I am not sure what that means) with the same teaching responsibilities

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

CV demonstrates most recent work to be in the area of radiology and neuroimaging. Candidate states there has been collaboration with Psychology department.
E.	Service to the profession

Candidate did not list any affiliation with service organizations. However candidate is presenting at an international medical imaging conference this year.
F.	 Job stability

This does not seem to be an issue. The candidate was at SUNY from 2004-2009 and the went to UNC where Post doc work was completed.
G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

His knowledge of statistics and math are a match. However he does not seem as strong as previous candidate I conducted a phone screen with. Additionally I don’t see how radiology-neuro-imaging will match interest of faculty or how candidate’s interest in this area could be met.</Comment>

<Comment>Summary of Telephone Screen.


A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
•	Goals are very focused upon developing her program of research in 2 areas:
o	Emotion Regulation in Preschoolers
o	Maternal mental health impact on young children’s development
•	Short term goals are related to continuing to analyze extensive data collected for dissertation and publishing the results.  She has analyzed the major part of her dissertation data but has another section of data on negative affect that she could analyze and publish from
•	Once she has completed analysis and publication she would take the next step in her program of research and apply for an R03 and R21
•	Teaching at the undergraduate or MSN program level

B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
•	Her ultimate goal has always been to be a researcher within a school of nursing.  She is currently an international student at U of W on a Student F1 VISA (from China). Thus she is not eligible for postdoctoral funding from NIH.  I spoke with her about our postdoctoral program funding that is internal and thus not dependent upon US citizenship.  She was interested in this. 

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
A.	She is looking for a research intensive school.  Also she is looking for a good mentor while a junior faculty member. She identified DHD and myself as possible mentors.  She mentioned our child-health research program funding. 

D.	What are your strengths?
Passion &amp; motivation for research.
Persistence and perseverance.

E.	What are your weaknesses?
She stated that she has a strong background in research and teaching but is weak in the area of clinical practice. While she has a Washington State RN license, she has never practiced in the US.  To make up for this she obtained a child/adolescent mental health clinical specialist certificate.  

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Thus far it is her PhD

G.	What is your teaching passion?
•	Class size
i.	She has worked as a TA in two undergraduate nursing courses  (Human Development; Childbearing and Childrearing) in which she lectured and supervised students in clinical practicum and with clinical reflection. 
Ii.	She thinks that her passions lie in teaching at the MSn level where she could encourage small group discussion. 
Iii.	
•	Clinical groups
•	 	Childbearing and Childrearing.
•	Online
i.	Has used of Blackboard (discussion board ) in her positions. 

H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
See A above. 

I.	What are your practice interests?
She would be interested in working with mental health clinics at Duke to screen for maternal depression etc. 

J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

I had an hour long discussion with this pleasant young women who is currently completing her PhD (defense scheduled in August) at U of W. She has been in the US since 2002 and speaks good English and was able to comprehend the questions I was asking and respond appropriately.  This candidate is clearly interested in a tenure track research position.  

I think that this candidate has a very bright future as a tenure-track faculty researcher.  While a postdoctoral fellowship would allow her to complete her current study analysis and publishing, I think that she would also do well as a junior faculty member with close mentoring.  I recommend a formal interview.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Appears to have appropriate funding history for career stage including NRSA (not listed under grants on CV but under awards) and other small grants to support her dissertation work. Pubs to date are in clinical journals – two additional pubs submitted or in revision but not clear in which journals. Publication productivity appears appropriate for recent PhD completion, although I had trouble matching what she mentions in her cover letter (3 pubs during PhD work) with her CV – 2 pubs out. 


B.	Focused program of research
Cover letter states that she is interested in pursuing her dissertation work further with trajectory toward studying the physiological, psychological, and social risk factors of arterial stiffness (as it relates to hypertension risk); then the causal effects of risk factors on arterial stiffness;    then moving to intervention work addressing culturally appropriate interventions for stress relief and for early detection and reduction of arterial stiffness in Korean Americans. Some of these are in line with NIH/NINR strategic plans. 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Her teaching experience is minimal given recent completion of PhD; and remote (’99-’00 and ’07) – the question would be what she needs to teach at DUSON and how prepared she feels to do so, given that she just completed her PhD in May 2011. Perhaps with mentoring she could move into this aspect of the position successfully.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Experience (current) as RN cardiac area seems to be guiding her research to some degree and is relevant given that she may be asked to teach nurses across programs (although may not fit with some more specific clinical MSN tracks). 

E.	Service to the profession
Appears to be appropriately active in professional organizations given the time point in her career. 

F.	 Job stability
Appears stable – has been in graduate studies recently; but clinical positions appear to indicate long-term stability.
G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Biobehavioral research seems to be a good fit with research at DUSON/Duke which would provide her with good collaborative resources. We would have to explore her teaching fit more fully given that her experience doesn’t tell us that up front.</Comment>

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice – Med-surg experience

E.	Service to the profession – limited to participation in mostly school committees. Served as treasurer for AICO (not sure what this is) 

F.	 Job stability – has been in number of positions for short periods of time

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – Has experience working in Africa.

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No evidence of current or past program or research or publications.  I was confused about where she completed her dissertation as one part of her CV lists 1996 at the University of Illinois Chicago, another area says that it is published at the University of Michigan. 


B.	Focused program of research
No.
She has an interest in - Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Africa. But no evidence that she has a program of research in this area. 


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She seems to have a moderate amount of teaching experience with a decade of experience in Congo, and 2 decades teaching in the US. She is currently Associate Professor, and coordinator of Community &amp; Public Health Nursing and Nursing Research - BSN level- at Colorado State University-Pueblo. She has taught Research, Public Health, and Adult Health at Colorado State University-Pueblo, Wyoming University. 


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She has some adult acute care clinical experience as an RN. 


E.	Service to the profession
Has some school of nursing committee service. 


F.	 Job stability
Seems to have worked for short periods of time across institutions. 


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Possibly Global Health; Community Health.  But overall does not seem to fit any of DUSON current needs.

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
This candidate has had her PhD for 9 years.  She documents no research funding (or even grants submitted).  She has several publications that would seem appropriate for the anesthesia field, but the latest one of those was in 2003.  She also lists being “contributing editor” of an online anesthesia journal, but gives no indication of what she has published in that role.  This is quite weak in my opinion.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
There is no indication of any “program of research,” despite the fact that her letter, she states that her “interests in pursuing research were (and still are) thriving.  Her letter also says that her “scholarly activities at this time are extremely comprehensive and wide ranging” but then goes on to list what she teaches, what committees she serves on, and the fact that she advises students.  I do not see these as “scholarly activities” as they are described here, and I see no focus to her work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
I must admit to being confused here.  She indicates she has been an Assistant Professor at Wayne State in the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences for 10 years, but she has been only an “adjunct faculty” in their Graduate Program of Nurse Anesthesiology (since 1999).  What does this mean?  What does she do in the NURSE Anesthesia program?  Under “select professional presentations-seminar lecture topics,” she lists about 20 topics … are these guest lectures she has given in Nursing?  None of these “professional presentations” indicate any conference, so I’m assuming they are all seminar lecture topics.  She may have great strength and good experience in teaching, but I’m confused about how much of that has been in nursing.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Has extensive experience as a nurse anesthetist, and has experience as a manager/administrator in the clinical setting.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Actively involved – particularly in ANAA – for quite some time.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Does not seem to be a concern.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Although she has had experience as an administrator in the practice setting, she documents no such experience or any kind of leadership role in an academic setting.  To me, this is a weakness for a candidate for the Assistant Director position.  I also think her scholarly contributions are limited, and am concerned that her teaching experience in nursing may be limited as well.  Overall, I do not see this as a strong candidate, but I would not argue strongly against a phone interview to clarify some of the questions raised above.

ADDITIONAL NOTE …
I was shocked to see Track Changes in her CV.  Perhaps my less-than-positive review of this candidate has been influenced by this.</Comment>

No research, funding, publications, or professional presentations documented.  Completed PhD in Nursing (in India) in 2010 and is now pursuing a Doctor of Science in Nursing, expecting to finish in 2011.  Has had master’s since 2005.  

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
No indication of any focused program of scholarship.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has taught community health (which is the focus of his master’s degree) in 3 different schools for a total of approximately 6 years.  All teaching experience, however, has been in India.  How well would he know the U.S. system?

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
No clinical practice documented in CV.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Indicates no membership or involvement in professional associations, etc.

JOB STABILITY  …  
In current position for 1.5 years; position prior to that was held for 4 years.  Before that, all appointments were for limited periods of time.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Although this candidate’s master’s preparation is in community health and he has taught that for several years, I am uncertain about his knowledge of the U.S. academic system.  Additionally there are no scholarly or practice strengths noted.  I recommend a regret letter.</Comment>

<Comment>Flanagan-Phone Screen
What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Want to obtain a full-time faculty position in the clinical track. I am an educator at heart and want to bring experience and expertise to the classroom. In the long-term I would like to move to a tenure track position after I have developed teaching expertise and scholarship.

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
I am a believer in Duke’s mission to serve the community. When I moved to Durham I could not get a job at Duke so I went to UNC and got a job and stayed there until now. I have colleagues who are very happy at Duke

What are your strengths?
I am a facilitator of learning and a good teacher based on student evaluation. I have taught on-line and face-to-face. I have been successful working with adult learners and facilitating collaboration in knowledge acquisition. I value the life of the leaner outside of classroom. 

What are your weaknesses?
I have a difficult time delegating so sometimes I can get overwhelmed.
What is your most significant accomplishment?
Being able to have nurses come back to me and say I made a difference and motivated them to pursue advanced education makes me proud.

What is your teaching passion?  
My teaching passion is women’s/child health and health promotion in all populations. 
I prefer teaching face-face but I am able to teach on-line. I have taught in the NP program at UNC in school of nursing. I have also taught classes in the school of public health. In school of public health, I teach face-to face, conduct webinars and in class training courses. I have high standards in my training classes. Most people get into their head conferences or workshops when I say I teach continuing education. However my courses are not like that they look academic with a syllabus, readings, outcomes and lesson plans.

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Defense date is October 4th. Original date was June 28, 2011. The statistics professor wanted me to rework the data
My interest in research is obesity prevention and management with a focus on lifestyle change. My dissertation looks at cardiovascular disease prevention of women in prison. I want to expand on this in the future exploring health promotion in vulnerable populations to prevent obesity examining weight maintenance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

What are your practice interests?
The areas of, Women’s health, obesity and health promotion.

Question from search committee
I clarified her dissertation defense date which is October 4, 2011. Information on CV was a typo and she resubmitted a new CV.
Scholarship
My plan is to submit at least 3 articles from my dissertation within the next 12 months. I have identified journals for them and one submission is a requirement of the program. 

Service
I have completed service to the school on a number of committees and I serve on 2 committees with the Department of Public Health in Durham (TAC committee for women’s health and Advisory board of Enhanced nursing program) along with those listed on the CV. 

Similarities to current role and faculty role
Don’t have experience teaching undergraduate students. It will be challenge to learn this skill but my ability to focus on the needs of my students and assess the abilities of the students will remain the same. 
She told me she took education courses during Masters and PhD education During her PhD program she took a course from Dr. Oermann and an additional course in the School of Education. Did not know the name but could provide the information.

She is ready to go to work ASAP preferably by September of 2011. A Low salary would be a deal breaker.</Comment>

<Comment>Edie-Interview Guide for Faculty Telephone Screening Interviews
•	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short –term goal is to develop my teaching experience. I have taken some teaching classes in my DNP course work and a faculty position will give me more opportunities to expand. In the long-term I am interested in furthering experience in research and scholarship. 
•	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
I have been involved in the Duke community for 5 years. My husband is faculty at Duke and we are proud of Durham and the community. So coming to Duke seems natural.
•	What are your strengths?
My strengths are my clinical expertise and work with vulnerable populations. I am also dedicated to community initiatives. I am also strong and comfortable with research process.
•	What are your weaknesses?
I would like to co-teach with another faculty member to learn more about teaching in the classroom.  I am going to be taking classroom strategies in my DNP program in the fall.
•	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Completing the DNP will be a major accomplishment. I will complete my course work in December of 2011 and my capstone in May 2012.
•	What is your teaching passion?
I like empowering students to learn and be responsible for their own learning. I am learner centered and believe educators must do what they need to assist learners in applying knowledge.

•	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?

My research interests are health disparities and health promotion in women and adolescents. Want to continue with community based research and explore a more in-depth understanding of the interest of homeless women. Creating a stronger partnership and knowledge of the needs of populations like those at Genesis home where I do clinical for Duke. 
•	What are your practice interests?
I love adolescents. I am hopeful that I will be able to do practice 10-25% of the time at least that would be my dream. 
•	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
What would you need to support you at Duke? I would need some mentorship to grow in role as a faculty member.
You had a gap in employment from 2001-2007. Why?  2001 family transitioned for Savannah to Durham. Once my family transitioned, I focused on being a mom and it was difficult to break into the market. Came to Duke in fall of 2006.
Would you be willing to work under contract for one year until you completed DNP with the potential for moving to faculty at a later time? Sure I would be open for that discussion but would like to know more about what that would look like.</Comment>

She seems very successful in her research as doctoral student and other research work at UNC. She has very little teaching experience and didn&apos;t seem prepared to answer any questions about teaching, although stated she feels she would work to be prepared and likes teaching areas she is interested in. She mentioned interviewing at other schools and feels Duke is her first choice, which may present a timing issue if we&apos;re waiting until Fall to interview then to start later…. Given her research work to date during and following doctorals studies (and since she is local) I would recommend a campus visit to allow her the opportunity to interview along with other Jr Researcher candidates and get a good comparative look.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
At completion of postdoctoral fellowship, he has participated in studies as a PI and co-I as well as research assistant positions. Two submissions to NIH in June of this year are pending (both as PI  -- one R03 and one K01). I am a little surprised that these are his first independent submissions since he completed postdoc at UNC in 2007. Multiple peer reviewed publications in esteemed journals (public health/sociology/medicine), many of which are first author pubs.


B.	Focused program of research
Overall focus appears to be health disparities in aging; also a focus on disparities in CVD and survival/rehospitalization (outlined in cover letter).


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Only teaching experience appears to be in sociology in stats course as TA. Would likely need mentoring in terms of teaching role as new faculty member, although it seems any of the junior researcher candidates would as well.


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A – sociology background


E.	Service to the profession
Assoc editor of major health behavior/sociology journal.


F.	 Job stability
He has been in research associate positions at Duke (most recently Aging Center) for many years now – started in 2007. 


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
His work in behavioral science, health disparities, and aging/CVD fits very well with others at DUSON. In this way, he would be a great match. His teaching experience is very limited, which comes with this stage of career and would mean that mentoring is needed.
I would be interested in hearing more about the “multidisciplinary” nature of his work since his background is in sociology and all the references are to MDs. Does he work with any nurses in his research now? What does he feel he specifically brings to a school of nursing? I would recommend a phone screen to determine these things and any other questions people may have.</Comment>

<Comment>PHONE SCREEN  …  08.15.11

What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
In the next 3-5 years, Dr. Carman wants to get more preparation in teaching and teach BSN students in class.  “I’m a novice educator but want to use my experience as a clinician, CE educator and preceptor to teach.”  Her longer term goals are to teach online and at the MSN level … maybe even starting an NP track with a focus on emergency care.  She hopes to remain clinically active, at least on a part-time basis, throughout her teaching career.

Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Dr. Carman recently signed an agreement with DUSON’s ABSN program to be a full-time Clinical Associate for 1 year, teaching foundations (with Beth Phillips) in the fall and adult health (with Lisa Day?) in the spring.  She wants to get into a FT teaching role and would hope to be able to transition to that, should she be offered a FT position and provided such an appointment would not leave the ABSN program “short” [my word, not hers].  She seems ethically committed to fulfilling her responsibility this year, though she would love to be FT.

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She has a strong connection to Duke, likes large learning institutions (she “grew up” at Yale), and sees this as a great “fit” for her.  She is local and devoted to the community.  She likes the emphasis on science in DUSON’s mission and philosophy, and she is excited about opportunities to work collaboratively with the SOM, PT and others, asserting that we must eliminate the silos that have characterized health professions fields and practice.

What are your strengths?
Independence, lifelong learner, often chooses the uphill road (rather than the easy way out), looks for new challenges, leads by example (especially with students), willing to try new things, supports and encourages others.

What are your weaknesses?
“Sometimes I’m a bit of a pushover” meaning I sometimes take on more than I should and don’t push others to take on their own responsibilities.  I can be stubborn, and I sometimes blame myself too much.”

What is your most significant accomplishment?
“Personally, it’s my children, ages 25, 22 and 8.  Professionally, I’ve come a long way locally and nationally in establishing the role of NPs in the ED; much of this work has been done through ENA.”

What is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online
The ideal would be a class of about 15 students, small group discussion of issues, connecting clinical experiences to classroom and lab.  She would love to teach ED care, and she’d be interested in incorporating online learning with face-to-face learning.  She understands that the ABSN program has large classes, and thinks she can manage that, but smaller groups (particularly in an MSN program) would be her ideal.

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Dr. Carman says she is interested in looking more at pursuing evidence-based programs and leading nurses (e.g., in free-standing Eds) in how to approach problems and improve practice, using evidence.

What are your practice interests?
As noted above, the candidate would like to remain clinical active (at least on a PT) basis throughout her teaching career.</Comment>

<Comment>Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
No significant funding record (last grant ended in 2003 and there is no indication of grant submission since then).  Last published research article looks like it was in 2001.  Last presentation was in 2000.

Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.
An experienced administrator, holding positions of department chair and dean.  Was dean of engineering at SUNY-Troy for 1 year and dean of A&amp;S at Cheyney U for 5 years.  Letter documents accomplishments as administrator, but no experiences are in nursing.

Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research
Extremely limited and “old” as noted above

2. Teaching
Claims to have extensive teaching, but it’s all been in Physics, etc.

3. Professional Service
	Does not list any leadership positions in professional associations, etc.

Potential to be a thought leader
With no background in nursing, I can’t imagine how this candidate would be a thought leader at DUSON or in the nursing community.

Potential as a coordinator  and team builder in complex organizations
One might assume this in light of the positions held, but no evidence to support such a conclusion

Job stability
Of great concern to me … Lists no job since 2009 … Last job was less than 1 year … Prior to that, the length of positions was 1 year, 4 years, 5 years, 1 year, and then 7 and 11 years.  Seems to have stability earlier in career, but not of late.

Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON
No match at all.  Not a nurse, no indication of any collaboration with nursing, and would not meet BON or CCNE requirements.  Do not pursue.</Comment>

<Comment>Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
Consistent record of grant funding .. many are intramural, but she does have an R21, 3 R03’s and an R01.  She has been the PI on all but 1 of the grants listed.  Consistent record of publications … in reputable journals.  All are consistent with her stated area of expertise – dual disorders of addiction and pain.

Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.
At UCLA for 15 years, progressing from Assistant Professor to Professor.  Serving as ADAA for last 2 years, but no academic administrative experience prior to that.  There is no real cover letter, so it’s hard to know the scope of her responsibility; this lack of clarity is complicated for me by her CV which lists her as Professor &amp; ADAA at UCLA School of Nursing Acute Care Nursing.  Does this mean each clinical area has its own ADAA and she is in that position for Acute Care???  No indication of collaborative work at the university level.

Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research
As noted above, experienced as a researcher, with a consistent record of funding and publication.

2. Teaching
Extensive teaching experience, particularly in 3 areas – physiology/patho, theory construction/development, and advanced practice neuropsych nursing.  Does not describe any roles in course or curriculum development, program evaluation, or dissertation advisement.

3. Professional Service
Is somewhat involved in professional associations, but no significant leadership positions noted.  She lists serving on the review board of 16 different journals and on the editorial board of 4 journals … How can one person do all of that???  She is actively involved at the school, medical center and university levels at UCLA.

Potential to be a thought leader
Lists several honors/awards, but only her induction into AAN strikes me as impressive.  What is impressive to me, however, is her appointments to several advisory boards and expert panels which attest to her expertise in her area of clinical practice/research.  While she may be a “thought leader” in her area of clinical expertise, there is no indication that she can be – or even has any interest in being – a thought leader in education.

Potential as a coordinator  and team builder in complex organizations
Unable to assess this based on her CV alone.  Without a cover letter that describes work she has done to build teams or function as a leader in complex organizations, I cannot judge this.

Job stability
All clinical and research appointments were very short, as were her lecturer appointments at Southern CT State and Yale.  However, she has been at UCLA for 15 years, so would seem to present no concerns in this area.

Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I have concerns about this candidate for the ADAA position.  First of all, she did not bother preparing any kind of cover letter to tell us about her, her experiences, her passions, her goals, etc.  Second, the only reason she notes in her e-mail message is that she is “looking to re-locate to the southeast” … this says nothing about her interest in DUSON or that she even bothered to find out about anything we do.  Finally, I am concerned about what she says on page 1 of her CV in terms of her career objective …  “To study and provide effective evidence-based and humanistic care to individuals suffering from the dual disorders of addition and pain, and their families, with the goal of promoting optimal functionality and ongoing recovery.”  This is a most laudable career objective, but it gives no indication of her interest in leadership in education.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
Applicant identifies area of research interest as decision making, cognitive processes, and self-management in chronic illness. PI Research funding has been small pilot money with the greatest amount being $9393 in 2002. He was a consultant on R01 grant 2004-08. He completed a post-doc at University of Michigan in 2002 with a focus on cognitive function. He has authored (9)o9 or co-authored (15) 24 papers. Of these papers, 11 are data-based. 

B.	Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems. From his cover letter he states that he has been engaging in academic leadership for nearly 5 years.  Associate Chair, Adult Health Nursing (05-6). Director of Generalist Education (06-present). Assistant Dean, Office of Academic Affairs (09-present). Director, Center of Excellence in Nursing Ed and Innovation and Scholarship (08-present). He did complete the AACN Leadership for Academic Nursing program (08-09). He has 20 years of consulting outside of his university and has held membership and leadership positions in local, regional, and national/international organizations (MNRS, Sigma Theta Tau,  AACN, NCSBN)

C.	Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research. Limited to pilot study work. 

2. Teaching. Has won both CI and Teaching awards at Rush.

3. Professional Service. He has 20 years of consulting outside of his university and has held membership and leadership positions in local, regional, and national/international organizations (MNRS, Sigma Theta Tau,  AACN, NCSBN)


D.	Potential to be a thought leader. He states in his cover letter that he “regularly reflect on my behavior and reactions, and use that reflection to guide my interactions and decisions… strive to create an environment of collegiality and transparency with faculty colleagues and students “   He states that he has facilitated change in an academic environment, and firmly established the hallmarks of his  leadership style:  vision, innovation, and collaboration.  Another important leadership characteristic is my ability to mentor and develop educators, especially younger faculty, by inspiring them toward excellence and assisting in their development as expert teachers.  I cannot determine his ability to be a thought leader from these statements and we have the IEE and its Director who facilitate much of the work he highlights in his cover letter.

E.	Potential as a coordinator  and team builder in complex organizations. His cover letter speaks to this skill, but again it has been in the past few years. In his role as Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs (NOTE: This role is not reflected on the Rush Website) he has  worked closely with the Associate Dean and Program Directors to determine and implement the strategic goals of the Office of Academic Affairs.  He states that he has significant input into the vision and direction of this office.  Additionally, he has administrative and operational oversight over the several areas within the Office of Academic Affairs:  (1) admissions, progressions, and advising processes; (2) development of the teaching workload (in collaboration with the department chairs); and, (3), in conjunction with the College’s Director of Evaluation, he shares responsibility for the continuous quality improvement process of the generalist curriculum.  This activity involves developing the evaluation measures, analyzing the data, and recommending changes to the curriculum committee based on those findings.  

F.	 Job stability. No concerns. Has been at Rush since 2003.

G.	Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Dr. Hicks is early in his development as an Academic Leader. His current school of nursing is not a research intensive university, he has very limited research experience and he has in the past several years moved into the three roles he list on his CV. I do not recommend further follow-up of this candidate for the ADAA role.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
No – Much of his work is in the area of student advisement programming, athletic/academic success, and other areas of program planning in academics. I do not see this as a good fit for our needs in terms of health care knowledge, research, education and programs. Grant funding has primarily been again from local organizations for academic (undergrad) advisement, counseling and program planning. 

B.	Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.
He has had progressive academic experience including current position as Executive Director of the Center for Counseling, Advising, &amp; Acad. Support but this is in undergrad/community college settings and not related to health professions/nursing/grad programs which we should need based on programs here.

C.	Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research
See section A. I am concerned with lack of large extramural funding experience given that we are a research institution.

2. Teaching
Instructor and adjunct professor at a few institutions since 1989; many are graduate level; area is psychology. Potentially could fit in terms of teaching research courses but still some concern about lack of nursing background related to fully understanding programs here.

3. Professional Service
Active in organizations – psychology, counseling, student athletes. Community service listed but not clear if all current due to lack of dates. Consults with other schools/programs on ADA, student athlete and advisement issues. 

D.	Potential to be a thought leader
It seems he has potential in this area but in topic areas not necessarily relevant to our school and programs – again, that is a major concern in terms of fit.

E.	Potential as a coordinator  and team builder in complex organizations
Good potential in this area based on his experience with academic advising programs and consulting with institutions regarding this and student athlete issues/programs. However, again, I don’t see relevant expertise to our school.


F.	 Job stability
Multiple positions listed on CV. Longest was about 8 years but the number and short length of many of the positions makes me at least want to question further regarding potential stability. 


G.	Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON

While this candidate is successful in his field of psychology, counseling, student advisement and academic affairs in prior institutions, I don’t see his fit with DUSON. As noted above, I don’t believe that his research background is a match or qualifies him for this position. While some of his skills and background may be valuable here, I don’t see him as enough of a match to pursue his application further.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Statistical consultation and work on grants, publications – all appear appropriate for career stage (completed postdoc 2010).


B.	Focused program of research
Areas of multivariate analysis and statistical work appear to fit needs and preferences indicated in position announcement.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Limited experience teaching in statistical courses in Alberta and China. Courses taught seem to fit with program needs for teaching at DUSON. 


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A


E.	Service to the profession
Member of statistical organizations and serves on a conference committee/one journal as reviewer. Seems appropriate for career stage and assume it would grow over time. 


F.	 Job stability
Appears appropriate given doctoral and postdoctoral work and then consultation on funded projects.


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Statistical areas of expertise appear to align with position announcement and specific areas listed that are needed (although I’d leave this up to further input from the current DUSON statistical experts to more fully determine). Although overall teaching experience is limited, it appears the candidate would be prepared to teach some of the current stats courses at DUSON given listed TA and teaching roles to date. I would suggest a phone screen to get a better sense of this information.</Comment>

<Comment>I copied this from Terry Valiga&apos;s email about her phone interview to capture the conclusion which was not in TV&apos;s previous note:
My phone interview/screen with Meg Carman is posted in the DB.  She is currently teaching FT at DUSON as a Clinical Associate in the ABSN program and has a 1-year agreement for that, but she is very interested in a FT position.  It seems her passion is to teach in an MSN program, but she understands she would teach ABSN students for a few years.  To be honest, I’m not sure she is a particularly strong candidate for a FT faculty position at this point.  I will look forward to talking about this candidate at our next meeting.  Thanks.</Comment>

<Comment>Overall Comment: 
This candidate has extensive experience in nursing education administration and instruction, program assessment and development, clinical practice operations, grant and resource management.  Ten years ago she served as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs ( 1992-2001).  Currently (since 1992) she is an Associate Professor at the University of Cincinnati
&amp; Deputy-Director of Nursing for NIOSH sponsored Educational Research Center 2011-Present. 

I am concerned about her scholarly productivity:  Her research funding has been limited and inconsistent. This may be appropriate because of her leadership positions and also the nature of her area of research in the field of leadership and administration.  But her publication record is well below what would be expected for her career stage.  

Specific Comments:
Areas of Evaluation

<Comment>Overall: 
Currently a postdoctoral fellow at UNC-CH T32 Institutional Research Training Grant in Healthcare Quality and Patient Outcomes.  She Is also pursuing master’s degree in Biostatistics at UNC-CH School of Public Health (it is unclear when she will have completed). 
This candidate appears to be an aspiring, independent, and very hard working new investigator. She has made the most of her opportunities at UNC-CH and has learned some interesting methods of analysis that would be a good fit here.  Her area of research focus in cancer disparities and methods of analysis make her a very good match for Duke. 

She has very limited teaching experience. 

I recommend for a phone screen. 


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Excellent level of funding for career stage: Post doc funding.  ANA dissertation funding.  Several small research awards. 
Excellent level of publication productivity: 10 peer-reviewed, data-based articles in the last five years


B.	Focused program of research
Area of patient safety outcomes of medication errors. 
Dissertation: she developed and tested a model of how organizational factors differentially affected the incidence of severe and nonsevere errors.
Postdoc: program of research in the area of population-based cancer control and surveillance. Focus in this area is to understand and reduce disparities in cancer incidence, treatment, and outcomes. Investigating how organizational factors affect the pattern of care cancer patients receive, whether certain organizational factors reduce racial disparities in cancer treatment, and how the timing of therapy affects cancer patients’ survival.

Plans to apply for a K01 award through NCI to focus on disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes. 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Teaching experience limited to teaching assistant in the UNC master’s program for two semesters.

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
Candidate is up for promotion to professor and would be eligible for tenure track. She states, “My own scholarly activity has been persistent, but my research has been subject to periods without substantial funding until more recent years. My dissertation and subsequent research examined the leadership behaviors of leaders in key organizational positions and leader/follower behaviors and expectations in academic and healthcare organizations. As would be expected, funding for these studies was sparse, since the findings were neither outcome focused nor translational in nature.” Has gap between 1998 and 2010.
Her record of publication is also limited with only 5 first authored pubs since 2001. Publications also demonstrate the gap 
She was VP of operations from 2001-2009 which may be why her scholarship demonstrates inconsistency

B.	Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.

Her CV demonstrates she has experience with faculty, student and staff constituencies similar Duke in size and scope of responsibility.  She has served on several university based committees as well as school of nursing committees.  Her CV highlights activities or accomplishments related to her role as ADAA. These involve designing and revising RN/BSN AMSN, and doctoral programs. She also was instrumental in design, reorganizing and restructuring learning resources (learning lab, computer lab, interactive televelsion classroom). 	

C.	Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)
1.	Research
CV demonstrates lack of substantial extramural funding. Just started to acquire funding in 2010-11
2.	Teaching
CV demonstrated a number of teaching roles across all programs.  She has teaching expertise in classroom, clinical and on-line instruction. She has done a number of book reviews and presentations at national conferences. She has also served as chair on capstone, dissertation and master thesis committees.  Not sure if I missed it but oddly enough she has not be recognized for teaching excellence. 

3. Professional Service
She is Deputy Director of Nursing for NIOSH 2011. Active in national, local and university level committees in service roles. She has also served as a consultant supporting leaderships and shared governance implementation. She is also a CCNE and NLN program evaluator

D.	Potential to be a thought leader
She says she was an early adopter of instructional technology, she was a key player in an entrepreneurial business venture and a facilitator and implementation consultant for shared governance models in hospital. This demonstrates to me she has potential to be a thought leader.
	

E.	Potential as a coordinator and team builder in complex organizations
Her roles in consulting for the implementation of shared governance models and service on university level committees say she is capable of facilitating these type processes. 
F.	 Job stability
She is currently an Associate professor at University of Cincinnati since 1992 and up for promotion this year.

G.	Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I think her gaps in research and publication make sense because of her other business venture.  I think she warrants a phone screen and further exploration as a candidate because of her nursing education and academic leadership experience.</Comment>

<Comment>RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Post-doc (T32) at UNC &amp; dissertation support from ANF/SNRS. Only other research funding is from STTI chapter &amp; Seoul Nurses Association.  Good publication record – 3 in 2011, 2 in 2010, 4 in 2009 &amp; 2 in 2008 – in journals that appear to be well-respected ones.  Has had PhD since 2007, so publication record is good, but funding record seems a bit weak.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Letter indicates program of research is “in the area of population-based cancer control &amp; surveillance” and a “focus on disparities in cancer treatment &amp; outcomes.”  Grant funding does not align with these foci but some publications do.  To be honest, if this statement was not in the cover letter, I’m not sure I ever would have concluded that this is the program of research for this candidate.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Very limited teaching experience despite MPH since 2002 and PhD since 2007.  Only teaching experience noted was 1 academic year at a TA at UNC.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Licensed in NY, though lives in NC.  Most recent clinical practice was as a staff nurse in Korea (4 years).

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Reviewer for 3 journals (including Western J of Nursing Research), but documents no active involvement or leadership in any of the associations of which she is a member.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Other than 4 years as a staff nurse, her “jobs” have been as an RA (1 year in Korea), TA (1 year at UNC), RA (7 years at UNC), and social research specialist (whatever that is … sorry, but I don’t know)(3 years at UNC).  This does not say “job stability” to me.  Her longest “stint” was as an RA with Barbara Mark, though I wonder about the length of that work … why stay on as an RA once she earned her PhD?

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I do not see great strength here as someone who could contribute to DUSON.  She seems not to have made any commitment to anything, and that worries me.  I suggest we do not pursue this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>I did not bother filling out the form on this candidate because I do not think he is qualified at all.  He is not a nurse and would have no understanding of what&apos;s involved in teaching the practice of nursing, conducting nursing research, engaging in clinical practice, etc. And while he has spent many years in academic settings, he has never been a FT faculty member, and all of his positions -- though at the director/chair/executive director level -- are more STAFF than academic.  I do not see this candidate to be at all viable for the ADAA position at DUSON.</Comment>

Interview Guide for Faculty Telephone Screening Interviews
A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Note: I asked about whether he had completed postdoc at UNC – states he is in second year but if this position needed to start sooner,  can negotiate to complete earlier 
Short term – progession  on tenure track (did try to discuss research vs. tenure track with him in answer to his questions)
Long term – build reputation and become strong in field
B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
N/A- in postdoctoral position 
C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Duke is well known university 
Past experience at Alberta in SON and liked environment.
D.	What are your strengths?
Experience in consulting 
Previous teaching experience
Methodology- exploring new directions
E.	What are your weaknesses?
Good at writing but need more experience/editing would help in progress.

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Work with professor on paper/project as PhD student and had published within 6 months – fast turnaround. Accomplished most of it on his own. 
G.	What is your teaching passion?
Previous experience limited but comfortable in small class (20-30) and has taught big class (100). Most in undergraduate ; one brief experience in graduate teaching. All experience in classroom; none online. 

H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Working on new functional data with own methodology project; also collaborating with others with functional data. Previous work on survey data with faculty in SON. Also experience in longitudinal data that would like to pursue further – project with U of Washington – trajectory analysis involving BP. 
I.	What are your practice interests?
N/a
J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
This phone screen was somewhat difficult given that English is his second language and I struggled mostly when he was describing specific statistical methods and had to ask him to repeat terms. However, we have faced that in previous candidate screens and still brought them in. His experience in a school of nursing in Alberta (that he really enjoyed) adds to his fit for this position. I got the sense based on some of his questions that we may have to clearly outline the position expectations and teaching, etc. Otherwise, I didn’t see any responses or issues that make him any less qualified than the other two candidates and able to be brought in for a campus interview, especially since he is local.</Comment>

Currently adjunct faculty at Virginia Commonwealth University for an on-line Management &amp; Leadership course, which he has have taught for two years. Reports that his student evaluations have improved consistently with experience.

D.	 Relevance and extent of clinical practice. As described above

E.	 Service to the profession.  He is a member of ANA and AACN (critical care). He lists some leadership positions, but does not identify any professional organizations. He has been a Habitat volunteer for 13 years.

A.	Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
Appears to have good track of funding but is all HRSA funding and given that and fairly limited peer reviewed, data based publications (outside of chapters, etc) for current rank, it does not seem that same rank would be applicable here at Duke.

B.	Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.
Has prior experience in applicable administrative roles including current position as Director, School of Nursing and Executive vice dean (Ohio University). 


C.	Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research
Appears to be limited to HRSA grant funding. Limited data based publications.

2. Teaching
Applicable experience in needed areas for DUSON (online courses; policy; NP courses; Research).

3. Professional Service
   Professional membership and service in relevant organizations (Sigma, NP orgs, NLN) however no leadership positions in these national organizations at a national level. 

D.	Potential to be a thought leader
It appears there is potential given current position as executive vice dean; however I don’t see direct evidence of this in CV.

E.	Potential as a coordinator  and team builder in complex organizations
Current position much require coordination of programs and teams. I’m concerned that because of different programs and environment, that this position would be very different from her current environment and position.


F.	 Job stability
Appears to be stable – many positions but all for relatively stable time periods.


G.	Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Would not recommend pursuing further due to lack of funding/publications to fit rank; lack of experience in environment like DUSON (research institution with many competitive programs including doctoral level).</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation
A.            Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
This candidate has had one grant funded with 3 additional submitted.  She listed 3 pubs for 2011.  She does not list any other pubs prior to 2011.  This is less than what I would expect for an educator with 7 years of experience – however she has probably been in her DNP program for a portion of her time as an educator.
B.            Focused program of research
No
C.            Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has taught within an FNP program for 7 years however she does not list the specific courses she has taught so I do not want to assume her teaching experience is congruent.
D.            Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She appears to have relevant clinical practice as an FNP in a wide variety of clinical practice areas.  In addition she has developed a faculty practice which she is currently engaged in at 10% effort.
E.            Service to the profession
She has clear evidence of community and professional service.  She is a journal and textbook reviewer; she is a member of a few professional organizations; she has also had leadership positions in the NCNA organization.
F.            Job stability
No issues identified
G.           Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I believe she may be a fit with the FNP program.  I would like to inquire about the courses she has taught in the past.  

I recommend a phone screen for this candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  Do not pursue

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Very weak in this area.  1 refereed publication in 2008, 3 presentations (2 of which were at the same conference in 2007 and the 3rd of which was in 1984).  No indication of funding, grant writing.  Only research documented seems to be his dissertation.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
None is evident

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Very weak.  Adjunct faculty at VCU since Spring 2010, though responsibilities are not clear.  Other “teaching experience” has been as a teaching fellow and a TA.  No indication that he has had any responsibility for developing or teaching a course, advising students, using online systems, etc.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Extensive experience in the clinical setting, primarily in some kind of administrative role.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Documents membership in professional associations, but no committee or leadership roles in them. He does note that he was chair of the “Pathway to Excellence Task Force” and a few other groups, but it’s not clear where those roles were fulfilled or whether they were part of his job as a clinical administrator.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Seems to have had many “short stints” at a lot of jobs.  Most recent positions were in NC and MD, but nearly all of them prior to that were in TX, so it’s not that he moved around a lot.  I get concerned when I see this kind of history.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I do not see this as a strong candidate, and I’m not convinced that he would make any particularly unique contribution to DUSON.</Comment>

Shelley Y. Hawkins:   Applicant for FNP position

Recommend:  Campus Visit

Has held Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Program Director position at University of Virginia and FNP program director position at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Has had faculty position at Yale.  

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term:  wants to continue to develop program of research.  While in academia over the past 20 years she has had a good program of scholarship (HRSA grants, publications) but did not have intensive research program.  So she went back to school after being in academia for 20 years and completed a post doc at UNC-CH in chronic illness. .
Interested in conducting research, teaching at the doctoral level.  In particular very interested in DNP teaching given the significant background as NP and NP educator. 

Long term:  Develop a program of research.  Emphasis on use of telemedicine to deliver interventions for chronic illness elderly populations.   Wants a position where she has some stability.  Her husband died while she was at UVA. Thus she had to move around several times for personal reasons. 

B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
-was in academia for 25 plus years. 
-presently in a corporate position that came out of her research.  Last faculty position at Yale SON. Was doing a pilot study there using iPhones.  The company that lent the iPhones and funded the study offered her a corporate position.  This position allowed her the flexibility to be at home in Alabama with new husband. 

 Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  

Reputation.  Has been in academia at top tier schools.  Wants to continue this.  While doing post doc at UNC-CH she met several DUSON faculty and was very impressed with the work we are doing.  Met and spoke with Ellie McConnel at one of the GSA conferences.  Was very impressed with her. 
Interested in working in a school that is rich in gerontology.
Likes the location near the research triangle. 

C.	What are your strengths?
Team player. While much of the successful work in academia is done individually, she really enjoys working with as  a team.  Has an excellent work ethic.  Was invited/nominated as a fellow in the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.   Strong communication skills. 

D.	What are your weaknesses?
Has a tendency to initially see the positive/good in everyone and sees them as passionate about roles and responsibilities as she is.  Has learned from instances when this has not worked out.  Wishes she had a keener eye at picking this up so that expectations are not dashed. 

E.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Being nominated as a fellow in the AANP.  It recognized her passion, expertise for advanced practice nursing

F.	What is your teaching passion?
Favorite or preference is to teach in seminar style. Feels she is highly effective in a setting with a smaller group of students (10-12).   But she has taught in a range of class size.  Really likes to teach on chronic illnesses.  Likes to teach about roles and professional obligations given her extensive experience as NP .  
•	Class size
•	Clinical groups
•	Online:  has taught both synchronous and asynchronous.  This type of teaching fits well with her area of research interest in telemedicine. 
G.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Just completed a pilot using the iPhone 4 with older adults with diabetes.  Wants to expand sample size and repeat with a chronic illness group.  Would like to experiment with another type of telemedicine.   What is the most feasible telemedicine approach to use with older adults with chronic illness? 
Is interested in writing a K award.  Or an R award.   Needs research mentorship.

H.	What are your practice interests?
Yes.  Is interested in some level of practice.  Most recently participated on a voluntary basis in a clinic. 

I.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Has worked at 4 SONS since 1991:  Yale (2 years); UAB (3 years); UV (4 years);  Auburn (3 years).  She is a widower. Thus she moved several times as a result of personal reasons. Remarried a couple of years ago.  New husband has a business in Alabama and was not able to sell it at the time.  He is now undergoing a merger and the family wants to move to this area for the long term.</Comment>

RECOMMENDATION-Conduct Phone Screen
Candidate:    Allison Dimsdale                                               		 Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Allison currently does not have any research. There is also no mention of the topic of her DNP capstone listed on her CV.
Allison has 2 first authored publications in 2006 &amp; 2009.

B.	Focused program of research

Cardiology is the focus of her clinical practice. Her CV does not have evidence of focused research.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Allison has previous teaching experience in the role of clinical instructor in the NP program here at Duke. 
She has also taught a seminar course &amp; served as a preceptor for DUSON as a clinical associate.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She has been a nurse for 15 years, and has been a certified NP for the past 5 years. She is the clinical lead in cardiology.


E.	Service to the profession

She is a member of several professional organizations (STTI, NCNA, and AACN); however she has not served in service roles in any of them. In her clinical practice she has chaired or held service roles on committees.

F.	 Job stability

This is not an issue.


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

I am recommending a phone screen with this candidate because she comes highly recommended by faculty in the NP program leaving me to believe they think she is a good fit. She demonstrates strength in her expertise and practice. Her teaching experience and scholarship is very weak. A phone screen will capture information about her capstone project and her focus in the area of scholarship. Had she been a candidate unknown to Duke I would have said no.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  Phone screen … to confirm DNP completion &amp; discuss scholarly goals.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Candidate earned the MSN in 2007 &amp; expects to complete the DNP in Spring 2012.  She has had no research funding and documents no grant submissions; however, she was the Clinical Research Coordinator in DCRI for 2 years and has published an article about “playing your part in a clinical trial.”  She has 1 other article in ANP.  There is no mention of the focus of her DNP capstone.  Her scholarly productivity is very limited but also somewhat appropriate for her career stage.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
She indicates so specific direction for her scholarly work, whether it be related to research, practice, or teaching.  I would not expect a focused program of research, but I would expect that she will (someday soon) think about a focus to her scholarly work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Candidate has taught MSN clinical courses at DUSON for 2 years, guest lectured in several courses, and served as a preceptor to nursing and PA students.  She indicates no experience with full responsibility for designing or implementing a course, advising students, functioning as a faculty member, etc. and will need mentoring for these responsibilities.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
She has been a nurse since 1997 and functioned in a variety of clinical roles, including her most recent 4-year position as an NP at Duke.  She is involved in many committees at DUH and chairs a committee working with Bill Fulkerson to advance the practice of NPs, Pas, and CNMs across DUHS, an appointment that I would assume acknowledges her clinical expertise and her leadership ability.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Involved in several AACN committees, and serves as an NP on the State Medical Assistance Team as a volunteer provider with FEMA teams.  She also has been and continues to be actively involved in her community.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No concerns here … Although her position has increased in scope and responsibilities over the years, she has been with Duke since 1998.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Obviously has the support of several DUSON NP faculty and would seem to have the experience and “strong interest in clinical instruction and creative nursing education” (as noted in her resume) that could make her a viable candidate.  Completion of the DNP must be confirmed.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
Phone interview … Strong candidate  …  Clarification about what she thinks she would be contributing here at DUSON is in order.  The position we have advertised and for which she has applied is ABSN-Community Health, yet her cover letter says that she “understands her role will include an emphasis on the graduate community health nursing program and building that program.”  We do not have a graduate community health program.  So is her understanding of the role she would play congruent with what our advertised needs are (ABSN Community Health)?  

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Active scholar, program developer, and public health leader.  She has 2 grants under review, and has received funding from AHRQ, HRSA, Illinois Department of Healthcare &amp; Family Services, some of which were program evaluation grants.  Consistent record of presentations at national and regional conferences, as well as being an invited speaker, most of which clearly focus on public health issues.  She has a 2009 book and instructor’s manual on health program planning &amp; evaluation, and both are 2nd editions.  She has published in journals that would seem to reach public health audiences.  In 2011, she has 3 publications and 3 additional ones “in press;” prior to this year, however, her publications have been somewhat limited (2 in 2010, 1 each in 2009/2008/2007, and 2 in 2006).

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Her focus is clearly on public health issues and meeting the public health needs of communities (in the US and in Chile), with a particular emphasis on prenatal case management.  Her expertise has led to her creating an invitational conference in 2010 to establish a research agenda for public health nursing, the outcomes of which seem to be quite positive.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
This is an experienced teacher who understands the faculty role and who has had responsibility for course design and development, been actively involved in school and university committees, chaired dissertation committees, and served on thesis and dissertation committees.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
She has not personally been a care provider for a number of years, but she clearly is knowledgeable about community/public health practice, community needs, etc.  Received Lillian Wald Public Health Nursing Award from Nursing Section of APHA in 2008 and named a Fulbright Senior Specialist in Chile for 2004-2009.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Very active  …  Serves as editor-in-chief of Health Care Management Review since 2005 and has published many editorials in that role.  Was an invited participant in the RWJF/CDC meeting about setting the research agenda in public health services and systems research.  Active in professional associations.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No concerns here  …  Progressed through the ranks at UIC over last 13 years and taught at UT-Austin for 5 years prior to that.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Clearly an expert in public health, which we need very much in the ABSN program.  This focus and her systems research focus would make for valuable contributions at DUSON.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Highly successful in her specialty area of public health nursing – very appropriate for full clinical professor.
HRSA grants and some R funding (R13).

B.	Focused program of research
Yes- Research funded by HRSA/AHRQ etc in the area of public health nursing. Very relevant given current health care issues and system changes. Expertise in the area of PHN Research which could add greatly to growing focus on this area here at DUSON.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
My only concern is that she has so much expertise in this area but has been teaching master’s /doctoral level courses so I would wonder how she felt about taking on the ABSN CH course and leading that?? It is not clear from her cover letter that she is clear on that being the primary need for this position. 

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Clinical practice looks like it was last in 1986 as director of public health nursing. Has RN experience prior to that time as well. 

E.	Service to the profession
Member of national organizations relevant to professional area of interest and to nursing. Reviewer and advisory board member for many national organizations in her field. No evidence of direct leadership role in the professional organizations.

F.	 Job stability
No issues or concerns noted.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
International connection – to Cuban University.
Public health at grad level could be very helpful at DNP level as well – not clear direct experience in community health at RN level but very successful in this field so could likely have great vision for that as well.

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Bridging the gap between nursing and CFM or Community Health here at Duke is a lofty goal and it would be GREAT if she could work on that. Her expertise could potentially really guide the ABSN CH course into the next phase and could potentially contribute to the DNP/Grad level PH area as well if that could be worked out in her agreement. It could be a lot to take on across programs but that would be something to discuss further.
I would definitely recommend a phone screen.</Comment>

1995-2000: worked in 3 companies as an engineer. 
2000-2004:?? Unclear what she did during this time.
2004-prsent:  masters through doctoral and postdoctoral work.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Her area of research interest would bridge our child health research program with health policy and economics.  I am concerned that her teaching fit would be limited to research design courses (of which we have a surplus of teachers) and health policy.</Comment>

<Comment>Recommendation-Proceed with campus visit.  Candidate is known to us and is local. She was very personable and easy to talk to. She demonstrates strong clinical expertise and the ability to teach which is supported by course work and effectiveness in her role as a clinical associate teaching part-time. Her lack of scholarship and recent change of capstone topic,  without presentation of capstone proposal, is very concerning to me. I think the level of her presentation will confirm or eliminate my questions about her ability to serve and maintain a faculty position.
Allison Walp Dimsdale
What are your goals for a faculty position? 
I am currently working as a clinical associate at Duke. I am doing some part-time teaching and have served as a preceptor. I would like to teach part-time and maintain clinical practice part-time. I will be open for discussion regarding % and the way I can maintain my practice and teaching balance. Practice is very important to me. The deal breaker would be if I had to completely give up my practice
Why duke??
I am Duke born and bred. I am 5th generation Duke in my family. I am totally committed to Duke. I never considered anything else for working or going to school. My daughter is a student at Duke now. It seems like a natural progression.
What are your strengths? 
My people skills are my strength. I am a good communicator and I know how to get my point across. I enjoy teaching students. In the ACLS classes I teach. I always end up with those who are struggling to succeed. It is rewarding for me help students figure out how to learn. I am very comfortable with lecture and like to find creative ways to teach. 
What are you weaknesses? 
Publishing is my weakness. I want to improve in this area and have identified DUSON mentors to support me.
What is your most significant accomplishment? 
My most significant accomplishment is the relationships I have established with my clients. When they feel like the can call me and I can help them, I am pleased with myself. I am also proud of the project I am working on with Dr. Fulkerson and a team to redesign practice for nursing in a cardiology clinic.
1 year ago based on the IOM recommendations, we restructured work in the clinic so nurses were positioned to manage direct patient care, NPs were placed in the role of the provider  for established patients and MD’s are only seeing new admissions. The clinical changed from the more physician directed care model. It has been very successful. 

What is your teaching passion? 
I like working with students who are challenged and need that remediation. I am drawn to them.
I took Dr. Edwards education course this past summer. They were great course.
What are your practice interests? 
My passion is Cardiology nursing. I am interested I patients who have ICD’s and their risk for anxiety. I have a desired to educate this population. My daughter has an ICD so is it a topic which is personal. 
Future research
Originally, I was going to do my capstone looking at anxiety risk in patients with an ICD. I just changed my capstone focus yesterday (September 21, 2011) to look at the changes in quality of care based on our practice redesign. I have the data and I think it is effective. After speak with my advisor we thought this was the best option. I have not done my capstone proposal defense, but don’t think that will take much time. I expect to walk in May and finish my DNP in August.
What contributions would you make to DUSON? 
I am a people person so I think I will bring my energy, my passion for caring for others and my experience as a clinician.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Recommendation: Phone Screen
Candidate:         Diane Kelly                                          		 Position:  Health Policy

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Her research funding and scholarly productivity are limited for her career stage. She has published 3 books and 5 first authored manuscripts in her 9 years as a doctorally prepared faculty. She was the project coordinator for an AHQR research funded project. She says the duration was 6 months and she does not state the amount of the funding.

B.	Focused program of research
She does not have a clear research focus. However, her teaching and professional experiences have always been health care administration, quality and policy.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

She has been teaching since 2000. She has taught primarily on-line, as well as face-to-face across all programs types. Since 2004 she has taught as a consulting associate at Duke,  teaching on-line statistics and population based health care. She is also currently working as adjunct faculty for UNC-CH teaching on-line courses.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Her professional experience is in the area of health care delivery and policy. She has had several professional 
roles to include consulting expert, assistant administrator, and re-engineering specialist.  All of these roles 
have centered around health care delivery systems and quality.

E.	Service to the profession
She is involved in Utah AONE, Utah Health Executives, STTI and on the JCAHO editorial board. 

F.	 Job stability

This is not an issue

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

While her research and scholarship are weak, she has the teaching experience and expertise in health populations, policy and quality to support Dr. Short. She demonstrates the abilities to work with DUSON students and facilitate instruction on-line to student in graduate and undergraduate programs.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
When talking about short and long term goals this candidate focused more on why she wanted to leave Winston-Salem University.  I get a clear picture that she is unhappy with her current position and leadership.  She would like to continue to improve as an educator and practitioner.  She wants to be in an environment that is more respectful of shared governance.  

B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Again, it was very clear that she is looking for a new position because of dis-satisfaction with the leadership at her current university.  She articulates a loss of shared governance over the recent past.  She does not like where the leadership is bringing the school.

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She talks a little about the simulation and technology that we have here at Duke.  She does not talk very much about why she is interested in coming to Duke but more about why she wants to leave her current university.

D.	What are your strengths?
Her strengths are clearly her teaching experience and clinical practice experience.  She has taught a wide variety of courses including women’s health, pediatrics, adult health, roles &amp; transitions, pharmacology, physical assessment, and health care policy and finance.  She speaks about bringing her clinical experience to the classroom to bridge the “practice – theory gap”.

E.	What are your weaknesses?
She states she is “technologically challenged” and “fearful of writing grants”.

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
She describes her most significant accomplishment at her university as development of a faculty practice where she currently practices 1 day per week.  She developed the business model as a component of her DNP capstone project and was able to bring it to life in her community.  She was able to also secure a donated mobile health van and a $300,000 grant which she and other faculty use to bring health care education to the people in her community.

G.	What is your teaching passion?
•	Class size – average about 30-40
•	Clinical groups – has worked as a clinical preceptor for NP students
•	Online – no

H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans? 
N/A – she is clearly interested in a clinical track position, educating clinicians, and maintaining some aspect of a clinical practice.
I.	What are your practice interests?
Her practice interests include delivering culturally competent family practice to underserved populations

J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
N/A

RECOMMENDATION: Hold on a campus visit at this time.  Wait to see how Edie and Dimsdale interview on campus.  I am very much on the fence about this candidate, leaning toward recommending no campus visit, because of her focus on why she wants to leave her current university instead of focusing on why she wants to come to Duke.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate:    GWENDOLYNN D.RANDALL, PhD, CRNA, ARNP                                           			 Position:  NAP Assistant Director

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
She lists one grant to implement her dissertation, no others listed on her CV.  No grant value listed.  No publications listed on her CV.

B.	Focused program of research
No research listed on her CV aside from her dissertation topic of Theory of Community Empowerment.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Unknown.  She lists two assistant professor positions (2003-2005 &amp; 2006-2008) but does not expand upon what she has taught, what her responsibilities were, and what her contributions were.  She also lists a few adjunct faculty positions.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
She is currently president of anesthesia on call.  I do not know if she has any clinical experience with that position.  She has listed a position as staff anesthetist 2009-present.  She has several other per diem positions posted.

E.	Service to the profession
She is very involved within her professional organizations and has held several leadership positions.

F.	 Job stability
She has held many professional positions in her career.  Early in her career she had many 1 -2 year long positions.  In the recent history there are many professional positions listed which seem to overlap in timeframe.  I am not absolutely clear what is a full time position listed on her CV along with her many adjunct and per Diem positions.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
This is hard to say.  I am unsure what she has taught in her 2 short assistant professor positions.  She does not list any manuscripts, grant funding, or presentations on her CV.

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:
Strictly based upon the information in the submitted CV, I am unable to tell if she is a match for this position or not.  I would recommend sending a regret letter based upon the clear lack of scholarship listed on the CV.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Appears  very appropriate for her career stage as junior researcher. Multiple data based, peer reviewed publications; a few first author. On research teams for postdoc currently. 


B.	Focused program of research
In health psychology – risk; mediation and moderation (effects of interventions); health behavior (smoking, cancer risk, etc).


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Brief, limited experience as TA, instructor. She may need mentoring into this part of the position; however it would seem most in a Jr role would come with limited teaching experience. She would like to teach in PhD/grad program.


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A


E.	Service to the profession
Member of professional societies; service/committee participation at 3 universities; ad hoc reviewer for relevant journals given her interest area.


F.	 Job stability
No issues noted


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Seems to fit with some other faculty research interests; would we want more faculty who are not in nursing but rather areas like this (health psychology)? 


H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Research interests and methodological interests could fit well here. I would recommend a phone screen and realize that we need to discuss all Jr Researcher candidates comparatively at next meeting.</Comment>

Scholarship appropriate for career stage.

B.	Focused program of research Her research focus is how relationship partners affect one another’s health. In work with married women (aged 35-85), she examined a model of perceived husband influences on women’s exercise that showed distinct pathways of influence for multiple types of husband influence.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs. She is interested in teaching graduate courses such as research methods and statistics courses as well as health behavior theory and intervention research. Could teach existing statistics courses as well as several courses that are not currently offered (i.e., mediation and moderation). 

D. Relevance and extent of clinical practice. Not applicable

E. Service to the profession. Has served as a reviewer for 3 journals. School service appropriate for career level.

      F. Job stability. Not a concern has been in school for the past.

Candidate:  Devon Noonan                                                 	 Position:  Jr Researcher

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Candidate has small grant funding (STTI, ALA, NIH) to support her research. Candidate has also submitted a R03. Candidate has 3 pubs in press from dissertation and 6 other first authored pubs. 

B.	Focused program of research
Program of research in scholarship and education is clearly health promotion, smoking behaviors and risk and cancer risk in adolescents. Research has potential to obtain funding and interest will link up offer opportunities for interprofessional collaborations with other DUSON faculty.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Candidate has taught 3 years as adjunct faculty (2yrs at UVA and 1 year at community college) and was also adjunct faculty. However her experiences lend themselves to the needs of the ABSN and NP programs. 

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Has clinical experience since 2002 in roles of RN and NP (surgery, respiratory care, pediatrics, adult medicine, HIV, and employee health). Most were 1-2 years however; transition seems to line up with times when candidate was in school.

E.	Service to the profession

Candidate has membership in professional organizations without service roles. However, during doctoral studies served as president and VP of doctoral student nurses association.

F.	 Job stability

Candidate has record of short employment periods, 1-2 years in roles. Not overly concerned but this should be addressed if candidate is screen.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Candidate interest matches those of DUSON. Think candidate would be able to fill teaching needs. Has good start in scholarship and research. I think her focus would also align with health system development of cancer center and programs.</Comment>

<Comment>Recommendation:	Phone interview			 

Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above

Candidate has been at U Maryland since 1996 and a Professor there since 2007.  She has a consistent record of peer-reviewed publications, several of which are data-based; 2 data-based articles are in press.  She has many published abstracts, most of which are in the journal Circulation but none of which are more recent than 2000.  She has received extensive funding from the Maryland Higher Education Commission to complete projects related to faculty (workforce, development, etc.) and in recent years has 1 HRSA program grant and 1 GAANN project funded by USDOE, both of which focus on educators.  Other than this focus, it is difficult to see a pattern in her funded projects as they range from breast health to immunization, quality of life in adults over 60, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, agricultural hazards, diverse populations, and cancer screening.  Prior to this “collection” of foci, her funded projects primarily addressed cardiac problems.  She has a consistent record of presentations at national conferences including, the NIH Health Disparities Conference, CANS, NLN, Association of Standardized Patient Educators, SNRS, and International Meeting on Medical Simulation.

Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.

This candidate served as acting director (for 1 year) and director (for 5 years) of graduate studies at Maryland, and 1 year as acting director of research there.  In more recent years, she has been co-director or director of the standardized patients lab, teaching in nursing and health professions post-graduate certificate program, and institute for educators in nursing and health professions.  Her CV documents no responsibility as department chair, associate dean, or other academic administrative position, though her letter (page 2) speaks to her being director of “these programs.”  The letter does note her role in developing an RN-to-MS program, a revised PhD curriculum, obtaining preliminary accreditation for the Nurse Midwifery specialty, and involvement in writing reports for accreditation or other external reviews.  One would assume that she needed to interact with many individuals to bring these initiatives to life, but I am not sure I see evidence of “managing or overseeing major constituencies and organizational structures/systems.”  This would be an area to explore during a phone interview.

Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research
This candidate’s expertise in measurement and patient outcomes led to her being invited to serve on the planning committee for 2 large clinical trials sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, both of which are reported (in her letter) to have become “landmark studies that dramatically impacted care of patients with lethal arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation.”  She was selected as a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Nurse Scholar in 1985-87 and completed that post-doctoral fellowship at UCSF.  See comments above as well.

2. Teaching
Teaches graduate courses in instructional strategies, assessment of learning, measurement of nursing phenomena, teaching practicum, and special topics in nursing education.  Also serves on dissertation committees as chair, member and consultant; and chairs/serves on thesis committees.  She also has received awards for excellence in teaching/education.

3. Professional Service
A most active, involved professional and “citizen of the academy.”  Serves on national committees, editorial boards and review panels, and is a consultant.

Potential to be a thought leader

This candidate would seem to have the potential to be a thought leader in nursing education, particularly in relation to faculty development, faculty workforce, educational innovations, simulation, the use of standardized patients, measurement, and program outcomes.

Potential as a coordinator and team builder in complex organizations

Many of her publications are jointly authored, as are several of her funded projects.  This combined with her success in professional association work leads one to conclude that she can coordinate and build teams, and her experience at the U of Maryland leads one to assume she can do this in a complex organization.

Job stability

No concerns here … she has been at U Maryland since 1996 and was at U Wisconsin-Milwaukee for nearly 10 years before that.

Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Candidate has many strengths, but also has some weaknesses as noted above.  I would recommend a phone interview to explore the questions raised in this review.</Comment>

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Appears to be appropriate – with multiple first authored and other publications (clinical and research journals). Small grant funding for dissertation. Co-I on R03 (5%) currently (in two year postdoc in health promotion/risk reduction (vulnerable populations) at Michigan. 

B.	Focused program of research
Health risk behaviors; smoking cessation; health promotion. Has public health degree (MPH) in addition to MSN (FNP). 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Experience in teaching community health clinical (always needed here at DUSON in ABSN program); research methods as adjunct at Marymount – small university but typically they have large classes. This is quite a bit of teaching experience as compared to most in the Jr Researcher level applicants.
Combination of MPH and MSN (FNP) could mean that many of DUSON’s teaching needs could fit interests and expertise.
D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Recent practice as NP (last in 2010).

E.	Service to the profession
Reviewer for many relevant professional journals; member of STTI; 
Involvement in service appears appropriate for career stage. 

F.	 Job stability
No issues evident.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Health behaviors; risk reduction – matches with a few DUSON faculty and with others in other disciplines at Duke. MPH could add to important public health/community health needs.

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
I would recommend a phone screen, in light of interests that appear to be a good fit; background in public health and as NP; and teaching experience to a greater extent than most at the Jr Researcher level.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
Definitely schedule a phone interview and pursue actively

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
This candidate has a consistent record of funding from UCSF as well as NIH/NINR and CDC.  She currently is the co-PI on 1 R01, PI on another R01, and has yet another R01 (for which she would be the PI) under review.  Since 2000, she has more than 50 data-based publications in prestigious journals; most of her publications have been done in collaboration with colleagues, and she is first author on 10 of them.  Additionally, she is 3rd author (with Patricia Benner and Chris Tanner) on a book on Expertise in Nursing Practice: Caring, Clinical Judgment and Ethics, which is in its 2nd edition and has been translated to Swedish and German.  She has a consistent record of invited presentations at international conferences, including the International Congress on Qualitative Inquiry, the International Family Nursing Conference, and the International Nursing Research Congress on Evidence-based Practice.  At the national level, she has presented at the APA conference, State of Science Congress, and Asian American Center on Health Disparities Research conference, among others.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
This candidate received her DNSc in 1998 and completed a post-doc at UCSF in the following year.  Since then, she has had a sustained and impressive program of research that shifted over the years “from interpretive studies of family skills and practices, to multidisciplinary multi-method investigations of family factors influencing outcomes in type 2 diabetes, to current work in conducting a clinical trial.”  The central aim of her research is to interpret individual and family experiences with chronic illness so naturalistic interventions can be developed.  Her research, as she notes, has always been community based but has become increasingly community-engaged.  

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
This is an experiences teacher, whose primary focus in recent years is with doctoral students.  Most recently she is teaching Qualitative Research Methods and Interpretive Phenomenology, both of which align with the approaches she uses in her own research.  She seems to take her responsibility as a senior faculty member very seriously in terms of mentoring doctoral students and faculty colleagues, and she received the Excellence in Teaching Award for Research Mentoring from UCSF SON in 2011.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Her “practice” is her research.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
This candidate is actively involved in professional associations that “match” her scholarly work; among her contributions are service as chair of the strategic planning group and member of the Board of the International Family Nursing Association, and service on the Fellows Selection Committee of the AAN.  She has a long history of service as a manuscript reviewer (currently doing this for 3 journals that are aligned with her areas of scholarship), as well as a member of the Editorial Board of another journal, and a consulting editor for yet another.  The candidate has been a consultant to various schools of nursing (including DUSON) and is a visiting faculty at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.  She is a good “citizen of the academy” at the system, campus, school and department levels, serving on (among others) departmental peer review committees and the UCSF Committee on Academic Freedom.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No concerns here … She has been at UCSF since 1988.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
She was inducted into the AAN in 2003 and awarded an endowed chair  in ethics and spirituality in 2008.  This is an experienced researcher, teacher, and professional leader who would be an asset to DUSON in many ways.  She expresses an interest in “connecting” with OGACHI and DTNI, both of which offer exciting opportunities for her and for us.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION: I recommend a campus visit

What are your goals for a faculty position? 
I am in interested in pursuing a nursing research career which will include teaching,  and looking for something that has devoted research time but provide an environment where I could interact with students who are going to be working in practice.
Why duke??
Duke is respected for research and a center for nursing development which is also on the forefront of teaching. I am also looking for a place that has some individuals who can mentor me as I grow as a researcher and teacher.
Because of the reputation of Duke and the fact that Duke is cultivating a research environment is important to me. Also the goals towards grantsmanship at Duke. My PhD is not nursing but interdisciplinary so the Duke interdisciplinary link is intriguing. It was not implied but talked explicated in the mission.
I also met a scholar from the psychology department at Duke who spoke highly of the school of nursing.
Can you explain what an Interdisciplinary PhD is??
In this program you have to have to make a case for why your research questions require more than one discipline to answer when you apply. It is very focused on interdisciplinary approaches to answering research questions.  The committee is interdisciplinary (mine was a psychologist and 2 nurses and a MD). It is to get a perspective on the value of all disciplines
It has strong informal and formal approach to scientific inquiry using qualitative and quantitative methods. I was required to look at mixed methods in as my comprehensive project doing a pilot and a literature synthesis. The PhD has broadened my horizons which allowed me to look at the value of other discipline.
What are your strengths? 
I am very inquisitive and very passionate about nursing. I am tenacious when it comes to work ethic. I have an appreciation for both qualitative and quantitative methods which gives me the ability to bridge these things together. I am very well rounded clinically and I have always had a clinical role.  I think questions which intrigue me the most are practice driven. 
I moved overseas to work as a nurse and do research in under developed countries, so I have experience in global health perspectives

What are your weaknesses? 
I would have to say in the role as a formal educator. I have done some clinical teaching which has gone very well. My personality meshes will with students but course development and learning methods and leading a course I will need help with. I will be teaching research methods for the University in the spring of 2012 and this will give me my first lived experience in formal education.
What is your most significant accomplishment? 
The research I undertook in my dissertation. Acknowledging how pain affects the lives of children and being at the forefront on how pain is affecting social functioning on the lives of my patients.
 Raising awareness of the importance of social interactions on pain and pain management.  Legitimizing the merit of social interaction and the pain experience.
What is your teaching passion? 
My passion is working with student’s face-to-face interaction and the personal connections. It is also finding the best way for a learner to get the information. I can’t say I have one realm that excites me more.
What are your practice interests? 
I have had a varied career from adults in cardiac service to neonates to children and adolescents 
I currently work in acute pain management and am CNS on chronic pain service. Teens living with chronic pain the chronic pain and chronic illness in general.
Future research
I feel my research is at the beginning of looking at the impact of friendship relationship on pain.
I am working on research ideas and submitting grants in my post-doc work related to this phenomena
Want to delve deeper into qualitative methods and do some observational studies and explore interactions. 
I also want to look at various types of interactions and their impact on pain. 
We need to see if these things can improve the pain experience for these individuals. Anything which help them with the pain experience I can do.
I also want to see what pieces we need to add to measurement to help relieve pain in these teens. 


What contributions would you make to DUSON? 

I can continue to develop a program a research that is new yet well within nursing’s scope of  practice.
I can bring my connections within groups looking at pain and the world leaders in pain.
I have contact in Jordan, Thailand and Brazil so I think I could bring those connections and the continued collaborations with the group I have here in Canada.
I know you have suspended you CNS stream but I think that is an added benefit. 
Being able to connect with other faculty at the University, Dr. Ken Dodge at Duke who is in the psychology department. I used his theory on children with aggressive behavior issues and adapted his views on friend behaviors and adapted it for my research.
I have done lots of works to help establish resources and center which specialize in pain management in children globally (Child Kind is a group of clinicians and researchers will try help establish certifications for centers of excellence in pain management of children). The goals of these organizations are to help establish centers and resources like we have for cancer and arthritis pain.


She had questions about appointment and asked for clarification in difference in btw research and tenure track
I would like to be in place in my new role by the summer/fall of 2012.
Deal Breaker-Husband being obstructed from work with relocation.</Comment>

<Comment>From Janet Levy:  Krista Ranby has applied for the junior researcher position. She also has some statistical skills. You might take a look at this and consider her statistical skills when evaluating her for the junior researcher position. See her comments below to me. 

From: Krista Ranby [mailto:krista.ranby@duke.edu] 
Sent: Friday, October 07, 2011 4:12 PM
To: Janet Levy
Subject: Thanks

Janet,

It was nice to meet you yesterday and I wanted to thank you for taking the time to tell me about the School of Nursing and discussing in particular, your experience as a statistician in the School. I appreciate your encouragement for me to apply for the statistician advertisement. As I mentioned, I have applied to the Junior Researcher position. I was contacted today by Chip Bailey about my application; he and I plan to talk next week about that position. I have attached my CV to this email and you are welcome to share it among the statistician search committee if you would like. I think that overall, the description of the Junior Researcher is a better fit for my career aspirations, however, some hybrid of the two positions might actually be the best fit.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone Screen - Dr. Kelly admits, and I agree that she is not strong in a phone interview. I believe her teaching evaluations at Duke are strong and if what we want is a teacher, she fits the bill. 

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? Not really able to answer as she is in the “in between stage.” At Duke she wants to continue to develop on-line courses that engage online audiences. Would like to continue to teach leadership courses, non-clinical courses, health care systems, population, and quality improvement.  Says she was caught by surprise with this question. LT – Focused on master and DNP education. Wants to help nurses understand and be aware of those things that are outside of nursing that prevent nurses from being at the table. Create an awareness to help them function in the bigger world, enhancing professional nursing practice. ST – continue to improve my teaching. She is really an idea person. Interested in a clinical appointment. 

B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Currently teaching online for several universities. In a sabbatical from full-time faculty. I had fulfilled what I could do at Utah. Wants to focus on education with her hand in the practice environment. 

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Teaching as a consulting faculty since 2004. Very impressed with the program. 

D.	What are your strengths? Is a systems thinker and is able to translate the big picture for practitioners. Bridging the practice and academic world.

E.	What are your weaknesses? I get too passionate about what I am doing. I have to step back and try not to push too hard.

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment? My daughter. My book the 3rd edition was released this summer.  Writing and finishing the book has been the hardest accomplishment of her career. She is proud of all the work she done.

G.	What is your teaching passion? As described above
•	Class size 6 (PhD seminar) 65 undergrad class and anywhere in between
•	Clinical groups - NA
•	Online –blended distance, totally on-line, executive format, - comfortable with any of these.

H.	What are your research interests? Quality performance improvement. Applied in the practice setting. How do we improve taking care of patients? How does org structure and leadership contribute to the org culture and allow clinicians to provide best care? Program of research plans? None

I.	What are your practice interests? Leadership coaching, performance improvement, organizations

J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.</Comment>

<Comment> Faculty Telephone Screening Interviews

Name:  YunKyung Chang:  Currently a PDF at UNC-CH School of Nursing and doing a MPH in Department of Biostatistics.

Position:  Junior Researcher

Recommendation:  This applicant&apos;s CV shows evidence of a great amount of self-motivation and skill development.  She is ahead of her peers in terms of publishing and experience with a wide range of methodologies and data types.  On her phone interview she struck me as being very cautious in terms of protection of her time.  She had not investigated anything about our research expertise. She said she was interested in Duke because she lived in Cary and her husband had a good job in this area.  She made comments about work/life balance and asked questions about teaching load and protected time.   If it were not for her number of peer reviewed data based publications I would vote immediately for regret letter.


A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term goals: wants a tenure track position. Will apply for a mentored K award in the first year of appointment. Or a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Fellowship.   This funding will give 2-3 years of secured time.  After that apply for a small R grant or foundation grant.

<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Completed PhD in Quant Psychology in April 2011. Has been a research assistant on multiple studies while at Arizona State and UCSD. Her publications (1 first authored peer reviewed manuscript; multiple others on research teams, appears appropriate for area of interest and career stage. She also lists 3 other first author publications as ‘in preparation’, presumably related to her dissertation work. 

B.	Focused program of research
She states that her focus has been on methods for categorical and limited dependent variables, particularly in the Generalized Linear Model. This work has involved longitudinal data and social/behavioral sciences areas of research. 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Limited experience in teaching; however this fits with her career stage. Has taught one course in undergraduate statistics as an adjunct instructor. Has served as a teaching assistant for 5 courses over the last 10 years. 

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A


E.	Service to the profession
Member and abstract reviewer for the Society for Prevention Research
Research Grant Reviewer for ASU graduate and professional student association

F.	 Job stability
Appropriate at this career stage  --- just completed PhD in the Spring.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Areas of statistical expertise and focus may be a match related to some research currently occurring at DUSON. It would require a more thoughtful discussion to determine exact fit with research/teaching needs here at DUSON. I would therefore recommend pursuing a phone screen to determine ‘why a nursing school?’; why Duke; what the fit of her expertise truly is with the needs of the school.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
I do not see this as a strong candidate for the health policy position, though I would not object to a phone interview.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Candidate has a small grant from ORA &amp; is PI on a K-99 award.  She has 3 publications in refereed journals and 4 manuscripts in preparation; all are joint authorship &amp; she is first author on 1 published and 4 of those in preparation.  This seems appropriate for her career stage.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
I am not clear what her focus of research is from a review of her CV.  Her publications focus on domestic violence in Hispanics, smoking among college women, RN retention strategies, and scope of practice.  Her post-doc work is clearly focused, but that is to be expected.  Her letter describes the policy implications of her post-doc work, but the policy piece seems to me to be an “after thought,” not a passionate life’s work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Her letter says she has 7 years’ teaching experience and that it’s both didactic and clinical, yet her position at USC for 7 years has been as a CI.  If the CI role there includes didactic teaching, course responsibility, and responsibility in the full scope of the faculty role, that would be most unusual.  She is currently working with Dr. Corazzini to teach a DUSON course in applied stats.  I see no teaching at all related to health policy.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
She has experience as a perinatal educator (7 years), RN, (1 year), and Psych NP, but the latter is only for 1 year.  Not sure what her clinical history in Psych has been, but I assume it was the focus of her MSN program since she currently is certified.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Manuscript reviewer for 2 journals (1 in health care management &amp; 1 in gerontology) &amp; served on the legislative committee of the SCNA for 1 year.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Most recent position at USC was for 7 years.  Prior to that, however, her job “stints” were rather short.  She documents no positions that relate to health policy work.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Candidate’s letter leads one to believe she is quite accomplished and somewhat expert in health policy, but I do not see it.  Yes, her PhD is in public health/health services policy/management, but the only policy experience or work I see is the 1 year on the SCNA legislative committee.  Personal testimony before state legislative committees is nice, but does not speak to expertise in health policy, in my opinion.  Her letter notes that she has experience in “political advocacy,” but I see no evidence of that in her CV.

AREAS TO FOLLOW UP ON …
I would want to know more about her health policy work, her teaching experiences, and her job history.</Comment>

<Comment>
RECOMMENDATION  …  
Although this candidate’s PhD and MSc are in Statistics, I do not see him as a particularly strong candidate and would recommend we send a regret letter.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
CV does not document any funding for research.  Publications are sporadic – 1 in 2005, 1 in 2006 (the year he earned his PhD), 2 in 2007, none in 2008, 2 in 2009, and none in 2010 or 2011.  Notes 4 manuscripts “in preparation” but none “under review” or “in press.”  Presentations are primarily at local programs.  I must admit to not knowing what “contributed talks” are, though most of those seem to be at local programs as well.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Research “interests” are in statistical analysis of genomic &amp; proteomic data, multivariate analysis, logistic regression, mixed models, &amp; applied probability.  I must admit that his “research statement” was largely Greek to me, but it did sound like there was a goal and focus to his research “agenda.”

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Taught Math in Beijing for 5 years, but documents no other teaching experience.  He has served as a research associate and postdoc fellow, but documents no teaching responsibilities or experiences in those roles.  His teaching statement suggests he tried to be a “friend” to students and that he tries very hard to “connect” with students in order to promote their learning.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable … not a nurse

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
He lists “mathematical reviews” for 2.5 years and then lists 5 journals.  It is unclear whether this means he is a manuscript reviewer for those 5 journals???  Other than this, there is no evidence of service to the profession.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Since coming to the US/Canada from China, he was a postdoc research associate at Rochester for 1 year, a postdoc fellow at McGill for 2 years, a research associate at Northwestern for less than 1 year, and has been a postdoc associate at Yale since 2010.  This kind of movement worries me, but it may be all that he could do to develop his networks and skills/expertise.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I suppose he could teach Stats, but I’m not sure he’s the strongest candidate to do that, given the limitations noted above.  Additionally, his writing skills need extensive development.</Comment>

<Comment>I recommend not pursuing this candidate any further. On review of his cover letter and CV, he appears to have been long removed from academia and in a consulting business. His last publications were in 1987; and although no specific dates for his teaching experience are listed, I assume it was many years ago given the list of employment in consulting and various organizations for all recent years. Unless someone sees another reason to proceed with phone screen, I do not see this candidate as a good fit.</Comment>

<Comment>Interview Guide for Faculty Telephone Screening Interviews
Coxe - Statistician
Recommendation: I wasn’t able to get a good sense of her overall interest in this position or her overall fit. Her experience working with faculty in psychology is in behavioral research/prevention which seems to translate well into the work here at DUSON. However when I tried to probe as to ‘why a nursing school?’ I didn’t get a straightforward response. She could fit well given her background. I think this would need to be determined as she met with or at least talked to the statisticians and other faculty so I’d recommend pursuing a campus visit if she’s otherwise competitive with current candidates in the pool. 
A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term: 
Methodology- behavioral 
Collaboration – improving other’s methods for research
Pursuing her own line of research in categorical outcomes – simulations of methods 

Long term: 
Same as above


B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)?
N/A – completed doctoral work

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Has always been in psychology; but spent time in educational psychology at ASU and at Prevention Research center – interdisciplinary group in psychology; also in bio/engineering. Areas of interest outside of psychology as she thought about various possibly positions.


D.	What are your strengths?
Computer simulations 
Very detail oriented
Logic of programming is something she enjoys

E.	What are your weaknesses?
Work involves many facets – grad student and research collaborations; can be overwhelming
Making sure not overwhelmed


F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Defended dissertation with both advisors out of the country on sabbatical and multiple issues in scheduling with committee. Completing dissertation successfully. 


G.	What is your teaching passion?
•	Class size
•	Clinical groups
•	Online
No particular passion but enjoys how students come to see how everything fits together and progress throughout the course; sees the big picture



H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Categorical outcomes ; methodological questions – inspired by collaborating and helping others 
(above under goals)


I.	What are your practice interests?
N/A




J.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
I tried to probe to ask about why she would want to come to a nursing school specifically. She didn’t really answer other than to say she started exploring areas outside psychology.</Comment>

<Comment>PHONE SCREEN  …  11.07.11


What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
I expect to have another 10 years or so in my career, so to some extent, my short-and long-term goals are the same.  Short term, of course, would be to learn a new environment and how I can contribute to it.  I expect to continue my scholarship and “push the margins” of what nursing scholarship can add to the body of knowledge that gets translated to communities.  I think the potential for that is “wide open and intriguing,” and I would look forward to working in an interdisciplinary fashion to pursue this work.

Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
On a personal basis, my children are grown, and I am able to make a move.  I think I’ve reached a point where I’m curious to be in another setting/environment (particularly on a “full service” campus) where scholars from various disciplines (e.g., Philosophy) can come together to do research and innovative projects.  UCSF is strictly health-oriented, so the possibility of working with colleagues from non-health areas is intriguing.

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
I think UCSF has a great PhD program and talented PhD students, but when I came to Duke to consult on your PhD program, I felt an excitement and commitment among the faculty that energized me and made me think about new possibilities.  Also – to be honest – I think it would be wonderful to be in an environment where resources are abundant.

What are your strengths?
I have a proclivity for social justice, and that drives me.  My work on the disparities study section of NIH helps me stay on the forefront of work in this area.  I am an experienced teacher (at the MSN and PhD levels) and am comfortable with curriculum development.  I also enjoy and am successful at mentoring junior faculty in their teaching and research careers … and I like to do that!  I am a good member of the community.  I bring expertise in family health (particularly in the face of chronic illness) and am a long-standing interpretive scientist.

What are your weaknesses?
If I were asked to teach quantitative methods, I would have to say “No thanks.”

What is your most significant accomplishment?
I think my ability to articulate cultural differences in health care has helped many clinicians, teachers and researchers see and appreciate things that could influence their work … things they may not even have been aware of.

What is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online
I enjoy teaching interpretive methods and am best as a process-oriented teacher with small groups.  However, I have taught classes of 100+ in family theory (though that was a while ago), and I often teach courses for PhD or FNP students where there are 30 students in the class … and I’m OK with this.  I’ve taught health disparities and family health and regularly teach in the FNP program.  I am comfortable with using online material to support a course, but I do not think I would like teaching totally online.

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
I look forward to extending my research with Asian-American populations.  I understand that Durham does not have a large Asian-American population, so continuing this work may be a bit of a challenge, but that is where I’d like to see my work continuing to move.

What are your practice interests?
We did not discuss this

Why duke??
Duke is a world class school of nursing and medical center. The school is growing in research and there seems to be a high priority on infrastructure around interdisciplinary collaboration. The mentorship of current faculty that is taking place and resources that go beyond the school in the medical school and the new cancer center which I am specifically interested in.  My interests line up well with those of Dr. Lipkus and his work on smoking cessation prevention and management of behaviors in chronic diseases.
What are your strengths? 
Strong record of research training and related scholarship.
Persistent and dedicated when it comes to getting things published and getting grants
Obtaining funding for my research 
What are you weaknesses? 
Teaching hasn’t been developed in my post-doc so I will need to improve my skills as educator
2 years at Mary Mount College I taught community clinical and nursing research for 2 semester.  I have also been a TA. I think I have a good foundation for beginnings as an educator.
What is your most significant accomplishment? 
Getting my fellowship for my dissertation from the American Lung Association I think it demonstrated I can captivate audience, show merit of my work and articulate importance of my research. Also getting post doc at Michigan
What is your teaching passion? 
Face to face student interaction and being able to facilitate discussion. Really enjoyed teaching research course.
What are your practice interests? 
FNP community and occupational health. 
Working at community clinics HIV, Susan G Korman Grant preventative services and health promotion services and clinics most recently
Initially as an RN worked mostly in pediatrics.

Future research
I am working to look at understanding of health behaviors and health behavior changes in blue collar population. I am working on understanding tobacco use and intervention based on health beliefs model to promote benefits of behavior change and increase self-efficacy in this population.
I worked on an R21-as Co-investigator for smoking cessation intervention and working on sun screen intervention for blue collar worker. I envision larger scale testing and implementation and adoption in others populations.
I plan on submitting an R03 in February.
What contributions would you make to DUSON? 
I think I have a strong record of research training and scholarship and the drive to continue.  I bring some diversity to the DUSON research portfolio. 
I have been strong at Michigan with interdisciplinary collaboration. I also have relationships at UVA and Michigan. I will bring these connections with me. I am good at using and recognizing resources so my weakness in education will be addressed</Comment>

<Comment>Recommendation: regret letter due to lack of fit and would likely not meet tenure requirements at Duke. 

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No – PhD in 1993. Funding primarily relatively small grants (although may be large using Jordanian conversion) in Jordan conducting public health focused research there. Most recently submitted an RO1 to NIH/NIDA for work in Jordan as well. Was PI on one study that was funded under a center grant (P20). 


B.	Focused program of research
Smoking and other public health issues in Jordan. Perceptions of nursing in Jordan.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Not clear – she would be a potential fit in community/public health but this is not completely clear based on cover letter and CV. 


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Appears to be licensed RN in VA but not practicing currently.


E.	Service to the profession
Reviewer for many journals; service on many committees at VCU including involvement with accreditation. 


F.	 Job stability
She has been at VCU since 2007 as Associate Professor with Tenure. 


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I am not sure of her potential contribution and match given that we don’t currently have a large public health focus (although there has been discussion about increasing this). Also, her scholarship in terms of grant funding is mostly in Jordan which would not necessarily lend itself to her meeting our tenure track and mentoring needs and requirements at this time. Having said that, her involvement in Jordan could potentially expand DUSON’s presence via OGACHI and there has been initial conversation at the university level (academic council) about possible presence in the Middle East. 
She has held many administrative positions in Jordan including Dean of a School of Nursing. 



H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
I had some concern in reading her cover letter that her grammar/writing was not proper consistently and I would expect that at a faculty level even in cases of those who work in other countries and speak other languages besides English.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  Do not pursue … Not particularly strong as a teacher or scholar

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  Master’s since 1984, DNP since 2009 … Lists her DNP project as research and notes current role as PI on a study at her place of employment.  The current study is congruent with her DNP focus.  Additionally, this focus is reflected in her more recent presentations, most of which have been local or regional, and in her 2 recent publications.  Those 2 publications are in peer-reviewed journals … Nursing Economic$ and Journal of Nursing Scholarship.  

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  I’m not sure I would call it a “program of research,” but it’s clear that her current focus is on critical thinking of nurse managers.  Her letter indicates a commitment to pursuing an agenda of nursing research, presumably in this area.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  Candidate has taught CE courses and is an Adjunct Professor at Adelphi since 2010, where she says (in her letter) she teaches BSN students in clinical, Fundamentals theory, and a seminar on critical thinking.  Indicates a passion for teaching students, but experience is very limited.  Her master’s focus at NYU was in nursing education, but she did not pursue a teaching position post-graduation; instead, she stayed in clinical and administrative roles.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE  …  She is employed in the clinical arena, but her most recent positions have been administrative (e.g., assistant administrator, director of a clinical area, and assistant director of nursing).  Additionally, her responsibilities have been in peds/OB, critical care, and ambulatory care.  I’m not sure I see current strength in “Adult.”

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  Has been active on committees where she works, but her only involvement in professional associations was as the treasurer of a local STTI chapter in 1992-1995.

JOB STABILITY  …  Was at The New York Hospital for 9 years, then NYU Medical Center for 3 years, and at Long Island Jewish Medical Center since 1998 (13+ years).  No concerns in terms of job stability.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  I do not see this candidate as particularly strong in clinical or adult health, which is the position for which she is applying.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  Conduct a phone screen, as candidate seems very well qualified

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  Candidate has received funding as a PI or Co-PI from NSF, NCI, and the Templeton Foundation (among others).  He is completing an R-01 from the NCI, though it’s not clear whether he is a co-PI, consultant or supervisor on the project.  He is highly productive with publications and has a strong, consistent record; publications are in respected journals; he has published with Isaac Lipkus and Sharron Docherty; and he has 5 manuscripts in press.  Most publications are co-authored, and he has been first author on 8 in the past 5 years.  He also has presented consistently as national conferences.  All presentations and publications are clearly aligned with his program of research.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  The CV documents evidence of the research focus outlined in his letter – how people think about, prepare for, and respond to bad news.  Included in this are 3 foci:  how people distort and dismiss unwanted and threatening information, people’s tendency to shelve their optimism when they anticipate a challenge to their optimistic outlook, and beliefs that one is likely to experience negative outcomes than are others.  This focus is clear and consistent over time.  Interestingly, his letter notes that he has applied for and received grant funding while teaching 2 courses/semester, holding administrative responsibilities, and serving as associate editor for one of the top journals in his field.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  Candidate has been teaching since 1988 and been at U of Florida since 1992, where he progressed from Assistant Professor to Professor of Psychology.  During this time he has also been a Visiting Professor in France and a Visiting Scientist with the NCI.  He has been involved in the work of the university and advised master’s theses and doctoral dissertation.  His letter outlines his teaching philosophy, which emphasizes encouraging/”pushing”/helping students develop as skeptical, critical thinkers.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE  …  Not applicable

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  Actively involved professional … journal editor, committee member in professional associations, etc.

JOB STABILITY  …  No concerns … at U of Florida since 1992.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  The focus of his research is highly relevant to nursing issues, so he could be a valuable member of various research teams … as well as including nursing faculty and clinicians on his research teams.  In addition, he could teach in clinical or other courses when decision-making in challenging situations is addressed.</Comment>

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  Consistent external funding, primarily from AHRQ, companies, and Duke.  Has served as PI, co-PI, collaborator, and research coordinator.  Consistent track record of publications is impressive; 1st author on several; 4 manuscripts in press, along with 1 book chapter; 1st author on 5 of 7 book chapters published or in press.  Focus of research and publications congruent with research interest.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  Describes his research focus as care of neurologically injured patients during the acute phase of their illness; particularly interested in looking at nursing as a variable in the care of these patients.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  Assistant Prof in Duke’s Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology since 2007 and Assistant Research Professor at DUSON since 2009.  Taught “Intro to Nursing Research” for 1 semester at UNC, and has taught “Research Utilization” for 5 semesters at DUSON.  Also has been a guest lecturer – mostly on nursing research topics – at both schools.  Has mentored MDs in neurocritical care fellowships and mentored nursing students in research.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE  …  Level 4 staff nurse in Neuro ICU at DUHS since 1996.  Remained at bedside even after completing PhD.  Certified in critical care.  Clinical knowledge and practice is current and cutting-edge.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  Very involved in committees and initiatives at work and in professional associations (on committees and as a reviewer).  A most active and involved professional.

JOB STABILITY  …  As noted above, has been in Neuro ICU at Duke for 15+ years .. No concerns about job stability.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  This is a well-qualified candidate who could easily teach Adult Health in the ABSN program, as well as research courses.  He also could mentor students in their clinical research projects.</Comment>

<Comment>PHONE SCREEN  …  December 8, 2011

Recommendation
Campus visit … explore his interest in and commitment to teaching ABSN students

What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
My short-term goal is to secure a faculty position where I will have better mentoring related to my research and NIH funding.  My long-term goal is to better understand the contributions nurses can make at the bedside in caring for neuro patients … and how to study that.  NOTE:  I asked if his primary interest/goals related to the development of his program of research, and he said “yes “.

Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Not applicable other than to say that with a change in leadership and heightened expectations in the Division of Neurology (which, apparently, is soon to be named a Department), he does not think he will be able to successfully compete to  advance in (and maybe even retain) that position.

Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
I know the program and the school and would not be coming in to the system “blind.”  I have key clinical connections that can be used to help create unique learning experiences for students with an interest in caring for neuro patients.  I see ABSN students all the time on my clinical unit and see them as future nurse colleagues … I want to help set them on a good professional direction.

What are your strengths?
My clinical passion/expertise and my understanding of the reality of clinical practice.  I am really committed to nursing and care about being a nurse.  I have great connections, nationally and internationally, with the neuro nursing and medical community.

What are your weaknesses?
My passion for what I know and believe can sometimes “rub people the wrong way” and come across as “politically incorrect,” but once we talk more, they tend to understand.  I have not been successful with NIH funding, though I have had funding from other sources.

What is your most significant accomplishment?
My dissertation and getting that published … I also think that the “summary” of manuscripts I’ve published have allowed me to advance in the neuro community, become involved and respected in the Neuro Critical Care Society (which is physician dominated, and let people know what I have to offer.

What is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online
I enjoy close connections with students.  In the ideal world, I would like to teach small classes in a face-to-face format so that I can know whether or not students are really “getting it,” but I have taught large courses and I have taught online … and I’ve been successful with both of those things.

What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
I am interested in working with brain-injured patients (of any kind) and studying how we, as nurses, contribute to their outcomes.  Nursing care really does matter and it makes a big difference in the care of these patients, but we have no evidence to support that.  I want to help develop that evidence.

What are your practice interests?
Adult neuroscience (neuro critical care, neurosurgery) …  I want to stay at the bedside as a staff nurse, no matter what position I’m in or where I end up.

Issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Not applicable … the Search Committee did not identify any issues/concerns

NOTE:  This candidate’s passion about clinical practice is most obvious.  He also is very interested in doing research.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION
Do not pursue … Inexperienced with no outstanding accomplishments noted in resume or explained in letter

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Candidate expects to complete PhD in May 2012.  He does not describe his dissertation research, and he indicates no research involvement in his resume or letter.  No publications or presentations are documented.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
None is evident

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Candidate has taught Intro to Stats to non-majors for 5 semesters and has been a TA in 3 graduate-level (I assume) Stats courses.  Letter speaks to valuing student-centered classrooms and says he enjoys teaching, but he offers no examples of innovative approaches to teaching or what his evaluations are like.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Not applicable

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
None documented, though he is very early in his career

JOB STABILITY  …  
I assume that all but the 2006-07 position have been at NCSU while he was a student, though it’s hard to tell.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
He does indicate that he currently provides statistical consultation to graduate students and has helped researchers “in the design of their experiments, the analysis of data, and in the professional write-up of results,” all of which are relevant experiences for our position.  However, he does not seem to bring extensive experience with this kind of work and is not likely to be able to make the kind of contributions we need here at DUSON.</Comment>

<DateOfComment>2012-01-05T00:00:00</DateOfComment>
<Comment>A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
21 peer reviewed publications (12 first authored); internal and external funding (co-I on current R01; current Center for Personalized Med internal funding; R21 under review). Has been at Assistant Professor rank since 2005 (U of Kentucky then Duke School of Medicine). Faculty BIRCWH scholar when at U of Kentucky.  


B.	Focused program of research
Health policy particularly women’s health issues. Mental health and chronic illness /obesity and postpartum depression.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has both undergraduate and graduate / mentoring experience in teaching; however it isn’t clear to me what class size she has taught and how she would adapt to online teaching in a large cohort of DNP students. She mentions other courses (in addition to those we offer at DUSON) that she could potentially add and teach which is helpful and insightful. This may add to health policy education at DUSON if we are looking to expand that area. 


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A – she is not a nurse; background in counseling and family therapy. 


E.	Service to the profession
Member and has served in specific officer roles in national professional organizations. University committees/leadership. 


F.	 Job stability
No apparent issues. Has been at Duke (Integrative medicine) since 2009.            
Is open about her reasons for wanting to change positions; she wants to be more involved in teaching. 

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Health policy expertise with teaching experience could fit well with DUSON needs for this particular position if she is open to online teaching and fairly large class size.
Her research in chronic disease/mental health/women’s health could be  a good compliment to current DUSON research interests.

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
I don’t feel strongly that she is the perfect match for this position so I think we need to go back and compare her to other applicants. The following are areas of potential mismatch/questions: She is not a nurse; does she know what the DNP is/what this class needs to focus on?; larger class size?; online teaching? However, I would suggest a phone screen to further explore her teaching background and how it may or may not fit the exact needs of this DNP teaching position. That would allow us to compare her to other candidates with more complete information.</Comment>

RECOMMENDATION: Campus visit

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Long-term: move up in academic ranks- build and sustain program of research- ; pull more policy into work; heading public policy task force at Center for Personalized Med currently
Active role in instruction; to inform research and mentor students
School of nursing – focus on maternal child health – sees herself contributing to this work from a policy perspective
Applications of personalized medicine
Expand role of nursing in policy – mom is a nurse and seeing her career evolve and health care reform – role of nursing practice – all levels – bring back link of holistic view of person to health care – policy is segmented rather than at person level (Medicaid; food stamps; employment – all separate) – nurses as experts in looking at ‘big picture’ or whole person in context of whole life can greatly influence policy making
B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Linking teaching, research, service 
Right now is not a focus on teaching in her position – wants it to be valued as part of what she does 
C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
N/A – already at Duke in IM/SOM
D.	What are your strengths?
-	 Academic and practical experience for this role
-	Proponent of hands on experience – teaches content as one part of it – knowledge and then need application
-	Passion for working with low income underserved populations- looks at how things will work in translation from research to these populations


E.	What are your weaknesses?
-	Focus – so many interesting projects and opportunities at Duke that it’s more difficult to keep focused and ‘say no’
-	Mentor – ralph snyderman – has been supportive in this
F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
-	Reason for career choice was to make a difference so most proud of 2 accomplishments:
-		Blue to you – program at Univ of Kentucky – depression program to address high needs there ; survey of women about resources and depression; data used to develop comprehensive education program for county extension agents (community based educators) – 5 modules on depression throughout lifespan- now in all different venues – has had large impact (in every KY county)
-	2 colleagues in maternal/fetal med and behavioral med – developed program with March of Dimes grant to address maternal use of oxycontin in rural communities in KY – now used for all substance use – based on centering model – with Frontier School of Midwifery

G.	What is your teaching passion?
-	When students have ‘aha’ moments
-	Seminars with small groups for discussion; or groups that are manageable enough to divide for small group work 
-	No courses strictly online but has used learning management systems  in past like Blackboard– would be ok with teaching online
-	Has used online discussion/social media to augment  courses


H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
-	CPM grant – pilot data for 1. Use in pregnancy rather than postpartum then follow them an include children ; 2. Apply model in low income setting
-	Continue to explore how personalized med approaches apply in low income; underserved populations; how to help patients manage decision making in limited resource environment and incorporate in policy work
-	Explore and influence how health care reform will be implemented (particularly at state level as the expenses and resources will likely devolve to the state level)

I.	What are your practice interests?
-	Involved in small amount of health coaching – but not part of current academic role.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone conversation--screening on 1/6/12.

Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above
•	Program or research in Patient Safety and quality in in-patient settings.  Current program of research is to understand the determinants of falls, and to develop and test interventions to prevent falls and fall injuries of adults in hospital settings. 
•	92 peer-reviewed publications spanning from 1999-present.
•	Currently has an R41 Small Business Technology Transfer grant—subcontract PI.
•	AHRQ R03 just ended in fall 2011.
•	Has had a series of small (&lt;25K) grants in US and Taiwan 

B.	Progressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.
•	Currently is the Assoc. Director of Nursing and Undergraduate Programs, Department of Nursing (since 2010). Traditional, accelerated 2nd career BSN and BSN-RN completion programs) for about 700 undergraduate nursing students.
•	Experience administering online programs.
•	Brief experience as Acting Co-Director of Nursing, Department of Nursing (April-May 2011) overseeing all operations of the Department.
•	Served as a Department Chair for one year at I-Shou University, Department of Nursing, Kaohsiung, Taiwan
•	Served as a Department Chair for one year at Tajen University of Technology (previous name: Tajen Institute of Technology), Nursing Department, Pingtung, Taiwan

C.	Experience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)

1. Research
•	See above for specifics.  She has a weaker record of funding that is expected at Duke but her publication productivity is outstanding, particularly given she is not as a research intensive school.

2. Teaching
•	Has been teaching leadership/management and research courses since 1999.

3. Professional Service
•	Significant level of editorial advisory roles and peer-review for journals.  
•	No national leadership roles in societies but is a member of a couple of professional associations.
•	This is an area of weakness.  Most likely could make Associate but tenure would be a stretch.

D.	Potential to be a thought leader
She gave reflective answer to questions but in this phone conference, I was not able to fully assess the item.

E.	Potential as a coordinator  and team builder in complex organizations
•	Dr. Tzeng discussed several aspects of what it took to build a top school of nursing.  Seemed to understand what it takes.  She expressed a strong emphasis on mentoring which fits with DUSON.

F.	 Job stability
•	That are a few positions that were held for short time and a couple that were held for an acceptable length.

G.	Summary of potential contribution/match to DUSON

<Comment>
Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
He is early in his research career (completed PhD 3/11) but I do not see evidence of moving scholarship forward (possibly related to current clinical role without research time/resources). It does not appear that he has demonstrated dissemination of scholarship base on VERY limited publications. 
Listed as ongoing participation on research team is: 
Co-Investigator on-going Research
    Study #10-2076 The Relationship between Body Mass Index and Time Attributed to Rendering Anesthesia in a Defined Surgical Population.
I’m not sure where funding is coming from or how long this study is running. 

B.	Focused program of research
His focus is not entirely clear although he expresses a desire in cover letter to pursue his research further in a role/institution that would support that. His dissertation focused on difficult intubations. 


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
I don’t see any direct teaching experience. Mentions mentoring one DNP student on his CV.  He does mention teaching experience in his cover letter but I’m not sure what it is specifically- only experience listed on CV is Airway Management Course faculty (national program) and I’m not sure if we’d consider that relevant enough to this position.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Practicing CRNA for 10 years; including administrative role as chief of nursing anesthesia at UNC for 3 years. Relevant to role of NAP AD.


E.	Service to the profession
Journal reviewer for AANA.


F.	 Job stability
At UNC for 10 years indicating good stability.


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Clinically fits the position but not sure that his administrative experience is completely relevant (clinical vs. in educational setting) and his research is in early stages – would it be too much to take on this administrative position and start research career, especially if he doesn’t have formal teaching experience? 



H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

Limited scholarly activity (may be function of his current role but not sure)
Limited teaching experience (for national program but not in academia)
Excellent clinical background including as chief of nurse anesthesia (admin experience)

Recommend: phone screen to assess scholarly work, teaching experience and any other areas of concern.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
Do not pursue

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
No funding, no publications … Will present her dissertation (as a poster) at a regional conference in 2012 … 2 other presentations were in 2005, and both were at her place of employment

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Letter indicates an interest in developing “a program of study focused on understanding lifestyle behaviors of African Americans with and at risk for hypertension and conducting interventions to improve their health outcomes.” … This seems to build on her dissertation, but there is no indication of a clear plan to pursue this program of study

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has taught for 6 years as a Clinical Assistant Professor … Courses taught include “Integrative Skills” (whatever that is!), Community Health, Clinical Skills, and Gero .. See no evidence of having taught acute care adult health courses (unless that’s what “Integrative Skills” is, which I would doubt) … Letter notes that students regard her as a great teacher, but there are no teaching awards noted

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Clinical practice focuses primarily on adult health in acute care settings .. Many jobs are “short stints” (1-2 years) … I’m not clear what her current position as an “On Assignment Travel Nurse” means … No certifications noted .. I also must admit to being a bit confused by the practice in Adult Health and her applying for that position but the MSN and her teaching being in Community Health

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Lists membership in several organizations, but no indication of active involvement in them

JOB STABILITY  …  
As noted above, many positions (other than the 6 years at the U of Memphis) are very short term, which always raises a “red flag” for me

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I just don’t see that she would make any significant contributions to DUSON, at least not at this stage in her career development</Comment>

RECOMMENDATION  …  
I think this is a fairly weak candidate, but I would support a phone screen for further investigation

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
PhD completed in March 2011, so he is early in his career .. Indicates he is a co-investigator on a research study related to anesthesia, but the date is 2010 (Was this a short-term project in the institution where he worked???), and it’s not clear if this is funded and if so, by whom … Same poster presented at 2 national conferences in 2011 .. Several presentations (national meetings) on difficult airway … No publications noted … Did receive Doctoral Fellowship from the AANA Foundation for 2 years to support her dissertation work

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Letter indicates a desire “for professional expansion through doctoral level scholarship,” but just what that means is not clear, nor is there any indication of a focus for ongoing scholarly work 

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
No teaching experience other than CE-type courses .. No indication that he has any idea how an academic institution operates or what it means to assist in running an academic program 

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Good clinical experiences as CRNA, and holds appropriate certification

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Membership in several organizations .. Only “service” documented is as a journal reviewer for AANA journal … Serves on an IRB at UNC Hospitals, which is service to that institution

JOB STABILITY  …  
No “red flags” raised for me in this area

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Hard to say … Good practice experience as CRNA and does have 2.5 years’ experience as the Chief of Nursing Anesthesia at UNC Hospitals … But how helpful is that administrative experience in a practice setting to expectations of the AD for our CRNA program? … Also, the cover letter does not say much about her, what she’s passionate about, why she wants to move into academe, how she thinks she can contribute here; additionally, it conveys no real enthusiasm for this position … Phone interview could help clarify all this</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant Review:

Recommendation:  Do not pursue

Current Position: Since 2004 Department of Cardiology at Duke/ 100% research funded.  He has a PhD in Exercise Physiology and an M.Ed. in College Instruction
Is also (since 2004) Auxiliary Faculty at WFU Translational Science Center: Fostering Independence in Aging

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Publications: No for Senior Researcher:  He has 25-28 peer reviewed papers since 2000.  &lt;50% first or senior author.  
Funding:  Difficult to evaluate as he runs a lab that provides analysis for other grants.  He is Co-I on these other grants.  He has 3 R-21s pending. He does not appear to be PI on any current (large) grant.  He has been co-investigator on many grants and has had some small level federal funding and industry funding.  He doesn’t seem to have the grant funding experience that we would consider to be a senior level investigator. 


B.	Focused program of research
Program of research on cardiovascular and exercise physiology and with focus on vascular health
and the atherosclerotic process, specifically peripheral blood flow, endothelial function, and
nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability at rest, and following acute and chronic exercise. He has built an independent research program with both clinical vascular and basic biochemistry laboratories
He has research collaborations with endocrinology, oncology, rheumatology, vascular surgery, biomedical engineering and infectious disease which demonstrate the applicability of his research to a range of disciplines. 

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Is currently not involved in classroom teaching.

Recommendation:  This candidate is at the very begnning of his career as a statistical scientist.  While he shows good promise (see his experience at DCRI) it seems as though he would need a moderate amount of mentoring in teaching and in statistical consulting.  I recommend that we do not pursue.  

Currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University, anticipating dissertation defense in early 2012.  Currently an intern at Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI).  

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
He is just beginning his career as a statistical scientist.  No evidence of research funding nor collaboration on funding applications.  
He has collaborated on some manuscripts.  He has one publication. He has one under review. He has three other manuscripts in preparation stages. 

 

B.	Focused program of research
None noted. He works as a part-time intern for the manuscripts group of Clinical Trials Statistics at DCRI, collaborating with clinicians on a variety of cardiovascular projects.  He has worked on many clinical research projects as a lead biostatistician leading to a peer-reviewed publication with several more in preparation or presented as abstracts at medical conferences.  At DCRI, he consults with clinician-scientists on research topics, working with them to define hypotheses, write analysis plans, carry out analyses, and present findings in peer-reviewed manuscripts.
He has given 6 presentations (2-3 local) at research conferences.

	
C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
He worked for one summer as a mentor to undergraduate students in a Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics. In this position he provided homework and statistical programming assistance. 
He also worked as a fellow for one year in the Center for Interdisciplinary Research, Saint Olaf College. In this position he engaged in collaborative research and assisted in homework assistance. 
It appears that he has not had formal classroom teaching experience.


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Not applicable. 


E.	Service to the profession
No evidence of service in professional organizations. 


F.	 Job stability

No concerns.


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

It appears as though he could teach masters and DNP level statistics and consult on basic statistical analysis plans.  He is at the very beginning of his career.</Comment>

<Comment>Recommendation:  Very early in his career.  Has some very good beginning teaching experiences and would likely be fairly independent with teaching.  But would need a lot of mentoring for research consultation work.   I recommend that we do not pursue unless we are in emergent need for statistical teaching help.  

Currently finishing Ph.D. in statistics at North Carolina State University and expect to graduate in the spring of 2012.  Since August 2010 has worked as a statistical consultant to graduate students in College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No evidence of research funding, or publication.  He is at the very beginning of his career.


B.	Focused program of research
No evidence of a focused program of research. 
Dissertation topic: Methods to Improve Prediction Accuracy using Structural Constraints

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
In his current position, held since August 2010, he is the statistical consultant to graduate students in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.  In this position he aids researchers in the design of their studies, the analysis of data, and in the professional write-up of results. Has worked on response surface designs, randomized complete block designs, split-plots, repeated measures data, regression, multi-way ANOVA, non-linear regression, and power analysis.
Has served as instructor at NCSU for  Introduction to Statistics, for five different semesters. This experience has given him practice at teaching difficult concepts to non-statistically minded. He believes in a student centered classroom that encourages active learning and open dialogue that will lead to a deeper understanding of the concepts and ideas.   Has worked as a TA in 3 different statistics courses at NCSU. 
Is a  fluent SAS programmer. Has used and written macros, imported and cleaned large data sets, and prepared visually appealing results documents.

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A


E.	Service to the profession

N/A

F.	 Job stability

No concerns

<Comment>Candidate:         Lichan Chia                                          			 Position:  health policy
Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Has current postdoctoral funding under T32 at Pitt (AHRQ health policy T32). Also Co-I on R18. 
1 first-authored peer reviewed pub; 1 other author. A few more listed as under review or in preparation. Many conference presentations and proceedings. 
Funding seems appropriate for career stage but no definitive future funding plans noted in CV or letter.

B.	Focused program of research
Research is in area of more health services and health disparities (particularly among older adults) and looking at factors related to chronic disease management (diabetes). 
In her letter she states . I have been gathering preliminary data from these analyses and studies, and I have solid plans for seeking external funding.   – this seems to refer to seeking funding in health disparities and promoting care particularly in older adults with diabetes.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
A few guest lectures noted on CV. Lists herself as adjunct assistant professor on CV from 2007-2008 but no specific courses noted.  
Lists two mentored students for focused research areas (lit review/pub /presentation)

D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Does not discuss – is licensed as RN.

E.	Service to the profession
Reviewer for many respectable publications relevant to her area of study.
Member of many professional organizations – no offices or leadership roles held.

F.	 Job stability
Difficult to assess since she has been in doctoral and postdoctoral programs.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Fit is noted in areas of health disparities particularly with aging/older adults. And we could use more people focused in chronic disease which she is….but difficult to assess her fit for the teaching aspects of this posted position in health policy.

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
If we wish to look at full pool of health policy candidates, I would suggest a phone screen to further assess her fit in terms of her research plans (what are they specifically?) and her fit with the teaching needs of this position. Those are very important aspects of this position that I didn’t get a good enough sense of from her materials.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION
Do not recommend for Health Policy position, though would not argue against a phone interview to explore her evolving expertise in broader health policy work.  Should we decide to move forward with this candidate, we will need to confirm her (?) dissertation defense date … the CV indicates completion of the PhD in August 2012.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
The Masters of Public Health (Epidemiology) was completed in 2005, and she has been in doctoral study since 2008.  The CV documents “research participation prior to USA residency” – she was a researcher on 6 studies in Korea, all related to infection control.  It is not clear what her role as a “researcher” was.  She has 2 publications in press (as 1st author), 1 from 2008 (author #10 of 11), 2 in 2004 (author #1 on both), and 1 in 2003 (#2 of 6).  She also has 2 book chapters in 2012, 1 in 2007, and 4 in 2006.  All publications focus on infection control.  She has presented her infection control work at national/international conferences in 2011, 2010, 2005, and 2004.  None of these publications or presentations have to do with health policy, though her letter indicates that she is has a manuscript draft that is a “policy analysis of hospitals’ isolation precautions for visitors.”  

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
It is clear that this candidate’s area of focus for many years has been infection control.  Neither her letter or CV outlines future research activities, but given her long history, it seems safe to assume that she will continue this line of scholarly work.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
CV documents 2-year appointment at UNC as a “Teaching Assistant &amp; Student Recruiter.”  The description of this position says nothing about teaching responsibilities, but the letter does note that she has “received high scores in lecture evaluations from a variety of audiences such as students and conference attendees.”  It would seem that her teaching experience is very limited, and there is no indication that she has taught anything about health policy.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
This candidate is licensed as an RN in NY and Korea, and is certified in infection control and epidemiology.  She documents clinical practice (as an infection control nurse) in Korea through 2007,but has had no clinical experience in the US.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
She is a member of various US and Korean associations that focus on infection control, serves currently as VP of the NC Korean Nurses Association, and was a Board member 92006-08) for the Korean national  certification exam for APNs in infection control.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Her initial job as an RN in Korea was for 3 years (2000-03), followed by 4 years (2003-07) as an infection control nurse in Korea.  Since then, she has been a lecturer for 2 different organizations for a few months each, an RA (2009-10) and TA/Recruiter (2010-12) at UNC, and a healthcare-associated infections analyst (for 2 semesters) with the UNC Healthcare System.  

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Her area of work related to infection control seems promising, but I see no preparation or experience related to health policy in general.  There is no indication that she understands how US policy-making bodies work (other than, perhaps, within a hospital and related to infection control policies).  I do not think this candidate would be qualified to teach such courses in the DNP program.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
He completed a DNP at Johns Hopkins in 2009 but I don’t see any publications or indication of his capstone or similar project on his CV. He has presented at national anesthesia conferences. 


B.	Focused program of research
Not evident in CV or cover letter. Would need to explore this further. Has mentored students in conducting translational scholarly work which he reports has been presented at conferences as well.

C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has good experience teaching in anesthesia program in Raleigh and associated with UNC-G. Also has experience with accreditation process which would be very helpful to have now at DUSON. Also has training and experience in ways to move anesthesia programs from MSN to DNP – also helpful asset. 


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has current practice as CRNA. Also has experience internationally – is now taking second CRNA student group to Dominical Republic on service trip which would be a phenomenal and fitting addition potentially to the DUSON CRNA program given the school’s connections and mission.

E.	Service to the profession
Member of national professional organizations; as well as school committees. 

F.	 Job stability
No apparent concerns.

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Seems to be excellent fit with mission of the school and needs of the NAP. Has teaching and clinical experience; holds a practice doctorate (although would explore further what he wants to do with this and why no pubs); has international connections for clinical learning rotations; has accreditation and DNP development expertise. 

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
I would recommend a phone screen to explore his fit more fully..but appears to be an excellent candidate for this position.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
Conduct phone screen to determine qualifications for and interest in teaching Adult Health in the ABSN program.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
This individual earned his BSN in 2004 and MSN (with a focus in health systems management) in 2006, and expects to complete the PhD in 2012.  All his nursing degrees are from UVA, and he completed a BS in Health Services Administration prior to starting his nursing career.  He has had good beginning experiences as an RA and Research Coordinator on others’ grants, was the Co-PI/Trainee on a NLM “informatics” project related to patient falls, and is the PI on Pre-Doc NRSA award to support his dissertation.  He has 1 article from his dissertation in review, 1 in American Nurse Today (2011), 1 in Journal of AMIA (2010)(from the NLM funded project), and 1 in Supportive Care in Cancer (2011)(which is not tied to any practice or research work documented).  He has done 3 presentations related to his area of scholarship (falls and hip fractures) at regional/ national conferences.  He shows promise as a new PhD.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
His areas of research interest are clear – effects of health policies and health care systems on the health and functioning of older adults, health disparities and minority aging, quality and patient safety in in-patient rehab facilities, and care coordination and transitions of patients from post-acute care settings to home – though he does not articulate any specific “next steps” for his research.  His letter indicates that a goal of his is to “help shape the development of evidence-based health policies regarding the delivery of services to older adults with hip fractures over an episode of post-acute care.”

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
This candidate has served as a TA for 3 years while in his PhD program.  The letter indicates he has done co-teaching, curricula planning and evaluation of courses … undergraduate and graduate.  There is no evidence of his having had any course responsibility or responsibilities related to clinical teaching, student advisement, etc.  His letter suggests he would like to teach research.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
This is limited.  He has a total of 4 years of clinical practice, 3 as a staff nurse in a SNF/rehab center and 1 as the Assistant Director of Home Health Services at a senior living community.  He documents no certifications.  He has no experience in the acute care setting (which would probably be important for the ABSN Adult Health position), and he holds no certifications.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
This candidate is a member of several associations that relate to his area of research.  To date, he has no involvement on committees, as an officer, or as a volunteer.

JOB STABILITY  …  
His “jobs” have been rather short-term, probably because of his involvement in school.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
As a new scientist, he would seem to be “primed” for a research career.  However, I am concerned about his preparation for, experience related to, and interest in teaching Adult Health in the ABSN program.  I also question whether another faculty member whose research interests relate to the elderly, falls, and so on would serve to broaden the expertise on DUSON’s faculty.</Comment>

<Comment>Telephone Screening Interview:

Recommendation:  I am vacilating on my recommendation for this candidate.  She is a very experienced FNP and clinician and has 3-4 semesters of good clinical and classroom (MSN) teaching at UNC-CH.  She has taken a couple of courses in Nursing Education as a DNP student at Vanderbilt.   She has no scholarship.  She seemed fairly certain that she would be finished her DNP by August 2012 but &quot;not totally certain&quot;.   She seemed more passionate about pediatric end of the FNP continuum. 

She has her MSN as an FNP and then did a post masters PNP.  She is currently in a DNP program. 

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
She feels that NPs are the key to the future of the health care system.  Thus her goal is to obtain a faculty position so that she can play a role in educating the future.  She wants to be involved in teaching (classroom and clinical) and making improvements to the FNP program.  Eg., integration of active teaching process; integration of complimentary therapies. 
Her long term goals are related to becoming a member of a university in which students graduate to impact the health of future generations.  
B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She would like to take her clinical experience and past teaching experience to a new level and influence teaching programs. 

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She has a colleague in oncology program at Duke who spoke very highly of the school in terms of support and education.  But she feels that the school has a very excellent reputation.  It is also a good location for her since she lives in Cary, NC.

D.  What are your strengths?
As a result of being in the Navy for &gt; 26 years she is very flexible and thrives on change.  She has great versatility in clinical background while in the Navy.  Took on leadership positions while in Navy.  
-Navy also brought a lot of teaching opportunities. 

E. What are your weaknesses?
She feels that her lack of opportunity to focus on scholarship is a weakness.   She no publications and could not list scholarly presentations because she did not have the dates for these. 

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
She felt that staying sane through the DNP program was a great accomplishment but is also very proud to have served in the Navy.  Was selected to be in Navy. 

G.	What is your teaching passion?
She has taught, as a clinical instructor, across two NP courses at UNC-CH. She taught for 2 semesters as a clinical instructor in the FNP program while students were in pediatric section of the course.  She had an opportunity to grade.  She served as the course coordinator for one semester  in  the PNP program for a course on care of the chronically ill child. 

She has taken 2 education courses while in DNP program at Vanderbilt. One course on curriculum and how to write syllabus and an evaluation course. 

•	Class size:   She is willing to teach any size class but feels the smaller classes are more effective.

•	Clinical groups: Yes.

<Comment>Recommend a campus visit

What are your goals for a faculty position? 
I want to be able to continue my research in an environment where people have similar interest and the desire to mentor and support a junior faculty member. I want to be able to exist in an environment where I can work towards establishing myself as a PhD prepared researcher and educator.
Why duke??
I am interested in Duke because of the academic reputation of Duke and the organizational structure that supports the growth of junior faculty researchers. I also see several faculty members on the website who have similar interest as mine.

What are your strengths? 
The work I have done with the translational of information working with secondary analysis of large data sets.  I really enjoy working with the vast data available for further analysis and exploration. There is a cadre of individuals who have strengths in this area and I believe my doctoral work is preparing me to be one of those individuals.  

What are you weaknesses? 
Learning to balance and not over extend myself. I want to do everything and sometimes that is just not realistic.

What is your most significant accomplishment? 
Besides my family earning my PhD and following y passion for this population. I love the aging population and the focus on rehabilitation and improved quality of life my research outcomes can lead to.
What is your teaching passion? 
I like being in the classroom and sharing what I know about patient care with students

What are your practice interests? 
When I asked him about his previous positions in clinical practice and shared with him this was an adult health position with an acute care focus, he was taken off guard and stated he thought the position was focus on the adult health needs of the older client. He did say his training was in acute care settings but his focus in clinical practice has been  on the older adult. However, he was open to new opportunities.

Future research
I would like to continue to look at post-acute care and management of the older adult specifically in relation to policy development and utilization metrics for length of stay after THR. I have really thought about my research and how it will help with the establishment of EB policy and procedures regarding care of the older adult in long-term care and rehab facilities.

What contributions would you make to DUSON? 
“I am a very diverse candidate. I am an African American male and can make contributions related to the perspective of African Americans, African American males and males. This will assist in providing great insight and facilitation of the needs of these populations. I also think my focus on research in the aging populations along with my expertise in long-term care and rehab along with skills in secondary analysis is a plus.”

Tell me more about your responsibility in the academic positions you have held?
My role was to support faculty members in these roles. I was responsible for grading papers and leading groups in literature critique. I conducted lectures with a focus on older adults in foundations health assessment and have led a few on-line chats and lectures on secondary analysis and created some resources around secondary analysis from my work.
I found his teaching experience and practice based knowledge in care of the adult health acute care client to be weak. However, I think his experience is transferable and he has the willingness to teach in the ABSN program. He was enthusiastic, clearly articulated his goals and willingness to grow and be mentored.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
This candidate has strength as an NP and seems to have some limited teaching experience (online).  However, there is limited evidence of contributions in other areas, and his cover letter makes me question if he intends to stay in NY and engage with DUSON only online.  It also looks like he plans to complete his DNP in December 2012, so that would need to be verified.  I recommend a phone screen to clarify these areas, though I could easily accept a “reject” if that is the sense of the committee.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
This candidate documents no scholarly activities … no research, no grants (not even applications), no publications, and no presentations.  He does not even speak to the focus of his DNP “capstone” project.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
None

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
The resume notes that he “works as a mentor in the DNP program,” but that is not explained in the resume or letter.  He also notes that he is an adjunct faculty member in nursing – “Hybrid Cohort Professor in Pharmacology” – in the online MSN program.  It’s not clear what kind of responsibility he has for this course … full responsibility, or guest lectures, or a TA?  His letter says nothing about his teaching experience.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
He has been an NP for more than 10 years, with all of this work being in acute care settings, not primary care.  I do not know what the MSN needs are regarding acute vs. primary care.  In his current position as Chief NP for Emergency Medicine, he has extensive responsibilities that suggest he is quite competent.  He also serves as a consultant for a firm, which suggests his expertise is recognized and respected.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
The resume notes that he was his school’s president and NSNA recruiter, but he documents no membership – let along involvement – in professional associations.  I find this troublesome since he has been an RN since 1997 and an NP since 2000.

JOB STABILITY  …  
He is in his current position for approximately 10 years.  In addition to this position (which I assume is FT, given the title), he also holds 3 other positions (2 as adjunct faculty in 2 different universities since October 2011 and 1 since 2004).  I wonder how he manages all 4 of these jobs, in addition to his DNP program.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
I must say I was “turned off” by all the references in his cover letter to MEDICINE and MEDICAL professionals and the evolution of the MEDICAL field.  There was nothing in his letter that spoke to NURSING.  His letter also talked about wanting to be “part of the administrative staff.”  Does he understand what an academic institution is and what it would mean to be a faculty member?  I’m not sure.  While he was clear that he would want to maintain a clinical practice, his statement about wanting to “continue to advance … educationally and as a person” was quite vague.  Quite frankly, I suppose he could teach NP courses, but I am not confident that he would contribute in any other way.</Comment>

Candidate:       Johanna Newman		 Position:  NAP AD


Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

The candidate has on first authored publication in 2004. Capstone project was the use of simulation for teaching non-routine events in anesthesia. However, the candidate does not mention in CV or cover letter how this will be expanded on in future work. Is a peer reviewer for the ISJONA and item writer for the self-evaluation examination committee at the NBCRNA.  The CV does not reflect any scholarly presentation to profession organizations or groups.

The candidate does not really identify a specific area of research interest other the capstone.


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Since 2008 has served in as course coordinator or lecturer in a variety of nurse anesthesia courses. Has taught both clinical and didactic components in the nurse anesthesia program where she is currently the Assistant Department chair. CV also indicates candidate has done some service projects working with nurse anesthesia students on mission trips and in community project


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Recommendation:  Phone interview.  Assertively pursue this candidate. 

Since 2003 has been an associate professor at Virginia Tech’s School of Education in the Educational Research and Evaluation (EDRE) program.



Areas of Evaluation

A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Excellent:  
He has authored and co-authored 17 methodological and application articles in peer-reviewed journals.  Has also produced three methodological book chapters such as Miyazaki (2007) and Kamata, Bauer, and Miyazaki (2008). 

B.	Focused program of research
Received a Ph.D. in measurement and quantitative methods in 2000 from the College of Education at Michigan State University. 

Has an interest in developing and applying hierarchical models by combining other methodologies, such as structural equation modeling and item response theory models to address both substantive and technical research questions. Currently, working on developing models that combine HLM growth models and IRT measurement models in longitudinal data collected by complex sampling schemes to address the nature of change and growth and value-added questions. Current and future lines of study are developing models and methods by combining the strength of different methodologies with HLM.

Provides statistical consultation to faculty and doctoral student research and serve as a statistical investigator on both funded and unfunded research projects. I have supported faculty members at Virginia Tech in the departments of Education, Psychology, Human Development, and Biochemistry. In 2009, he served as statistician for a funded project on the effect of career and technical education training on
prisoner&apos;s recidivisms. His responsibilities included data cleaning, statistical analyses, and report writing to the sponsor.  Has extensive experience in helping scholars in health sciences. Before coming to Virginia Tech,  he was a research scientist at the Center of Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan.  Here he  provided statistical consultations to research scientists, who were faculty members in the medical school, psychology, public health, and social work. He assisted with grant proposals by writing statistical analysis plans and by obtaining required sample sizes through power analysis.

He is currently working on a grant proposal for methodological research on HLM from the U.S. Department of Education. Works as Co-PI or statistician with  faculty in education, psychology, and human development. 

Research focus areas is longitudinal data analysis using HLM, referred to as the growth modeling (or trajectory analysis) in behavioral and social sciences. This statistical model elicits the individual trajectories of growth/change over time and tries to find the correlates of the changes that explain individual differences on growth trajectories. Uses SAS  including writing programs that implement a new statistical methodology. 

Designed a simulation study and wrote the code that demonstrates the impacts of data clustering on Cronbach’s alpha (book chapter, Miyazaki, 2009).


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

He has 10 years of graduate-level teaching experience at Virginia Tech and Michigan State University. Taught graduate-level introductory research method courses at Virginia Tech for nine years;  taught intermediate level courses, such as experimental designs and multivariate analysis that focuses on factor analysis (both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis);  taught advanced courses such as hierarchical linear models (HLM) and longitudinal data analysis;  developed an HLM course that became the core course for the EDRE program;  developed a longitudinal data analysis course, which has been implemented as a special topic for advanced statistics in EDRE. 

He has served on nine doctoral dissertation committees as chair and co-chair, and as a committee member for 27 students from fields such as education, human development, psychology, and sociology. As the chair (or co-chair) of the dissertation committees, he played a major role in guiding students for statistical analyses, interpreting results, and writing dissertations. I advised students

At Virg Tech he served as the curriculum specialist in the college graduate curriculum committee (2011 - present), the department representative of the college diversity committee (2006 - 2011), and as a member of the student award committee (2010-present) and the college library committee (2003 - 2006). Within the department, he served as the EDRE lab coordinator between 2004 and 2011, which included maintaining computer hardware/software, guiding graduate assistants, and offering tutorial sessions for statistical and measurement software use. I also served as the search committee member for three faculty positions and one assistant director of information technology.

Outside of the university, he is actively involved in the American Educational Research Association (AREA), National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), and the International Meeting of Psychometric Society. He serves on the editorial board of Behaviometrika, a prestigious methodological journal published by the Behaviormetric Society of Japan. He serves  as a reviewer for AREA and NCME proposals, and a manuscript reviewer for the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Psychological Methods, Applied Psychological Measurement, and others.

<Comment>Telephone Screening Interview :  Yasuo Miyazaki

He is away for the summer visiting family in Japan.  Will return to the US on August 3rd. 
I recommend that we conduct a Skype interview with this candidate and include DHD and stats faculty member on the call.  If all goes well we can invite him for a campus interview in August. 

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

He has been wanting to transition from educational research to health sciences research. He has an interest in combining his knowledge on educational research (measurement models &amp; factor analysis) with health sciences research.  
His short term goals are to continue to teach introductory, intermediate, and advanced statistical courses.  To continue to consult on faculty research grants.  
His personal area of research interest is in childhood obesity.  He has conducted some analyses in this area and would like to collaborate with faculty on childhood obesity research. He is looking for research collaborators. He wants to do both methodological and applied research on the topic of childhood obesity.

<Comment>Comments from J levy&apos;s skype session
•	From a statistical perspective, he has very solid skills in longitudinal data analysis.  
•	His statistical exposure has been limited to the social sciences – which is OK. But he will have some learning to do in biostatistics. I think he would enjoy it.
•	He would be a great colleague to Ruth and Kirsten and his work is directly applicable to theirs. 
•	One question he asked was about our access to mathematical statistical consultants. I said that right now we have no arrangements for that but it is a great idea and I think we should initiate this – especially since there are now three doctoral level statisticians – and perhaps we will have four. 
•	I am not sure why he wants to come to Duke or why he is changing jobs at this point. I am worried that he wants to come mostly for the prestige and does not in fact have a real interest in either nursing or health sciences. But that is only a gut feeling and I could be very wrong.
•	His questions of me were around the extent of work and then he emailed me a question about the amount of money in our discretionary funds. Regarding the work load issue I responded honestly and said that I work most Saturday afternoons, 1 or 2  evenings and once in a while Sunday afternoons as well. He did not like that and asked if that might be lessened with more statisticians. 
•	He is interested in doing methodological work. I do not think he understands the large service component of this position. 
•	He would like to take a large block of time off in the summer. I told him that he would have to negotiate this. 


I think he definitely warrants an in person interview. My gut level reaction is that he is very competent but does not have quite the right motives.  I would never think to ask about discretionary funds on a screening interview. In my mind, it is poor form to ask much about money in the screening phase. But that is a “style” issue. Something nags at me about him though.</Comment>

<Comment>Candidate has potential to make contributions to DUSON. Would recommend campus visit

What are your goals for a faculty position? 
Want to get in an academic setting where I can combine interest in research, teaching and practice. I also want to be where I can collaborate with other experts in the field.
Why duke?? I am interested in Duke because the position focuses on the informatics domain in health and clinical informatics. It is also a good opportunity for me because of the ability to combine aspects of teaching, research and practice of nursing informatics together which is mainly my interest. I want to explore more about health informatics in more practical ways. Another main focus for me is the association at Duke with the hospital and health care environments which are good opportunities for the new development and evaluation, which would be satisfying for me.
What are your strengths? 
I have a multidisciplinary background, medicine was my first degree. I have long-term experience in this field on the technical side and medical side. On the medical side, I am comfortable. On the technical side, I am a fast learner and I pick up things fast. I have a lot of practical experience in database and??? Development.
What are you weaknesses? English is not my first language. I am able to communicate with others but it might be hard for me to relate or tell a joke for example. Sometimes it is a challenge.

What is your most significant accomplishment? 
My PhD thesis, and having 3 manuscripts published in reputable journals. I explored the feasibility of including molecular genetic information into the HER. Doing this project allowed me to construct the first knowledge base about cystic fibrosis including molecular genetics and health care. I was able to connect the OWL knowledge base with HER database. Developed new graphic methods to analyze large datasets by using frequencies and hierarchal modeling??? Developed online user friendly knowledge management tool (LITE) Librarian Infobutton Tailoring Environment, to be used at the point of care.
What is your teaching passion? 
I have experience of delivering tutorials and presentations. I also took an online class on how to teach which was organized by NIH. It basically covered teaching in American universities, how to develop a syllabus, and be a good teacher.
What are your practice interests? 
I have been working in this area for 10 years. I want to make an impact by doing research with hopes that my research can be used in rural practice by clinicians to improve work experience and patient outcomes. I also want to educate more individuals in this field.

Future research
My main interests are information needs and doing clinical information need consultations. I am also interested in creating information aids in the clinical settings. I want to examine how to improve use of clinical notes and improve secondary use of clinical notes.
I want to do more research and gain more funding to improve healthcare

What contributions would you make to DUSON? 
My knowledge base and skills in technical aspects of informatics research and my ability to carry a project forward. Collaboration with other has always been a strength, for example my work with Dr. Cimino.</Comment>

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
No program of research outlined, which is understandable, though does note research interests in patient safety, QI, and team-based response systems.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has been a Clinical Associate at DUSON x 5 years, serving as a preceptor for MSN students.  Has been a Contract Faculty at DUSON x 3 years, serving as a guest lecturer in several courses, a simulation facilitator, and a facilitator of SON/SOM collaboration small group activities for ABSN and ACPNP students.  Knows our programs.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
Extended clinical practice in an NP role.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Involved in several committees at DUHS, as well as APN Committee of Society of Critical Care Medicine, President-Elect of Raleigh chapter of NAPNAP, and exam committee member of Peds National Certification Board.  She also is a reviewer for the Society of Critical Care Medicine (abstracts) and J Peds Health Care (manuscripts).  All speak to acknowledgement of her expertise.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No concerns

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
My recommendation would be NOT to pursue, but I would defer to the reviews by Constance and Rachael.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
2 small grants (2003 &amp; 2005); neither relate to informatics.  Presented “patient-centered medical home” at DNP conference in 2012; 2 other presentations are on clinical issues and were in 2004 &amp; 1997.  One publication in 1997 on NP role.   DNP is new (2011), but has had MSN since 1981, so I would have expected more scholarship than is documented.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Not prepared as a researcher, so no research is documented.  Letter indicates that she “seeks to continue research in the field of healthcare informatics,” but no specific directions are offered.  


TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
CI at U Tennessee in 1983 (1 semester? calendar year?), Clinical site evaluator for FNP students (whatever that means!) at DUSON x 3 years, 1 year as Peds instructor at Nazareth College, 1 year teaching Adult Health at Clemson, and teaching Community Mental Health at U South Alabama in 2012 (1 semester?).  None of these teaching experiences have anything to do with informatics.   This concerns me.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE …
Good clinical experience as PNP and FNP.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Lists membership in several organizations, but indicated no degree of involvement in any of them … not even at the local level.  This concerns me for someone who has been an NP for more than 30 years.

JOB STABILITY  …  
This worries me.  She has had several “short stints” in academic positions, and in clinical positions.  She just started at U South Alabama in 2012 … why is she looking to leave already?

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Her letter indicates that she has completed electives in Informatics at U Colorado-Denver, under the guidance of Diane Skiba, who is very well known in the Informatics world.  She has an Educator’s Certificate in Health Informatics and will earn a PMC in Health Informatics from Denver after 2 more courses.  Additionally, her DNP project assessed health literacy and promoted development of health literacy skills in mothers.  Despite these facts, however, I do not get a sense of a strong background in Informatics.  I wonder if her seemingly novice level of knowledge and lack of leadership in the field would be a disservice to our students?</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
I would be OK with a phone screen since Constance rated this candidate as her #2 choice, but I am not overly impressed with him (her?).

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Has been an RA in the health systems lab with Dr. Patty Brennan, a leader in Informatics.  Is currently doing a post-doc at Western Polytechnic Institute (MA), where he was part of a research team that developed an AHRQ proposal.  However, I see no evidence that this or any other research proposal has been funded, and the publication record is scant … 1 book chapter in 2005, 1 article in 2007, and 1 article “forthcoming.”  Has presented a poster related to informatics at the 2007, 2008 and 2010 (x2) AMIA Annual Symposia and participated on a panel at their 2011 Symposium.  Other presentations focus on workflow.  [This candidate’s research related to workflow may be very relevant to Informatics, but I do not know that … and without that knowledge, it seems unrelated to me … interesting, but unrelated to the position being explored.]

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
CV outlines research interests related to health care delivery systems and evaluation of information systems.  No clear trajectory of research outlined in letter or CV.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Has been a guest lecturer in several courses, a TA in 3 courses (Informatics, Teaching in Global Classroom, and Marketing), and a co-instructor for Research &amp; Design in Home Care.  Scope of responsibilities as a co-teacher is unclear, and focus of teaching (to me) seems to be “all over the place.”

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE …
N/A

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
Peer reviewer for several journals and is engaged professionally in other ways.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Seems to be fairly stable in jobs … 3 years, 3 years, 1 year, 4 years, and current position (post-doc) since August 2011.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
It is probably related to my lack of understanding of the scope of Informatics, but to me, this candidate’s academic background in engineering, his focus on health management, and his “scattered” experience with Informatics (as I know it) raise questions in my mind about his ability to contribute to our program.  Constance is the best judge of all this, and I, of course, defer to her recommendations.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
I’ve worked with Liz in Education courses and on an independent study project, and I like her, but I do not think she is a particularly strong candidate for this position.  Need to confirm DNP completion date.

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Liz has not prepared as a researcher, so it’s no surprise that her CV does not document research or funding.  She documents a 2010 book chapter and a 2010 article (in collaboration with Jane Blood-Siegfried), but there are no other publications.  In addition to some local presentations, Liz has presented at NAPNAP (2010 &amp; 2006)), AANN (2009 &amp; 2008), NC School Nurses regional and state conferences (2009 &amp;2008), and the Duke Pediatric Neurology Symposium (2011 &amp; 2009).

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
Again, this is not a researcher, so there is no focused program of research.  Liz’s experience in establishing (with her pediatric neurologist colleagues) the Duke Pediatric Headache Clinic in 2001, her capstone project related to headaches in school-age children, and her ongoing work with a DUSON student on an independent study to extend the work of her capstone project clearly indicates her continually evolving expertise and care improvement efforts related to this health problem.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Liz has completed 9 Education credits while in her DNP program, and her letter indicates that she has taught N441 with Jane B-S and independently.  She also has been a preceptor for PNP and FNP students and has been a guest speaker.  She would be a novice teacher, but she does have some foundation of theoretical knowledge and some experience.

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE …
NP since 2000 … PNP and PMC in Peds Acute Care.  She has been a PNP in Pediatric Neurology at DUMC since 2000, focusing primarily on children with headaches.

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
No involvement in professional associations, journal reviewing, or DUHS committees is documented.

JOB STABILITY  …  
No problem here.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
A viable candidate, but not a particularly strong one.  Additionally, although her PMC is in Peds ACUTE, her practice for the past 12 years has been in an out-patient clinic, not in the “acute care side of the house.”</Comment>

in 1985. 

E.	Service to the profession

Is a member of the APhA but does not lite service roles.

F.	 Job stability
No concerns 

G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Course she has taught at DTTC are similar to types we may need for NP students. I am comfortable with teaching experience and potential for partnerships using expertise in pharmacology/pharmacy with faculty.
Would recommend a phone screen .</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION  …  
Do not pursue … though I would certainly be OK with a phone screen if our Informatics faculty see this candidate as viable

RESEARCH FUNDING &amp; PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  
Individual earned an MSc in 2009 and has been enrolled in a PhD program since … expects to graduate in October 1012.  His thesis focuses in biomedical informatics.  His CV documents “academic research experiences” (1 of which is his work as a PhD student, and 1 of which was an industry collaborative on e-learning applications) and “biomedical informatics research visits” (which seem to be short-term work with tutors).  It’s difficult for me to judge what these experiences mean.  He is the lead author on a 2012 publication in the AMIA journal, which is nice.  He also documents 3 conference presentations (I think), and 1 paper on ontologies in conference proceedings.  There is no grant involvement noted, but the system in Spain may be very different regarding PhD students writing grants, etc.

FOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  
His focus of research is on ontologies, but there is no explanation in his letter about future goals or a trajectory of research.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  
Candidate has taught a graduate-level course in advanced programming for 2 years.  To me, advanced programming is different from informatics, but … what do I know?  

RELEVANCE &amp; EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE …
N/A

SERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  
I see none documented on the CV … but I don’t know what is typical in Spain.

JOB STABILITY  …  
Most jobs have been short-term … I assume he has been a full-time student.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  
Other than the fact that he would bring diversity to the faculty (as a male whose “mother tongue” is Spanish), I am not convinced he would make a particularly unique contribution to meet our needs.  His letter is well-written, so English does not seem to be any problem for him.  Overall, I was not particularly impressed with this candidate, but – again – would defer to my Informatics candidates’ evaluation of his potential.</Comment>

RECOMMENDATION
On-campus interview

WHAT ARE YOUR SHORT AND LONG-TERM GOALS FOR A FACULTY POSITION?
Short-term  …  Secure a FT faculty position and learn the full scope of that role.  I’ve “eased into” some aspects of the role as a contract faculty member at DUSON (teaching, managing courses, engaging in simulation activities), but I’ve not been involved in curriculum work, admissions, and so on. 
Long-term  …  Be a fully contributing member of a faculty, while maintaining a practice role and engaging in scholarly work [see below]

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)
I’ve always wanted to be in an academic role … my father is a professor, and I love hearing him talk about the success of his students, etc.  I also would like the opportunity to continue to balance teaching and practice.  I’ve seen faculty in the role and am energized about how passionate they are about what they do.  I’d like to add to my “skill set” by becoming more competent in curriculum development, etc.

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  
As a contract faculty member, I’ve been “on the fringes” of activities at DUSON and am excited about what I see faculty and students doing.  I know the health system and have many good connections and strong professional relationships with individuals there that I’d like to maintain … and use to the advantage of students … and I just love this place.  I’ve been a student here and a contract faculty, and I really can’t imagine being anywhere else.  This is the place for me!

WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
I know DUSON, DUHS and Duke.  I am a strong clinician and leader in the health system, and am on committees that are trying to affect change in the system.  I attend Teaching Conversations and really learn a great deal from the exchange of ideas, and I’ve had strong mentors who I know I can continue to call on as I move into a new role.

WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?
I really do not know the formality of what it is to be a faculty member.  Although I’ve been successful as a teacher, I’ve done that with no preparation in teaching … so I would need to learn more about teaching principles, etc.  

WHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?
I went to DUHS to develop the clinical team in the PICU.  I realized that part of team development would be the initial and ongoing preparation of members of the team, so I connected with Sharron Docherty, and we worked together to develop the team and, at the same time, precept students.  I am recognized as an expert clinician and am being asked more and more to help others develop similar programs.  I also am working with UAB faculty to help them think through how to do their combined primary/acute care PNP program online using simulations.

WHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION” … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE
I love using case studies and simulation.  I’ve worked primarily with small groups of students (N=12), so larger groups might be a challenge.  I have not taught online, but I was a student in the online DNP program.  

WHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?
I’m very interested in process improvement work that will ensure the safety of patients and effective functioning of teams in emergency situations.  I did some work on this for my DNP capstone, and that work has “uncovered” other aspects of the system that need attention and improvement.  As a member of the health system patient safety committee, I’m working with others to begin to design ways to improve our processes during emergencies.

WHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?
I definitely want to maintain a practice role, and have talked with my MD colleague about that possibility; he is most supportive and has suggested some unique ways I might be able to stay involved were I to move into a full-time faculty position.

ISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
Not applicable.
FYI … The “in press” article is expected to be published in October.
FYI  …  The “SON/SOM collaboration small group facilitator” was working with Beth Phillips on the collaborative efforts between ABSN and SOM students.</Comment>

Overall Assessment:  This is an excellent candidate with great passion and experience as a statistician in 2 schools of nursing.  I recommend that we recommend a campus visit. 

A.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
-Longterm:  To continue to develop his methodological and substantive research program.  In addition to his interest in longitudinal statistical methods he has develop a program of research surrounding the statistical needs and methods of nursing scientists. After working as a statistician in two schools of nursing he has realized a need to understand the analysis needs of nursing scientists. Currently there are no statistical competencies for nursing scientists.  Nobody has rigorously studied the needs of nursing scientists.  He would like to develop the evidence for this. He has a 10 year plan that includes 6 descriptive studies.   He also wants to study the role of the statistician in schools of nursing. 
He has established a network of statisticians in nursing schools and organized a listserve.   

B.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
He was trained as a biostatistician and worked at NIH and NASA as a biostatistician. But over the past 4 years he has worked in academic nursing setting as the sole statistician.  He has really found a passion for this work in the field of nursing b/c of the balance between research/teaching.  He really enjoys the full range of studies and methodologies from across the lifespan and range of substantive areas.  He was at Johns Hopkins for 3-4 years and then left to take a position at Rutgers. His draw to Rutgers was a new Dean who had a desire to build the research program in that school.  However, in the very near future Rutgers will be merging with the New Jersey State School University.  This merger will likely eliminate many nontenured faculty positions and will have a deleterious impact on the research program of that school. 

C.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Interested in working at a research intensive university.  Duke as a superior reputation.   DUSON and the Dean have an excellent reputation for the commitment to being a research one institution. 

D.	What are your strengths?
His experience in the nursing field (4 years).  He has worked on a wide range of research projects.  .  He was the sole biostatistician at Hopkins and Rutgers. Has the bigger picture mind set of what the role requires.  He has a passion for consulting on a research team in the early stages of project.  
He is a good communicator.  Likes to discuss clearly his role. 
-lots of experience with NIH pre-award support. 
-passion in teaching.  Especially PhD students. Finds it very interesting working with these students. 

E.	What are your weaknesses?
-difficulty saying no.  Can get in easily over his head because of the difficulty saying no. 

F.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
-worked with NIH for 7-8 years, then moved to Hopkins, then to Rutgers.  All of these steps have led him to this path to developing what are the statistical methods needs for nursing scientistists.  He was co-editor of a special edition of Nursing Research on statistics in nursing. 
-this past year at the Annual Joint Statistical Meetings (several statistical societies (over 5000 statisticians attend) he organized 3 - 4 sessions for statisticians in nursing. 1. Round table discussion on topic of statistics education for graduate nursing students. Pedagogy, assessment.  2. A panel of 5 statisticians working in the nursing field.  Each gave 15 minute talk about the set up in their particular field.  3. Session on consulting in an interdisciplinary nursing environment.   

G.	What is your teaching passion?
•	Class size:  his teaching experience ranges from very large classes (in biostatistics department); 30-50 students; 8 student’s in PhD program.   Developed a course at Hopkins for PhD students on mixed models and longitudinal analysis. 
•	Clinical groups: N/A
•	Online:  has not done any online teaching.  Has only done face to face.  Realizes that he will need to develop his skills in this area. 
•	
H.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
He desires a position that will allow him to develop his program of research on the statistical competencies of nursing researchers and pedagogical methods for teaching statistics. 

I.	What are your practice interests?  N/A

Areas of Evaluation
A.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
2 grants on CV and one is under review….does not appear to be at appropriate level for his current Professor position to carry to DUSON under APT criteria.


B.	Focused program of research
Research (although recently states moving toward genetics and bioinformatics) is very analysis, stats focused and seems much more along the lines of his graduate preparation in mathematics which wouldn’t necessarily fit with a position here. 


C.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
20 years of experience but courses listed don’t seem to match the focus here on health informatics or even informatics in general – again very mathematics/stats focused.


D.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A


E.	Service to the profession
Reviewer (grants) ; university level service. 


F.	 Job stability
Has been in current position for over 20 years – why interested in change now? 


G.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

His overall interests – research and teaching – do not appear to fit the needs here. He doesn’t ONCE mention nursing or even the school of nursing? 

H.	Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

Does not appear to be a fit – recommend regret letter</Comment>

<Comment>What are your goals for a faculty position? 
Overall goal is to teach on the university level. Been working as a consultant and teaching at an associate level. I want to be able to continue my research in an environment where people have similar interest and the desire to mentor and support a junior faculty member. I want to be able to exist in an environment where I can work towards establishing myself as a PhD prepared researcher and educator.
Why duke??
Love to teach and love teaching pharm. Think I have developed good teaching skills and I think I am ready to teach at a higher level. I am consulting  at UNC and I like atmosphere where research and dynamics of institution which is conducive to growth.

What are your strengths? 
Teaching skills based on evaluations. I think I am good at conveying information in an interesting and relevant manner. Just recently I completed graduate certificate in e-learning.  This has helped me with my strength in online teaching.I also think I have diversity in skills like teaching, research, and practice.
What are you weaknesses? 
I am not a too specialized. I am particularly very familiar with oncology but other than that my skills are not specialty specific.
What is your most significant accomplishment? 
Completing my PhD in pharm and the research which supported it, this led to clinical use of a  therapeutic class of drugs  and interventions for enhanced relaxation mediated by nitrous oxide. This work contributed to the use of drugs like Viagra being used clinically.
What is your teaching passion? 
Most of my classes are classroom. I have taught a fair number of labs. My passion lies in the classroom and student centered learning. Engaging the students and getting them to use the knowledge they have learned.
What are your practice interests? 
I have not practiced in a pharmacy in a number of years. But in my research I have been working on clinical studies protocols for 2nd &amp; 3rd line protocols for elderly individuals to determine the impact  on QOL and function in this population.
Future research
Clinical research, I am interested in QOL and new novel pharmacological approaches to cancer therapy.
What contributions would you make to DUSON? 
“My background in pharmacology.” It comes from the medical school and pharmacy perspective my recent education and e-learning. 
Discuss your scholarship it looks limited on you CV.
I work in a core group of researcher very early in the research process. So my publications are in association with their work in the early phase of development.  I also have experience reviewing textbooks and number of publication from my graduate research.

How do you think your skills will fit with the teaching expectation s as describe on the position announcement?
I have a good perspective on how drugs are to be used. What clinical tests need to be done to monitor effectiveness and I have worked with drugs at all phases of clinical development. 
I have been fairly active in simulating sterile preparation of medication. I also have actively taught a capstone course for the program reviewing pharmacy law and federal requirements. Feel like I am up to speed on pharmacy even though my practice is not current. I am staying active. I am not currently teaching graduate level students. The pharmacology is taught to the clinical trials researchers and usually I am more impeded by the fact that the students don’t understand clinical experience and background from a pharmacy perspective.

Scholarly presentation what would it be to demonstrate your strengths and abilities for the position?

I would present e-learning and instructional strategies which might be used to teach pharmacology.
I could also present research which I have done in the past but I would think you would be more interested in my teaching style.</Comment>

CANDIDATE NAME:		Julia Walker				  

DATE:				October 5, 2012			

RECOMMENDATION
On-campus visit

WHAT ARE YOUR SHORT AND LONG-TERM GOALS FOR A FACULTY POSITION?
Short term – Increase my teaching role and continue my research
Long term – Engage in research related to how best to teach Physiology … Develop interprofessional learning opportunities related to Physiology (e.g., medical and nursing students in the same course)

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)
My initial degree was in Education, and while I’ve enjoyed the work I’ve done in recent years and been fulfilled by it, “I always wanted to go back to teaching.”  This position would allow me to do more teaching.  It also would give me the opportunity to be integrated with faculty and students and “feel like I’m an integral part of something bigger.”

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  
I came to Duke in 2000 to do animal research in cell biology.  I did that for 4 years and then was appointed as a faculty member in the Division of Pulmonology.  Although I was a faculty member, I essentially was a “glorified post-doc,” spending all of my time doing research.  Duke is an excellent place, and the opportunity to have a “real” faculty position here is very exciting.

WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
I’m an independent investigator with a good funding record … I’m a good collaborator (both within and outside Duke) … I’m a good communicator (in writing and in lecturing/presenting, which translates to teaching others) … I do not necessarily think of myself as a leader, but people often look to me for that, and I’ve been successful in taking on that role … I’m a very disciplined person

WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?
I sometimes take on too much and can’t say “No.”  I would benefit from guidance on how to be better at not taking on too much but still making a significant contribution to the organization.

WHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?
I got a great deal of satisfaction from the NIH R01 award … to me, it was a vote of confidence from my peers that my work could make an important contribution to the field.  I also think a significant accomplishment when I see students have those “Aha moments” or when those who “fought” my pushing them come back to say how much they appreciated being pushed.

WHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION” … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE
I tend to push students to go outside their comfort zone.  I’m open to learning new pedagogical methods.  I have taught CRNA courses where some students were at a distant site, but I have not taught online.  I value problem-based learning and group work.  I think it’s easier to do PBL and group work in smaller classes, but I also think that with several faculty involved in the course, this can be facilitated in larger classes as well.  I would welcome the opportunity to co-teach, especially with a nurse who can enhance discussions be calling on her/his clinical experiences.

WHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?
I would like to continue to focus on respiratory problems, looking at overall lung function – and lung mechanisms – not just the cellular and sub-cellular levels.  As mentioned earlier, I also am interested in studying the most effective ways to help students learn Physiological concepts.

WHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?
N/A

ISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
Question from the Search Committee  What track is of most interest to you?  I want to challenge myself and think the tenure track would help me develop most, but I would not be happy to explore other track options as well.

Questions from Dr. Walker  What opportunities are there for leadership roles?  What is your timeline for completing the search and making this appointment?  I tried to answer these questions as best I could.

NOTE  Dr. Walker asks that her exploration of this position be kept CONFIDENTIAL for now.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION
Recommend campus visit  …  Constance Johnson rated this candidate #1 among our “pool,” and I agree that he has a great deal to offer

WHAT ARE YOUR SHORT AND LONG-TERM GOALS FOR A FACULTY POSITION?
Research  …  My short-term goal is to develop methodologies to better characterize work environments to better design health information systems.  Long-term, I hope to develop multi-level theories for Informatics (theories that guide individuals, units, health systems).
Teaching  …  My long-term goal is to be an excellent teacher.  Short-term, I want to enjoy the journey getting there.

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)
He is currently in a post-doc, not in a faculty position

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  
I understand that at Duke both teaching and research are important and valued.  I understand that the environment is supportive, and I think resources like the IEE are very helpful to faculty.  The Informatics Institute and the positive environment for research align with my interests and goals.

WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
I have worked with people from various fields on different projects and have come to appreciate the unique and important perspective each brings to the work.  Rather than using a “standard approach” as many engineers tend to do, I prefer to analyze problems by using systems thinking and putting a team together to find the best solution.

WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?
I would not say this is a “weakness,” but I always find it a challenge to keep my eyes open to possibilities, maintain my networks, and work in teams (primarily because everyone brings such a different point of view).

WHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?
I believe my greatest accomplishment is my dissertation – which focused on PATIENT-ORIENTED workflow methodology that accounts for cooperation and examined how information technology fits with and enhances a focus on the patient.

WHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION” … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE
I’ve attended workshops on teaching large classes and believe it’s not the class size that makes a difference but the nature of a course … some courses are better suited to small group seminars, and some work very well with large groups.  I’m comfortable with both.  I’ve been a TA for a DNP Nursing Informatics course, been a guest lecturer at DUSON (for Jane Peace), and taught online.  I’ve learned there are 3 key principles to be a great teacher … (1) teaching as research (where one incorporates research to improve one’s teaching) … (2) learning communities (where one collaborates with others to improve one’s teaching) … and (3) learning through diversity (understanding the diversity that exists in any classroom and recognizing the value of diverse views).  

WHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?
My overall research focus is on understanding and improving work systems in health settings.

WHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?
Not applicable

ISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS
(1)	Specific experience in health care and with nursing  …  My dissertation focused on work systems in health care settings.  I interviewed health care workers and observed nurses in ICU and the ED.  Additionally, I’ve had nurses in my lab which provided an opportunity for me to learn about their research.
(2)	What technical courses can you teach?  …  I could teach decision analysis.  With time, I could teach data mining and relational databases.  In reviewing DUSON’s courses, I believe I could teach N409, N412, N415, N416 and N653.  With time, I also could teach N655.  And I could possibly teach several statistics courses and aspects of methods courses that focused on field studies.
(3)	Status of the K99  …  I almost finished that grant but Worcester Polytechnic Institute could not “house” it, so I stopped.  I will develop the same idea as an RO-1 or RO-3 once I’m in a faculty position.
(4)	When will the post-doc fellowship end?  …  It is scheduled to end in July 2013, but it can end earlier if I have a job.  WPI has been supportive of that.
(5)	Status of 4 papers listed as “submitted/in preparation”  …  1 paper has been accepted, 1 has been returned with “major revisions needed” and I’m working on that, 1 is ready to submit within a week or so, and 1 will be submitted in early 2013.  I also am preparing my next AMIA paper to submit; it will be on visualization.
(6)	What health informatics courses have been taken?  …  I took health systems courses in my PhD program, but no health informatics courses.</Comment>

<Comment>RECOMMENDATION
Campus visit

WHAT ARE YOUR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM GOALS FOR A FACULTY POSITION?
Short-term, I want to establish a research program/specific area in social media and patient self- management.  Long-term, I want to (a) have funded grants, (b) establish collaborations within and outside Duke, and (c) have my work be part of the broader AMIA and HCI communities.

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)?
Not applicable … Currently a NIH-NLM post-doc fellow

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  
Duke is a great university with a top-ranked SON.  The SON fits well with my emphasis of focusing on the PATIENT and what will help him/her, an emphasis that is more than just being concerned with “informatics.”  I know you have experts in qualitative methods, which is relevant to my work.  The SON is engaged in and values research that “connects” with patients.

WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
I grew up being trained as a designer, then worked in Informatics, and then trained in a medical school in HEALTH Informatics … I believe this interdisciplinary perspective is a strength.  Also, I grew up in Korea and believe I can bring a sensitive to cultural awareness to my work and conversations about human/computer interactions.

WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?
I do not have a nursing background.

WHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?
I successfully moved from design to computer science to the health field.

WHAT IS YOUR TEACHING “PASSION” … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE?
To me, teaching is a rewarding experience.  I’ve taught Intro to Human/Computer Interaction via Skype to a SOM in Peru and found the virtual experience to be positive and effective.  I enjoy seminars and being able to engage in extended dialogue with learners, and I enjoy exploring various approaches to helping students best meet learning objectives.

WHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?
Using social media for patient self-management.  Currently I’m working with online communities and face-to-face groups with patients with diabetes.  In the face-to-face groups, there often is a health care provider engaged in the discussions, but that is not available for online communities.  I’d like to develop a system that will automatically pull postings made by health care professionals and insert them into the online patient conversations.  I realize I need to consider whether patient-only groups would want this kind of “insertion,” and, of course, how such a program is developed would be a real challenge.  I also want to see how underserved populations might benefit from this kind of resource.

WHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?
Not applicable

ISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS:
The K99/R00 grant submitted in the summer is “under review as we speak … the review panel is meeting today.”  The 2 papers submitted for the ACM 2013 annual conference have received good review scores, but no decision has been made yet on whether or not they will be accepted.  The book chapter that is “in press” has not yet come out; it’s a very slow process.  I have had full responsibility for teaching the Biomedical Informatics course at U Washington, and as a NLM Fellow, I teach some classes and mentor doctoral students.</Comment>

RECOMMENDATION
Campus visit

WHAT ARE YOUR SHORT AND LONG-TERM GOALS FOR A FACULTY POSITION?
SHORT – Set up a lab (which takes 6-12 months) and get research assistants so that I can continue my research … Get the “lay of the land” of the SON .. Contribute to teaching as well as write grants and get funding 
LONG – Contribute to the faculty through ongoing research, teaching and service .. Build a nationally and internationally recognized program of research .. Publish/disseminate the knowledge my research generates so that it impacts the care of patients

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)
“I’m paid to be curious, and I love that.”  But change builds character, and I’m looking for a challenge that will help me expand what I do so I continue to grow .. I would welcome a more “energized” environment and an attitude of “sure, we can do that,” which I know I’d find at Duke

WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  
I know the SON is ranked #7 and is outstanding, and Duke is ranked in the top 20 worldwide ...  Being at Duke would bring unique opportunities to work with “world class” people .. Resources available are excellent .. From my 5-week experience as a visiting professor, I got a real sense that Duke has a “can do” attitude, and I find that refreshing and energizing .. I have research collaborators in NC, so I could continue to work with them and my research would be seamless

WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?
I am VERY unique in terms of my trans-disciplinary training, and I “speak the language” of many disciplines .. I’m collaborative and, in fact, need to work with trans-disciplinary teams to answer the questions I raise through my research .. I am good at forming networks .. I’m passionate about my research and am always learning .. I write well and present routinely .. I love to teach and mentor students

WHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?
I’m pretty intense and sometimes need to calm down a bit and appreciate that not everyone shares the same passions .. I sometimes need to do better with balance in my life (e.g., working hard and family)

WHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?
My research related to heart failure – particularly as it relates to exercise – has impacted the care of those patients, and I’m recognized as an expert in this area (as noted by my appointment [the only Canadian] to the Heart Failure and Exercise Group of the National Heart and Lung Institute (NIH) and the recognition of our recent article on exercise and heart failure as the most influential paper on the subject.
I also am excited about a new area of research, that of cardio-oncology [see question below about research interests]

WHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE
I’m particularly passionate about mentoring students as they do their own research and helping them move to where they want to go, not where I think they should go.  I also teach an entry-level graduate PT course to 80 on-campus students + 50 distance-based students who participate through television cameras.  I also teach in the lab where we integrate knowledge with real patient situations … and real patients.  No one taught me how to teach, and although I’ve won awards for teaching, I consider myself a work in progress who could benefit from more guidance on how to be a good teacher.

WHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?
I am increasingly interested in the prevention of heart failure, not just the treatment of it.  My most recent area of research – one I anticipate will increasingly be the focus of my work – is cardio-oncology.  We are finding that women who have been treated for breast cancer survive that event only to have hearts that function at a capacity one would expect of someone 30 years older than what they actually are.  We are building a program around this area, and I’m one of the founding members of that team.  We established a clinic and are starting a large trial to study the impact on heart function of (a) typical treatment methods and (b) the involvement in  non-pharmacological methods (e.g., nutrition, exercise, etc.) through our clinic.  This has great potential to enhance cardiac function in women with or who have survived breast CA.

WHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?
Not applicable

<Comment>12/20/2012

Had a wonderful conversation with Dr. Haykowsky today.  Based upon our discussion I believe he would fit very well within the MSN program teaching Pathophysiology as a component of his teaching load as a senior researcher.  His preparation as an exercise physiologist and a registered nurse make him a very good fit to teach pathophysiology.  I also think he would have many areas for connection and scholarly work including cancer survivorship, cardiac dysfunction, musculoskeletal care, and exercise interventions for diabetes.

I would recommend we continue to recruit this candidate.

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :      Kalyani Ankem                                           			 Position:  Informatics

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Ankem has 11 publications; these publications are in the areas of information seeking and needs, the conduct of meta-analyses, and the effects of internet use. He has two grants, one as PI from the National Library of Science and another as a co-investigator from the University of Alabama. He was three Scholarships all from the University of Alabama.  

2.	Focused program of research. In his cover letter, Dr. Ankem wants to extend his program of research to “examine the effectiveness of clinical informatics applications and the factors that influence use of consumer health informatics applications.”  Unfortunately, there was little description of his research areas, specifically what his findings have been and what specific directions he wants to take his research.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs. He has taught numerous courses, such as: health information, evidence based practice, organization of information, research methods and quantitative methods. Further, he has developed such courses as: introduction to informatics, database design, information retrieval, nursing and healthcare informatics and evidence based practice in nursing and healthcare.  He has also been involved with Capstone. His teaching has targeted Master’s, DNP and Ph.D. students, with materials being delivered online and in blended formats. Overall, his teaching experiences seem to be a good fit with the position. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice. There is no evidence of clinical practice. However, he has provided help to faculty in terms of evaluating surveys, data management, acquiring and organizing materials.

5.	Service to the profession. He has served on numerous committees at the various institutions he was at. He has or is presently serving on several national/regional editorial boards. He is associated with several professional organizations (e.g., American Medical Informatics Association, Medical Library Association).  

6.	Job stability. Somewhat difficult to discern. It appears he was an Assistant Professor at Wayne State University from August 2001-May of 2005 in the Library and Information Science Program. It then appears he had a position as Associate Professor at North Carolina Central University, School of Library and information Sciences from August 2005-May of 2011. His current position, as of August 2011, is as Associate Professor at Emporia State University in the School of Library and Information Management. So overall, he has had some job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Overall, his teaching experiences and the courses he has taught would be a good match with DUSON. In particular, he is familiar with blending needs of different disciplines to create a program of education, as most recently evidenced at his current position at Emporia State University. In addition, he would probably contribute well in the area of service. It is less clear how his research interests would coincide with the interests of students and faculty because this area is the least developed in his application. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation: This applicant has notable strengths. It would be worthwhile to conduct a phone interview to at least get a better sense of his research interests. If would also be worthwhile to learn why he wants to leave his current position, which has been short in tenure.</Comment>

Applicant :  Kalyani Ankem                                               			 Position:  Informatics


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
The last publication was in 2010; however one has been submitted for publication in 2012. Since completing the PhD in 2000, there have been 10 manuscripts published in 13 years. There were 2 publications with co-authors in the last 17 years, all others were sole publications. 

The applicant has had one grant as PI for one year 2007-2008. Funding amount is not listed. Prior to obtaining the PhD, the applicant was co-investigator on one study in 1995 which does not list funding. 

Publications and research funding productivity appear to be underachieved for a candidate at the associate professor level with 13 years employment since obtaining the PhD. 

2.	Focused program of research
The stated research interests are in health information, specifically patient information needs and physician information needs. The applicant plans to extend their research agenda to examine the effectiveness of clinical informatics applications and the factors that influence use of consumer health informatics applications. The applicant has no grants listed since 2008, and that study was in recruitment/retention in health sciences librarianship at NC Central University. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
This candidate has a wealth of teaching experience and course development in informatics including courses designed for use in the discipline of nursing and informatics. The applicant has taught Health Information, Evidence Based Practice, Organization of Information, Research Methods, Quantitative Methods, and Capstone projects. The applicant has helped to develop a MS in Informatics/Nursing and Healthcare Informatics. The applicant is currently serving on 3 dissertation committees.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
The applicant is knowledgeable in clinical informatics and consumer health care informatics. The applicant is not a nurse.

5.	Service to the profession
The applicant has participated on may committees including focus in informatics, information retrieval, library science, accreditation, curriculum review, graduate studies, and faculty search committees at the university and department level. The applicant also participates on editorial review boards for Emporia State Research Studies, The Open Information Science Journal and Evidence Based Library and Information Practice Journals. 


6.	Job stability
The applicant has spent 4-6 years at two universities each, prior to the current position. The applicant has remained in the current position at Emporia State University for the last 17 months.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
The applicant is well qualified to contribute to teaching and program development in informatics at DUSON and to contribute to scholarly activities in collaboration with faculty colleagues and graduate students.

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
I think so: PhD awarded in 2011; she’s ahead of many new PhDs having been awarded a T23 and NIH Intramural award as a doctoral student and is completing a post-doc at Cornell.


2.	Focused program of research
Publications in brain biochemistry and use of photon microscopy are impressive; 5 published in past year, two submitted and one in the works. Not clear what program of research the candidate intends to pursue here at Duke. Has she identified people here (larger Duke) she’d like to work with? What support will she need for lab science?


3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Experience mostly teaching in physio lab which is quite different from the labs nursing students have. Taught an undergrad biology course (I assume this is classroom and lab) three times that may be comparable to teaching ABSN and graduate nursing students patho and pharm. Has had some experience with professional ed with pharm and veterinary students. Could not access the position description from the faculty candidate info database so I don’t even know if this is a teaching position or primarily a research position. 


4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Lab science experience as a doctoral student and post-doc; lots of RA positions that also look to be lab-related. These are all relevant to her expertise in lab science and teaching lab science skills.


5.	Service to the profession
Some evidence and probably fine for her career stage: presented at national science and teaching conferences; active in the American physiological society; reviewer for American Journal of Physiology


6.	Job stability
Appropriate to student and post-doc.


7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Mentoring PhD students focusing in physiologic research; as a member of the research team on projects that have physiologic components; teaching pathophysiology and parts of pharmacology.


Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Phone interview to get a better sense of her intent to continue a program of research in neuro-cardiac physio.</Comment>

<Comment>1. Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
	
	Limited to no research funding or publications

2. Focused program of research

None validated, but this is not unusual for a DNP; no mention of DNP capstone project

3. Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Hx of providing instruction mostly at the pre-licensure level (Western Carolina); evidence of some teaching at the graduate level (patho 3 credits &amp; clinical mgmt 1 credit). Has guest lectured for N334- Common GI Problems in Primary Care (online &amp; on campus)

4. Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Congruent with the role of NP, but appears limited and short term (averaging 2 years); specialty based, GI.

 5. Service to profession

Volunteer to the underserved (Transylvania Volunteers), NCNA (member), Council of NPs (NC), APRN Commission (NC), President Elect of Eta Psi Chapter of STT (Western Carolina)

6. Job stability

	Assistant Professor at WCU since 2010; clinical positions as above

7. Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Familiar with DUSON mission and goals as he was a DNP student here; practice as an NP still very limited. Would advise looking for a candidate with more clinical experience with diverse populations. Recommend not moving forward with an onsite visit at this time</Comment>

1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Currently has no research funding but is interested in interdisciplinary collaborative project in the area of utilization of accumulated nursing care data for secondary use (i.e. decision making). Limited publications outside of what appears to be dissertation, however she has just completed her post doc 12/10 and the majority of her informatics publications have been in 2012.


2.	Focused program of research
Does not currently have a funded program of research but is interested in the “design of a nursing-oriented clinical decision support system and for secondary usage of accumulated nursing care data that is crucial to decision making of nurses, beyond simply being documented and stored”. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has taught in Korea for approximately 4 years and is currently employed as an Assistant Professor in the SON Adelphi University since 1/2011. She states she has taught both undergraduate and graduate level courses, however it is unclear which courses and the length of time she has spent teaching undergraduate versus graduate levels. She has only been exposed to online teaching via experiences in her doctoral program.


4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Clinical practice was L&amp;D and Neonatal Intensive Care but it appears that she has not been in clinical practice since 1996 and has taken on the full time role as lecturer/professor/student from 1997-present. It is very unclear for me as to what she is currently teaching and the flow of the content taught prior to her doctorate education.

5.	Service to the profession
Has served as a peer reviewer for journal (informatics) and has membership in informatics organizations (all very recent)


6.	Job stability
She has demonstrated stability in her positions since her professorship in Korea. She then went to school in Chicago (there for about 5 years).


7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She is very junior in her positions and her teaching expertise is not quite clear. Her specified interests are not a match with Rachel or Constance but she did state she is open. Significant mentorship would be required.
	

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Feedback from Constance on applicant’s research interest.  Would not be against screening phone call to clarify teaching experience.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :  Ryan Shaw PhD, MS, BSN                                           			 Position:  Informatics

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Dr. Shaw is a postdoctoral research fellow with the Durham Veterans Affairs, Duke University Medical Center after graduating from his doctoral program at Duke University School of Nursing in 2012. He has 10 publications and 5 additional manuscripts under review which is quite prolific for his career stage. Dr. Shaw currently has postdoctoral funding and previously received a NRSA from NINR as well as CTSA funding for 2 years while a doctoral student. He shows excellent ability at early career stage to acquire research funding. 

2.	Focused program of research
Dr. Shaw’s research involves novel technologies to help people adhere to medical treatments regimens, self-manage chronic illness and maintain a healthy lifestyle. His previous research looked at a mobile device to help with weight loss. Currently he is using a commercially available online health portal to help post MI patients manage diabetes and their BP. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Dr. Shaw has very little teaching experience, most of which was gained through his doctoral program. He was a teaching associate in a BSN leadership class and has done several guest lectures in informatics and health promotion nursing classes. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Dr. Shaw practiced nursing for 4 years in adult health which adds clinical experience to his area of research. 

5.	Service to the profession
Dr. Shaw is an active member in the American Medical Informatics Association and reviews for three journals as an ad hoc reviewer. He has not held his first faculty position as of yet and has no faculty service experience. 

6.	Job stability
The applicant spent 4 years in a clinical position and then 4 years in doctoral education. He is currently in a postdoctoral position. There are no problems indicated with job stability. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
The applicant is well qualified as a junior faculty member in the area of informatics. He has a concentrated, yet young research trajectory. He has very little teaching experience but seems well qualified to develop in that area. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Continued recruitment if we are looking for a junior faculty member in informatics as opposed to a midlevel or senior faculty member in informatics.</Comment>

<Comment>1. Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Primary author x 1, secondary authorship x 2 in refereed journals; 1 manuscript in a non-refereed publication; 2 book chapters. Numerous posters &amp; abstracts; 0 research funding
	
2. Focused program of research

No focused program of research, although clinical practice has been mostly in inpatient endocrinology

3. Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Clinical Associate with DUSON since 2008. Many guest lectures on endocrinology to NP students; her lectures have been well received. Sought after interdisciplinary speaker at the regional, state, &amp; national level on endocrinology topics

4. Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Established clinician as an ACNP (11 years); most of her practice as an NP has been in inpatient endocrinology. Well respected in her field

 5. Service to profession

Long list of committee &amp; community involvement 

6. Job stability

Stable; NP with Duke Medicine since 2002

7. Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Have observed her lectures &amp; presentations; they are indeed very good. Very engaging presentation style. Overall a good match for DUSON, but I have a small concern in that she is an acute care nurse practitioner (with practice experience mostly with hospital based endocrinology patients). As I read the announcement, I believe we are looking for FNPs or Adult-Gero NPs with outpatient primary care experience. I recommend that Dr. Mabrey be brought in for a campus visit due to her reputation and her work as an ACNP, but maybe there is a better match with the ACNP program?</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
-	No funding noted on CV; states in letter that she has applied for grants and would like to conduct interdisciplinary research in informatics but no evidence on CV of success or submitted applications. 
-	Publications in line with career stage; however, noted that all of US pubs are in the journal for which she is a reviewer…..


2.	Focused program of research

-	Description of research program in her letter are pretty broad – nursing informatics/interdisciplinary research in nursing workflow; clinical decision making tools. This could be a fit here given the EMR issues and plans but not clear where exactly she want to go with this. What grants in these areas has she submitted?

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

-	From letter, it appears she has taught in introductory informatics course at grad level and an undergrad research course. She has not taught online but took many graduate online courses.
-	Speaks to desire to mentor grad students but no discussion of what she would be able to/like to teach.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
-	Has been in graduate school and there is no evidence that her clinical practice has continued.
-	Holds US RN license.


5.	Service to the profession
-	Member of professional organizations- no leadership roles
-	Reviewer for one nursing informatics journal

6.	Job stability
-	No issues noted- has been at Adelphi for two years (following completion of PhD).


7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
-	It appears that her informatics research could be a fit here at Duke but further discussion would be warranted.
-	It is not clear to me what she would be able to teach based on her CV/letter. Discuss with constance? 


Reviewer’s Recommendation:  


-	I would recommend a phone screen to explore questions above further IF Constance feels we should pursue her further. I wasn’t clear from her materials that she would fit what the needs are here.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Yes, very much so. Well-established record of funding at the pre- and postdoc level, awards from NIH and VA

2.	Focused program of research
Seems so, but applicant is young and may change focus as career develops. Interesting program addressing chronic health management using informatics technologies; may be good match for ADAPT center work

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Young in teaching, has good beginning ideas about teacher’s role, wants to be learner-centered which is a good focus for entering teaching.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Cardiothoracic unit and management experience; good experience in clinical informatics at VA and DUHS, I think.

5.	Service to the profession
	Not as strong here but he’s been busy as a student and postdoc. Presentation at conferences.
6.	Job stability
Looks OK; longest experience is 4 years as an IT fellow; 1-2 years at most in clinical positions


7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Informatics to manage chronic illness/symptoms may fit with ADAPT center? I don’t know what research is going on in informatics, maybe Constance Johnson’s work with virtual platforms for diabetes management?

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Phone interview for junior faculty position.  I was not able to access the position description from the database. This applicant is a good candidate for a junior position, but the Informatics III title sounds like more senior?</Comment>

Well qualified candidates will be certified as a family, geriatric or adult nurse practitioner and eligible for licensure as an advanced practice nurse in North Carolina.  Two to three years experience teaching at the graduate level and experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations is desirable.

Her teaching experience seems to fit the job requirements. She has taught in the Adult Geriatrics Nursing Program at UNC Greensboro. Courses taught relevant to this position as instructor or co-chair include: Care of Frail Elderly, Care of Older Adults, Primary Care of older Adults, and Introduction to Gerontology. Other courses taught include Health Assessment, Roles and Theory, and Fundamentals of Nursing.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: This area was not well articulated. She states in her cover letter that she has “cared for adults patients with greater emphasis on the elderly in the VA system, the Evercare model, outpatient clinics, group homes, long-term care and making housecalls.” This consulting position should be explored if candidate progresses to the telephone interview stage.

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Currently enrolled in a DNP program(Graduation May 2013). No first author publication and no clear indication of area of study for DNP. 

2.	Focused program of research
Area of interest is in cardiovascular risk reduction, diabetes and obesity prevention. Again, paperwork does not indicate exact nature of DNP.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
No undergraduate or graduate level teaching experience. Education experience limited to patient education, volunteer and clinical research.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
ANCC certified, adult nurse practitioner practicing since December 2002.  Managed patients in cardiology, endocrinology and rheumatology. Currently performing ANP duties of history, examinations and assisted with design, instructional training for clinical trials team.

5.	Service to the profession
Member of Sigma Theta Tau; volunteer instructor for the American Red Cross. Has presented at Grand Rounds at Duke Hospital

6.	Job stability
Employment history has been with Duke since 1996 in various areas but all in relation to the progression of her education. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Good clinical experience history although uncertain as to the clinical experience in the past 6 years. Current position seems to include obtaining medical history and physical exams however unsure of the frequency of patient contact.


Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

If basing soley on job description, this applicant should not progress to phone screen. While it seems she has good clinical experience and is in the process of completing DNP, she has no undergraduate or graduate level teaching experience. Progression to phone screen would depend on 1) if MSN program feels clinical practice is sufficient for postion and 2) if clinical practice is current and relevant for teaching needs. Phone screen may help in determining current clinical practice.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Applicant has been practicing as an NP and involved in research as a nurse-coordinator for many years. It is surprising, given the long history of involvement as a research coordinator, that she reports only 2 pubs.

2.	Focused program of research
No evidence; since this is a track 2 position, may not need research, but there is no evidence of any other scholarship, either

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
No teaching experience beyond providing information to research sites, client health teaching and standard programs like AHA and ARC CPR class instructor

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Excellent in this area; long history of clinical practice with adults in primary care in cardiology and rheumatology

5.	Service to the profession
No evidence of service; STTI member, unknown induction date; no other professional memberships listed, not a reviewer for any journals; has given only 4 presentations within the Duke and VA systems

6.	Job stability
No concerns here; 4-6 years in each main position

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Clinically relevant teaching but will need significant mentoring to make the shift from clinical inservicing to teaching students

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Candidate is strong on clinical practice, weak in all other areas. Further recruitment depends on the depth of the pool.</Comment>

<Comment>1. Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

No history of research funding per CV; (2) articles published in peer reviewed journals; (1) published abstract

2. Focused program of research

DNP (FNP) with focused area of practice in adult cardiovascular care; states a three year relationship with the &quot;Amarillo Heart Group Research Department.&quot; (2003- 2006).

3. Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Does not appear to have any didatic teaching experience; clinical preceptor experience in the late 1980s &amp; currently at NYU

4. Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Multiple clinical positions in cardiovascular health throughout this last decade (mostly office settings), tenure of three years or less at each location; most recent position as clinical coordinator for a heart failure program (since 2009)

5. Service to profession

Member of several national organizations (ANA &amp; ANCCN), Sigma Theta Tau; certified as a CCRN &amp; through ANCC (FNP); has presented at several conferences; has received several recognition awards.

6. Job stability

Multiple practice positions in the last 10 years; see #4

7. Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

FNP with a strong specialty practice in adult cardiovascular care (including heart failure &amp; lipid dysfunction). Academically well prepared with professional speaking experience. She would bring additional diversity to the faculty. This might be a good match, but we already have this content area covered by current faculty. States she has experience as an FNP involved with the primary care needs of the adult/gero population, but this would be somewhat limited in specialty practice. I have mixed feelings about bring her to campus because of this point. Little to no formal teaching experience per CV either in the classroom or on-line.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
-	She has over 70 publications, many of which she is first, senior or second author.
-	Grants – many NIH grants – two current R01’s and an R25. However, I noted that she is listed as a senior investigator on all the grants listed but never PI. 

2.	Focused program of research
Has a  unique program of research described as:  To analyze such complex topics as aging and common diseases I use an integrated approach and combine tools and concepts from human biology, genetics, gerontology, epidemiology and bio-demography.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term: Continue teaching at undergraduate and graduate level in adult care. Developing teaching skills. Want to continue practicing clinically
Long term : Incorporate more research, publications. Current school is more teaching focused does not have supportive structures in place. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Currently the majority of his teaching is within the ABSN program, however enjoys working master level courses and feels this is an area he would like to progress. He finds it very rewarding to work with graduate students 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
High caliber of students at Duke; enjoyed the graduate faculty during his time here as DNP student; feels it is important to be in a school such as Duke; #7 ranking and experienced this for 3 years; discussed with many of his professors and all enjoyed their job and benefits of working at DUSON.

4.	What are your strengths?
Very goal oriented and works hard to achieve; works well under stress and time constraints. Working with students; being understanding; serving as guide and mentor. Works with undergraduate and graduate and able to see the change in students from beginning to end. People skills; able to deal with conflict (obtained a great deal of these skills from clinical practice). Able to balance classes and give student satisfaction along with obtaining objectives

5.	What are your weaknesses?
There are often so many things of interest it is tempting to working on other little projects and divert from the original goal. 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Graduating with DNP from Duke [ DNP: Designed continuing education course for substance abuse (surveyed nursing schools in NC-most schools provide limited amount). Nursing students not learning how to work/communicate with patients who substance abusers). Current clinical practice area has increased numbers of patients who experience substance abuse. Publishing work in European Journal Science of Technology (Feb issue)].

Being a practicing clinician – earning patient respect and appreciation

7.	What is your teaching passion? Adult health, medsurg, critical care and pathophysiology
a.	Class size: Ideal 35-45 but does feel is can handle larger class sizes
b.	Clinical groups: Currently he experiences clinical group sizes as large as 12 but feels that 8-9 is more appropriate for learning
c.	Online: Is evolving and can provide real time interaction. Enjoys developing online classes and feel this is progressing towards synchronous work 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Predictors of success in Undergraduate Nursing Education and needs of the underserved population (especially age 62-65 population) who do not have insurance but clearly cannot work or have do not have disability

Feels it takes about 4 semesters to integrate into the school/courses which he would prefer before initiating research.

9.	What are your practice interests?
Primary care. Not sure what the future would be if he moves but main focus is primary care because he enjoys the variety within patient population.

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Service:  Enjoys community engagement. Involving the Student Association.  Very interested in educating rural youth to health care careers.  Being in the United Sates
Translating current teaching practice from ABSN to MSN: Feels they are very similar and feels his skills are transferable. This may be due to the fact that he teaches in an ABSN program and not traditional students; are much more mature.
Chair three committees MSN thesis and member of 3 three MSN thesis
Coordinator for Pathophysiology but is not for clinical management; currently teach in the ABSN program which is a 12 month program; intensive pace
Cardiology focus in graduate work but over the past two years he has worked in primary care with patient age range from 18-65
Committee member’s recommendation:
Alex is very focused on teaching which is good match for the position.  His teaching at the MSN level (coordinating) is limited but his clinical practice gives him a wide variety of experience in adult health. Progress to interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Some small grant funding attained for community health programs. 
No publications – few posters/abstracts.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
No – unclear what DNP work was – residency was listed which makes me think that her program required residency rather than QI/capstone? 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Earned a post – master’s certificate in nursing education in 2011
Has done adjunct teaching in master’s program in Virginia; educated practical nurses in the past at community college
Has done some online teaching in  current adjunct role


4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Over 17 years as FNP – has practiced in gero area 
Recent practice is to conduct home, clinic and assisted living facility visits. Has utilized telemedicine strategies and the home care component could be a good newer approach here too.
Has also done a lot in community health as NP and written grants to fund programs for the underserved

5.	Service to the profession
Has served as member or leader in local clinical or professional organizations

6.	Job stability
Has held multiple positions but no issues noted

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
-	Has relevant clinical experience/expertise and some innovative models of care
-	Has done some online teaching

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
I would recommend a phone screen. She is clinically qualified and appears to have relevant teaching experience. Not clear why the transition to a faculty role at this time. Hard to tell from CV whether she is a good ‘fit’ for DUSON.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
History of program funding; it looks like the same breast cancer early detection program was funded several years in a row; publications related to breast cancer screening program, not research data-based as far as I can tell.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Scholarship is focused on developing program for breast cancer screening

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has a recent post-masters certificate in nursing education but very little experience teaching graduate students – one class as “adjunct” faculty – and it is not clear from the CV how much responsibility she took for this class. Claims to have experience teaching on line and using technology in teaching but the extent of her experience seems limited especially with graduate students and I don’t think she has taught advanced practice nursing. Given her long history of NP practice, I am surprised she does not mention any students she has precepted.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Excellent clinical practice experience as an NP.

5.	Service to the profession
Unclear; I think most of what’s listed on the CV are workplace committees. Lists several memberships but no leadership.

6.	Job stability
Excellent

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Strong clinical practice experience in occupational health. Will need mentoring on teaching.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
do not pursue further recruitment. I don’t think she has the teaching experience to succeed on tract II.</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant: Melanie Mabrey, DNP, ACNP                                                   			 Position: Faculty, Adult/Gero NP
 
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

ST- to become more familiar with the NP curriculum &amp; advising process
LT- to develop more expertise as an NP educator; wants to utilize the essential elements learned as a DNP student, especially those that focus on translational science, in a pedagogical sense; desires to communicate the importance of this area at the master’s level

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)

Although has been responsible for creating in-service programs on inpatient diabetes management for physicians &amp; nurses and is a frequent lecturer on this &amp; similar topics (endocrine disorders) to our own NP students, she has never been employed as a FT educator

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  

DUSON is a ranked, well recognized national program. Wants to be a part of such an excellent community of clinical scholars; she has had a long term affiliation with Duke Health &amp; has developed a strong sense of loyalty/commitment. She wants to give something back to a system that she believes in very much.

4.	What are your strengths?

Detail oriented; can be very focused- desires to get the given task done. Compassionate, but knows how to give &amp; receive constructive criticism. Knows how to balance &amp; prioritize professional responsibilities. Feels like she is solid writer- her DNP capstone has been accepted for publication “Continuous IV Insulin in the Surgical Patient outside the ICU.”


5.	What are your weaknesses?

In spite of being able to prioritize responsibilities, sometimes has a hard time saying “no”

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?

Proudest moment is when Mark Feingloss, MD (Endocrine Clinic) told Kevin Sowers that he would rather have her (Melanie) take care of his patients in the hospital rather than many of his own residents &amp; fellows. 

Developed leadership at a relatively young professional age, while a nursing student at ECU, she was elected President of the NC Association of Nursing Students

In June of 2006, was invited by DUSON to represent the school during a consulting trip to Taiwan to help Taiwanese nurses develop a credentialing pathway for their NPs

7.	What is your teaching passion?

As above, past teaching experience has been mostly provider focused, has been responsible for the series “Management of Inpatient Diabetes Mellitus” for the DUHS for the last five years. Comfortable in teaching content devoted to chronic disease; has been a Clinical Instructor (currently assigned to N333), guest lecturer for endocrine content (thyroid dysfunction, obesity) in N334, &amp; diabetic pharmacology in N331

Passionate about preparing future generations of NPs &amp; how lifelong learning can contribute to nursing’s growing knowledge base

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?

Not particularly research but would like to develop a certificate program here at DUSON with a focus on diabetes management (3-4 week intensive with a clinical component, interdisciplinary in scope)

9.	What are your practice interests?

Credentialed as an Acute Care NP &amp; has always practiced in acute care settings (hospitals). Feels closer philosophically to the Adult NP role; does not see herself as a true ACNP in that her skillsets are not task oriented (central line insertions, vent management, chest tube insertions, managing codes), but rather centered in basics of general medicine/nursing. Most of her decision making involves engaging the patient in therapeutic conversations, i.e. “change talk.” 

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Is aware that she is an Acute NP with most practice experience almost exclusively in-patient wards; in spite of this, she feels comfortable with teaching chronic disease management in courses with a primary care focus. Believes she has unique professional experiences and skills that would bring certain richness to the informational exchange.

Committee member’s recommendation:
Melanie comes off quite strong in an interview situation. I would like to see her have a chance to explain her special qualities and her reasons why she would be an asset to the DUSON community to a wider audience. Recommendation: on-campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Conference presentations (poster/speaker) and recent published material are related to current post doctorate fellowship (2011) and PhD/dissertation in 2004. Received a grant from Sigma Theta Tau International and International Network of Doctoral Education of Nursing (INDEN) for post-doctorate training at Queensland University of Technology Brisbane, Australia. Has listed that she was associate investigator on several studies, however it is unclear to role, level of funding and funding source from the CV. It appears she is a very junior researcher with no significant funding.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Post Doctorate Fellowship: Pain and Fatigue in Chronic illnesses from the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), National Institutes of Health (NIH)
	Most research focus in the area of cancer pain (gender difference, relationship to spiritual beliefs)

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
No indication in CV on what level or courses taught (undergrad, masters, PhD) but has lecturer experience.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Last indicated clinical experience is one year of experience as registered nurse from 1995-1996 (immediately following graduation from BSN). Unclear if she has current clinical practice. MSN is listed as Critical Care (assuming that is NP) but no practice indicated in employment history.

5.	Service to the profession
Serves as secretary for steering board to develop Thailand STT Chapter

6.	Job stability
This area is very stable.  Majority of time (1996-2011) spent as lecturer and scientist at Chiang Mai University in Thailand. Last two recent positions are post-doctorate fellowships.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
There is not a match between candidate and current Senior Researcher job description. She is very junior and indicates her next intentions are to seek a K award for career development. She may be a candidate for Jr. Researcher but requires significantly more development in research career to meet the criteria of this job description.

<Comment>I agree with other reviewer that this candidate does not meet the criteria for &quot;Senior Researcher&quot; in terms of career stage. She is finishing post doctoral NINR fellowship and has research interests in fatigue and symptom management in cancer that fit with those here at DUSON. However, she has not achieved a level of major independent funding or publications to be at more than the Assistant level here and therefore would not be able to mentor other junior faculty and doesn&apos;t have large funding. Therefore, I agree we should not pursue this candidate for the position.</Comment>

With respect to past funding, she was PI on two NIH/NINR proposals and several as PI from other funding sources that are appear more as institutional funding (e.g., faculty development awards, academic senate award, alumni funds). In general, her research funding and publication record is appropriate for the stage of her career. 

2.	Focused program of research. Dr. Kennedy’s recent research interest – as expressed in the cover letter – is to develop mobile phone applications for low health literacy patients in primary care settings. In addition, her research interests include: 1) factors the influence risk taking behaviors in younger children, especially in different racial populations (e.g., Hispanic); 2) the bidirectionality between parental risk factors (e.g., stress, health seeking behaviors, sedentary behaviors, fatigue) and child health risk behaviors; and 3) ways to increase physical activity in parents and children through, for example, gaming technologies. A common theme in these research endeavors is the use of technological devises to promote change.    

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs. As stated in her CV, Dr. Kennedy has mentored 33 Ph.D. students through qualifying exams and/or dissertation – the focus of several dissertations were on children’s health often in the context of various disparities (e.g., race, income). Many of these students have research/academic positions. Courses she has taught at the Masters and Ph.D. levels were on such topics as infant and child development, advanced child and developmental science, human health and nursing systems, and parent and child nursing. The typical class size was between 20 to 30 students. No teaching evaluations were provided.  

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice. Dr. Kennedy has a California Registered Nurse License. From 1994 to 2010, she provided consultation on pediatric behavior issues to faculty and students at the now renamed Valencia Health Service Clinic. This clinic served as a training ground for faculty and Master NP students in pediatric primary care and to facilitate doctoral research involving Latino populations. She also served from 2006-2007 as a clinical consultant utilizing translational research and best practice approaches for implementing health behavior change with the primary care visit model. She has helped to establish as interdisciplinary team to provide health coaching for lifestyle changes, primarily physical activity. 

5.	Service to the profession. She was or is a member of several professional organizations, such as the Academy of Nursing, Society of Behavioral Medicine, Academic Pediatric Association, etc. She has/is serving as a reviewer for journals and served on several editorial boards. Her contributions to the SON, campus, and school of medicine are numerous. Of import, some of her service work as a consultant has been in the areas of pediatrics with agencies outside of the U.S. (e.g., India, Hong Kong).   

6.	Job stability. Dr. Kennedy has been with University of California, San Francisco, since 1991. 


7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Dr. Kennedy can contribute to both teaching and research in the area of pediatrics. Her interest in the use technologies that cover E-Health and M-health would be of interest to several faculty including those in the area of informatics. Her work with different racial populations and investigations into issues of disparities would be of interest to those faculty and students who do research in disparities and community health promotion activities. Some of her interests (e.g., promoting physical activity) cover areas of disease prevention; such an addition should be welcomed to the DUSON. Given her interaction overseas, she can assist with the DUSON efforts to establish teaching and research efforts aboard (e.g., China).

<Comment>From telephone interview. Isaac Lipkus and I interviewed the candidate together. We have written up our impressions separately. Mine is as follows- I have mostly written down her direct answers:
Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:     Christine Kennedy                                               		Position: Senior Researcher 
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Dr. Kennedy said she is in the last 1/3rd of her career and has already accomplished most her goals for research. She would like to transfer her research operation and obtain funding through industry or PCORI. She would like to build a research team, establish connections and go for funding. She would like to remain in peds primary care area and can contribute in the developmental childhood area. She greatly enjoys mentoring masters and doctoral students. 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She has had a happy and successful time at UCSF. The first reason she would like to leave is that “DUSON is growing rather than downsizing, Duke is creating programs, she knows Kathy and has watched her career.” Also, “UCSF has dwindled and is unable to support state and public education which has impacted the SON. The school is struggling to keep mounting expensive programs with resources not in place and is not fostering innovation.” She feels that UCSF SON is on a downward trajectory so she would like to reassess where to do the rest of her career. Naturallly, she “wanted to look at the east coast because she was from this area.”
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She is interested in DUSON because it is growing and there is potential for collaboration in research. Duke has multiscience schools such as engineering and cognitive science, so that appeals to her. She feels there is potential for inhouse collaboration also. 
4.	What are your strengths?
Her strength is “in communication. She is relaxed and has high standards, and integrity.” She feels she can make  a solid contribution in many domains in nursing. 
5.	What are your weaknesses?
One weakness is “typing numbers.” She said this because she gave us the wrong phone number for the interview and we had a bit of trouble reaching her. She states she is not as assertive as she could be. She also states that rejection is difficult. One challenging thing for her is juggling things.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her most significant accomplishment is “receiving the endowed chair in pediatrics which is reflective of overall career accomplishment.” Secondly her work with doctoral students is an accomplishment. 
7.	What is your teaching passion? (We did not get to this question as we were running out of time)
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Her research interests are “children’s health behaviors and how illness influences health and behaviors on a day to day basis.” She is also interested in “cultural and ethnicity influences on behavior focusing in the area of television.” She is currently interested in “physical activity and obesity; looking at solutions to decrease sedentary behavior, in the Hispanic population.” She is currently working on a “mobile phone app to increase physical activity.” She will apply for a PCORI grant which she feels is better than the NIH and an RO1 to fund this research. “Her R01 will not get funded as it did not have a fundable score.” 
9.	What are your practice interests?
Currently, she does not practice and has no plans to renew her peds primary certification. She has been doing consulting work over the last few years in the area of peds primary care. 
10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Committee member’s recommendation:
She does not seem to be a good match for DUSON for the senior researcher position and my recommendation is to cease further consideration. RBK</Comment>

										CONFIDENTIAL
Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:    Dr. Christine Kennedy                                              Position:  Senior Researcher
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? Is on the last 1/3rd of her career. Short term, she wants to transfer her research operation to a new location (e.g., find new research team).  Short to longer term she wants to apply for grants.  She wants to continue to teach and mentor graduate students – which she thoroughly enjoys.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Not a great sense of clarify. Primarily, she wants to go to a place that is growing, which is unlike what is happening at her institution. She is also from the East coast, which is not a major reason.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Again, because of the growth of DUSON, under the leadership of Dr. Gilliss. She believes that at the university level there are several departments that she can collaborate with, such as engineering and cognitive sciences.  Specific to DUSON, she finds a cadre of faculty who are doing good research and teaching.  It was peculiar that when she began to respond to this question, she qualified her remarks based on her “distant assessment.”  Thus, not clear whether she spent a lot of time researching the university. 


4.	What are your strengths? From a personality perspective, she is: 1) a good communicator, 2) relaxed, 3) has high standards for herself and others (e.g., students), 4) easy to get along with, 5) flexible, and 6) a team player. From a professional standpoint, she is well balanced, that is she has a well- rounded background in teach (“master teacher”), clinical practice (e.g., primary care settings)  – though not actively practicing now, and research. 

5.	What are your weaknesses? Not assertive at times speaking her mind. Continues to find rejection difficult to take. Has at times juggling the many day-to-day activities.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?  Receiving the endowed chair position at her institution. Personally, she feels her greatest accomplishments are working with doctoral students.

7.	What is your teaching passion? (question not asked due to time constraints)
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans? Has three main interests: 1) how illness influence children’s health behaviors; 2) how culture and ethnicity influence health behaviors – brought up the issue of the media, and 3) exploring factors that influence physical activity, especially sedentary behaviors (e.g., fatigue, men’s role). Would like to expand her work using M-health technology and apply them to dyads that involve both the child and the parents.  Her recent R01 application will not receive funding. She has a couple of small grants.  She wanted to know whether anyone had an interest in submitting a P30 application using technologies. 

9.	What are your practice interests? No discussed due to time limitations.

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Committee member’s recommendation:  I am ambivalent about bringing her in for an interview.  I think she could play a role in the conduct of research pertaining to preventive behaviors with children, as well as teaching courses and mentoring graduate students with interests in child health. She may also fit well with informatics. She seems to be an excellent mentor.  She does not bring in a lot of resources.  Seems she wants to go to an environment that is growing.  I am also not clear how many more years she would want as a faculty member given that she is at the last “1/3rd” of her career. I would suggest the full committee discuss this applicant.</Comment>

Applicant:         Donna Biederman, DrPH, MN, RN                            Position:  Community Health

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term:   Become more confident as a faculty member; continue teaching in Community Health.  After an initial focus on teaching, she would eventually like to engage nursing students in community research.
Long term:     Progress program of research which would be strongly driven by the research needs of the community partners.  

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Currently the scope of her position does not utilize all of her skills and potential. The faculty position would provide room for growth and allow her to contribute to the faculty and to DUSON. Would like to be involved in decision making processes and in current role she does not have the ability to contribute to improvement/change (non-voting). 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Before her first position with DUSON, she reviewed the mission, value and goals of the DUSON and felt that they embodied her values. She also attended the CI intensive and Radical Transformation and truly felt that DUSON lived the mission statement and was not just words. She has developed substantial relationships with faculty and is excited about the CPI process.

4.	What are your strengths?
Strong work ethic and carries share of workload; good understanding of research and the research process. She has a strong background that demonstrates previous involvement not only in the research process but also in organizational change (she participated/led 15 implementation groups {109 staff members in her department} through organizational change).

5.	What are your weaknesses?
Although she currently teaches N243 with Dr. Hartman she considers herself a novice in nursing education and needs to increase knowledge of nursing education (although working in the CND has broadened knowledge in many areas). She has no experience in online teaching. 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Donna is from an extremely rural area and is a first generation high school graduate (neither parent graduated from high school). She is also a first generation college graduate (undergraduate) in her entire family. College was not in family conversation.  To be able to complete her doctoral degree and transition into professional role is her most significant accomplishment. 

7.	What is your teaching passion?
Community health, health disparities and health promotion. Would like to teach at the ABSN and MSN level.
A.	Class size – Prefers approximately 36-40 students. This allows for great diversity of thought, easier to break down into groups and faculty are not overwhelmed with grading assignments. However, she is aware of the number of students per ABSN cohort.
B.	Clinical groups  -  Provides her an opportunity to individualize education and bond; current assignments do not allow for large groups of students (6-10). She understands that she will continue to serve in the CI role as Community Health faculty.
C.	Online – Novice in this area and prefers the face to face encounter because she feels she is more effective in that venue, however very open to the idea. Online does allows one the opportunity to be creative. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Primary research interest is in the area of homelessness and health disparities.
Her research plans will be in concert with community partners to fulfill their research needs. She would like to continue encourage student participation in the research process. Wants to contribute to nursing education literature through community health (example: students evaluating a community partners program). She currently has 3 abstracts accepted to present at the Association of Community Health Nurse Educator in June and has two abstracts pending for the American Public Health conference.  
She feels strongly about telling our community partners story through research and manuscripts. She considers one of her strengths to be qualitative research and would like to collaborate with other faculty members in the area of health disparities (i.e. OGACHI, MADIN II) and possibly comparing outcomes of local and abroad opportunities for students for differences.

9.	What are your practice interests?
Community health; not in clinical practice at this time but is still certified.

N/A
5.	Service to the profession
Served as member on Durham VA IRB for 4 years ending 2012; mentored graduate (9) and undergrad students (7) over the past 4 years; and has served on one internal and external committee. Reviews for multiple journals

6.	Job stability
Received PhD in 2002 and since starting her post doc at the VA after graduation, has maintained positions either at Duke Department of Medicine or the VA.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Teaching in research related topics across programs. Good record of research with good potential for additional funding. Potential for innovative work with Marilyn Lombardi. Nursing expertise is not evident however the program of research is of relevance to nursing practice. Much of her work is physician-patient communication however this can be translated across providers.  

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

The applicant is between junior and senior nurse researcher. No notable teaching experience and research career is definitely progressing but uncertain of her role in these studies. Minimal PI roles and very unsure of what her role research mentoring role has included for students. She is progressing well but seems that she would require mentoring and not sure she fully fits the senior nurse researcher. Would not be opposed to clarify these questions with a phone screen.</Comment>

Sharron,

Dr. Demby originally submitted application materials without indicating a position; I responded that the committee reviews applications in light of a specific opening and asked her to review the announcements posted and indicate which position she&apos;d like to be considered for.    Her reply is below - I assume she&apos;s referring to the senior researcher position?   Her CV is attached - it looks like she&apos;s a nurse but there does not appear to any grant funding, publications/scholarship history, and only some teaching?  To save the committee a little work, if you agree that she does not meet the qualifications for senior researcher, I could send her a regret letter.

Thanks.

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Recently completed DNP and has a few data-based pubs but no research or project funding; it appears most of applicant’s focus has been on clinical practice in primary care and population/public health in which she has quite an impressive list of accomplishments

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
clinical practice has a clear focus in family/childrens health, population focused, public health but no program of research as such

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
No evidence on CV of experience teaching in graduate programs, little experience teaching in ADN and, I think, BSN program. Has taught community health but maybe not specifically public health or population health or epidemiology and not at graduate level

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Excellent, this is cleary where she has focused her attention and effort, extensive clinical practice experience in childrens and womens health in primary care and public health, experience establishing and directing programs in these areas.

5.	Service to the profession
No evidence of service outside clinical practice.

6.	Job stability
excellent

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I think there are probably others she can connect with on projects and research.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

It’s hard to tell from the CV if candidate has a developed program of scholarship per se. Based on her clinical experience including program planning and evaluation, I recommend phone interview.</Comment>

No evidence of any program of research. Scholarship seems to take the form of grant development

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
The CV does not give a clear picture of clinical practice as such; consulting and advising seems to be the main focus rather than clinic or public health program work.

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Stewart Alexander                                          Position:  Senior Researcher


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Alexander has 41 peer reviewed journal publications, as well as 42 conference presentations. He is currently involved with 8 ongoing grants, none of which he is PI. He was involved in 12 prior grant funded projects.

2.	Focused program of research. His program of research is focused heavily on communication processes, especially those that focus on provider-patient exchanges involving lifestyle changes and medical decision-making. He has extensive experience developing and applying coding methods to analyze patient-provider communication. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  He has very limited experience teaching. Most recently, at High Point he has taught a mixed methods course and has been asked to teach in the Fall a course on qualitative methods. Between 1994 and 2001, he has taught courses on small group communication, interpersonal communication, and introduction to public speaking. Overall, there were no data on course evaluations, but in the section on professional awards and special recognitions, it does appear he has received excellent teaching evaluations.  There is no history of mentoring junior faculty, but has mentored 16 students, on which about ½ where graduate students.  

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   No relevant clinic practice noted.   

5.	Service to the profession.  He is a member of the National Communication Association and the American Academy on Communication in HealthCare.  He has or is serving as a reviewer for numerous (N=10) journals, such as Academic Medicine, Family Medicine, Preventive Medicine and Psycho-Oncology. 

6.	Job stability:  From 2002 until present, he has held position either at the Durham VAMA or at Duke University Medical Center. He lists as being an Assistant Research Professor at DUSON.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  As noted on his cover letter, Dr. Alexander can teach a variety of courses, including research methods, mixed methods, qualitative analyses, and various courses on communication. He would add substantial strength to areas of communication notably missing from DUSON, such as patient-provider communication. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr. Steward is a very promising scholar with a strong enthusiasm for teaching and research. However, he lacks experience obtaining grants as a PI and very limited, if any, teaching/mentoring experience of nursing students. As such, he may be too junior for this position – although with some mentoring, he may become a very accomplished senior researcher.  He would clearly add strength to processes of communication in clinical care and public health, and can teach courses that are of interest to students (e.g., mixed methods). I would recommend a follow-up phone call.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :            Elizabeth Kimball Todd Rende                         			 Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Completed DNP at DUSON in 2012 but has not extended productivity beyond capstone (which is not unusual). Has presented consistently in conferences or symposiums but has no other notable publication productivity (1 article in 2010 (2nd author)). 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Area of interest is headache disorders/chronic headaches in pediatric population 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Taught RN-BSN online for 7 years and has been a preceptor for DUSON FNP program. Taught/co-taught Child Health in Family Care course  for 3 semesters. It is unclear of her role in this course from 2003-2012 as adjunct faculty and presenter/not certain if this is the period she co-taught.  Presents pediatric neurology topics for PNP program.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Currently serves as a provider in the Duke Pediatric Neurology Headache Clinic. Serves as preceptor for the FNP and PNP program. 

5.	Service to the profession
Member of NAPNAP. No further evidence of current service

6.	Job stability
Has demonstrated good stability in roles. Has been in the Duke system since 1997 as clinical nurse and upon graduating  PNP program, moved to current position in the Pediatric Neurology Headache Clinic. Has taught online for Phoenix for 7 years and with Duke as Adjunct faculty (preceptor) since 2010.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Is a preceptor for DUSON in the FNP program and understands the needs of the students in the clinical setting. Has working relationship with Dr. Blood-Siegfried and Dr. Lorimer.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

The teaching experience of this candidate does not meet the criteria of the position. She has a role in the Child Health in Family Care course in the FNP program but her teaching experience seems to be restricted to pediatrics. There is no evidence to support that her knowledge base and teaching experiences extends beyond her pediatric/pediatric neurology content. Also, this position requires some evidence of a developing program of scholarship. The candidate mentions that there is continued enrollment in her capstone project, however beyond that information there is no evidence scholarship.

I would recommend regret letter.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
The applicant has 5 peer reviewed publications, with a clinical focus. There is no research funding reported. The productivity is appropriate in that she has not been in a tenure track position and has mostly worked in clinical positions.

2.	Focused program of research
There is no focused area of research noted. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
The applicant has no evidence of teaching experience in her CV. She lists 1 year as an instructor in a ADN program; however, she also writes that she worked as an FNP in that position. She did not list any courses taught. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has a vast amount of clinical experience as a FNP, woman’s health, and school aged practitioner. I do not see education for her original RN licensure- and am not sure if it was through a diploma or AND program as it is not listed; however, she is licensed as an RN. 

5.	Service to the profession
There is no indication of service to the profession. 

6.	Job stability
The applicant appears to have had job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
The applicant has strong clinical experience. She has very little to no teaching experience, which the position needs. She also has no indication of experience with program evaluation, which is desirable for this position. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
I suggest a telephone interview to explore any teaching experience that is not indicated and any experience with program evaluation. From the CV, the candidate is not a good fit for the position, but there is a possibility that the CV is not complete.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :     Kathryn Evans                                	 				Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage. She has no publications. With respect to research funding, she lists being on five ongoing projects. Two are NIH funded projects, one on hypertension and one on glycemic control. She is working on a DNP capstone project -- she is a DNP student who is expected to graduate in December, 2013. She also listed two other research projects, one on nutrition and one on Tadalafil and Gastric emptying. 

2.	Focused program of research. In the cover letter, three areas of research interests are diabetes, hypertension and thyroid disease. However, none of these areas are elaborated upon.   

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  According to the job ad, “Two to three years experience teaching at the graduate level and experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations are desirable.” It does not appear that Ms. Evans has thought graduate level courses. Her CV does mention that she has taught residents, fellows, and students on inpatient teaching services. However, her teaching experience is not elaborated upon. Thus, is seems questionnale whether she has the desirable level of teaching experience.    

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice.  From 2008 until the present, she has worked as an NP for both inpatient/outpatient care in the Duke University Medical Center’s Division of Endocrinology. During 2007, she had two NP internships, one in internal medicine (Shands Medical Group, FL) and in ambulatory care (Marion County Health Department, FL). From 2006-2008, she was an RN on a medical-surgical unit.  

5.	Service to the profession. She is a member to three professional organizations, American Nursing Association, American Association of Nurse Practioners, and NC Nurses Association. 

6.	Job stability. During the last five years, she has health positions within the Duke University Medical Center in the Division of Endocrinology.  In general, she shows job stability. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Able to contribute in the area of endocrinology with some background in women’s health, pediatrics, geriatric medicine and adult health. Could help with DNP student capstone projects. May be able to help teach research methods given her current work in research.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  In the cover letter, she states that she seeks a “position within the school of nursing that would allow me to continue practicing with the division of Endocrinology while partnering with the school of nursing.” Therefore, it seems that she is not pursuing the advertised DNP position as a full-time commitment. The latter, combined with her lack of teaching experience make me recommend no phone follow-up.</Comment>

-	Has chaired honors’ theses and been on DNP committees in current role

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
-	Current practicing FNP – since 2005 with focus on children and adolescents
-	Position prior to this one was working with adults primarily chronic illness management
-	Both experiences very relevant to this position

5.	Service to the profession
-	Member of many national/international professional groups
-	On many university and nursing school committees

<Comment>Applicant :      Molly Rothmeyer                                             			 Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No research funding or publications noted.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
DNP is focused on reducing head CT in pediatric head trauma patients. No other scholarship or research noted.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Stated in cover letter that she has lecture experience, however none noted on CV. From the information on the cover letter it appears she has more experience in precepting nursing students but not formal classroom experience. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has had FNP experience in a variety of settings including emergency department, US Army training center (urgent care), pediatric primary care office. It is unclear where these experiences were located.

5.	Service to the profession
None noted.

6.	Job stability
It is a little unclear on her CV where she has been during certain time periods as she did not put a place but work experience. This would require clarification.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Holds certifications as FNP-BC and will soon complete PNP-AC. Has a variety of clinical experiences ranging across the spectrum (excluding geriatrics).

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

Although she has a great deal of clinical experience, there is no documented undergraduate or graduate level teaching experience. This candidate would most likely require significant mentoring. Recommend regret letter.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Andreea Toader, DNP, MSN, RN                         Position:   Applied for two positions: Community Health and Health Care Population  Coordination

 
Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Toader has one publication in a peer reviewed journal (Journal of Community Mental Health Nursing). There does not seem to be any presentations given at conferences or elsewhere. In the cover letter, it specifies that she has “also participated in the grant-writing and data collection of our SAMHSA grant-funded program to provide integrated health services to our uninsured, under-insured, and homeless clients in our community.”

2.	Focused program of research. Not exactly clear. It appears that her scholarly interests pertain to mental health nursing (e.g., screening for diabetes in schizophrenia).  

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  Very vague. She specifies in her cover letter that she taught “both didactic and lecture type courses as well as clinical courses in various health care facilities in the area for undergraduate and the RN and BSN program.” Listing of these courses and teaching evaluations are not provided. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   She has served as an impatient surgical nurse for about a year at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, then as a nurse case manager for close to two years at the Washtenaw County, Community Support and Treatment Services, and has apparently been promoted to the Nursing Services during 2013. As a nurse case manager, she worked with patients with severe psychiatric disabilities and their families to address, for example, patient and family needs (e.g., coordination, management and self-care, report of health status). In her present position, she supervises and coordinates the activities of nursing staff in the delivery of services while supporting the application and adherence to evidenced based best practices.  She is licensed (RN) in NC.  

5.	Service to the profession.  Dr. Toader is Chair, of the Medication Management Committee of the Washtenaw County Community Mental Health and Washtenaw County Public Health Department. She is also the Co-Chair of the Infection Control Committee, Washtenaw County Community Mental Health and Washtenaw County Public Health Department. There is no evidence service to a professional organization or serving as a grant or journal reviewer. 

6.	Job stability:  From July 2010 until the present, she has worked at the Washtenaw County Community Support and Treatment Services. It is important to note that she recently graduated with a DNP (April 2013) and obtained an MSN (2011) and BSN (2009). She is currently a faculty member at the Eastern Michigan’s University School of Nursing – length of time unspecified. In sum, during her short career, she has managed job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Toader can help with the teaching of mental health nursing.  The teaching responsibilities for the community health position calls for “didactic and clinical instruction in the community health nursing course and didactic/seminar instruction in the health promotion/disease prevention course.” It appears that she has taught a course or more relevant to this position, but it is left unspecified. With respect to the population coordination position, the candidate should have experience in nursing education experience with program evaluation and also have a developed program of scholarship. She seems to have elements of these but are left vague. For example, while she plays a role in the implementation of evidence based practices, it is unclear to what extent she does program evaluations. I would not say she has a developed program of scholarship.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr. Toader it at the very early stages of her career. She does seem to possess elements that are needed for both positions – a potential positive. However, the lack of detail in her application precludes any clear indication of which position she is most suited for.   At the very minimum, I would suggest a phone interview to clarify these issues – although I am also sympathetic to the notion of not having a follow-up intervview if someone does not bother to provide more details.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Not much funding and few data-based pubs. More pubs and presentations related to teaching innovations; one project funded by NLN on predicting success of nursing students

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
The focus is on the scholarship of teaching and learning rather than research; any more specific focus is hard to discern from the CV – liberal arts, older adults, nursing students’ success are all areas

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Very good experience teaching community health and as full faculty member at UNCG. Experience on various academic committees including curriculum committee, student advising, organizing large courses

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
No evidence of clinical practice from the CV

5.	Service to the profession
Some, no real leadership in professional orgs

6.	Job stability
Good

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I think she would be ready to take on full teaching load and contribute to teaching/learning innovaiton


Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Phone interview if we’re serious about recruiting to this position.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
-	Completing DNP May 2013 (need to confirm this!)
-	No publications
-	no research funding which is consistent with clinical focus.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
-	Not clear – does not mention capstone project for her DNP or any other form of clinical scholarship involvement 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
-	Currently adjunct faculty here at Duke in both on campus and online classes – physical assessment, pharm, and other NP courses. Also clinical instructor.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
-	Has a lot of relevant practice experience- urgent care, occupational health; and pediatrics

5.	Service to the profession
-	None mentioned or on CV

6.	Job stability
-	No concerns noted

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
-	Practice experience and her adjunct teaching are a good fit for the position. However, I’m concerned about lack of clinical scholarship; and need to confirm DNP degree completed this year. 


Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
If she was an ‘outside applicant’ I would recommend not pursuing but since she is adjunct here and has relevant practice/adjunct teaching and was refered to apply by Michael Z., I think we’d have to do a phone screen and explore questions as to her confirmed graduation with DNP and her lack of any scholarship.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :           Kathryn Evans                                        			 Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
She is scheduled to graduate from DNP program in December, has no publication productivity at this point and is currently sub or co-investigator 5 studies, including 2 NIH studies and 2 DUMC studies.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Per her cover letter, areas of interest include translational nursing research with focus on chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension, thyroid diseases). Uncertain of the DNP focus.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
No teaching experience noted at the graduate level. Exposure seems limited to in-services and lectures to medical students or journal clubs. It seems from the cover letter that teaching is a goal for her which is why she is integrating some educational courses into her DNP program. This is not congruent with the needs of the position.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has practiced at Duke Endocrinology since graduation from Internship and performs a great deal of clinical teaching. From the clinical knowledge aspect, I believe this is where she could have a large contribution to the program.

5.	Service to the profession
Affiliated with ANA and AANP organizations (appears as member/not certain). Volunteers with the Samaritan Health Center and provides care for Durham Rescue Mission residents.

6.	Job stability
Has been in current position at Duke since graduation in 2008. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Appears to have a strong clinical teaching background and has participated in clinical trials research.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

No significant graduate level teaching experience to meet the level of the requirements of the position. I recommend a regret letter, however, if there is a desire to create future faculty for the position I feel she has potential and can be used as clinical preceptor and part time teaching to get her up to the level of the position.</Comment>

Applicant :    Jannyse Starks                                               			 Position:  Family Nurse Practitioner


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
The applicant has no research funding or publications. She is very early in her career and has not held an academic appointment other than adjunct faculty.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
She conducted her DNP project around hypertension in African Americans. It is not published.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has experience precepting NPs in two college programs as adjunct faculty. She does not have any experience teaching courses other than clinical and online clinical as a preceptor. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
The applicant was an LPN 2006-2007. She obtained a MSN as a FNP in 2009 and her RN license through that program in 2008. She does not have an undergraduate nursing degree. She practiced as a nursing supervisor from 2008-2010 in a rehab center where she was responsible for patient and family grievances. She entered a DNP program in 2009 and finished in 2011. She worked in 3 walk in clinics as a FNP from 2010-present. 

5.	Service to the profession
No service indicated. 

6.	Job stability
She has been involved in 3 walk in clinics, some simultaneously, and 2 colleges as adjunct faculty in the last 3 years. Job stability is questionable. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I believe this candidate has too little clinical experience as a FNP and very little teaching experience; therefore, I do not think this candidate is a good match for DUSON and this position.

Applicant :     Tina M. D’Alessandro	 				Position:  Psych NP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  She has two peer reviewed publications in Pediatric Nursing and three refereed posters. She has three other, what seem to be, non-peer reviewed publications. She has three invited presentations.  

2.	Focused program of research.  No focused program of research was stated.    Based on her publications, her interest seems to reside with children with autism. Appears to have done some research in an oncology setting, but no details are provided. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  No specific information was provided. In her cover letter, she specifies having served as a preceptor to both family practice nurse practitioner students and psychiatric nurse practitioner students. She has also taught nursing students health assessment during a two week international experience.  

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice.  From 2007 until the present, she has worked as a psychiatric nurse practitioner. The responsibilities include the diagnosis of and treatment of mental health disorders in children, medication management, and individual and family counseling in both impatient and partial hospital settings. Similarly, from 1992 through 2000, she has worked in adolescent psychiatry. Other roles she has served have been in primary care-family practice, ICU, and on an oncology research unit. 

5.	Service to the profession. She is a member to six professional organizations. She has done a variety of service tasks at the University of Florida (preceptor role), and working with children.  No evidence of being a journal or grant reviewer.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Can teach mental health nursing. Can contribute to research involving youth. In the ad for the position, it states that it would be desirable, to have two to three years of experience teaching at the graduate level and experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations.” It is not clear that she has this relevant experience. She seems to have some experience doing brief teaching/clinical stints in other countries (e.g,. Cambodia, Moldova).

1. Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

DUSON DNP grad (2012) with limited scholarly activity beyond original capstone

2. Focused program of research

Headaches in pediatric populations

3. Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

RN completion track- online experience x 7 years. Has delivered lectures (pediatric neuro content) in N441; known to both Jane Blood-Siegfried &amp; Marcia Lorimer. Has precepted DUSON FNP &amp; PNP students

4. Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Duke Pediatric Neurology/Headache Clinic

5. Service to profession

NAPNAP

6. Job stability

Has been in the Duke system since 1997; practice placement appears to be steady. Has taught online for Phoenix and as an adjunct for DUSON NP programs


7. Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Knows DUSON culture &amp; expectations; has working relationships with some of the NP faculty

Recommendation:

Somewhat concerned regarding her practice experience being restricted to pediatric neuro, in particular, headache disorders. First level of review finds her to be very skilled and competent within a highly specialized area. The NP position in the FNP program may require a broader scope. Her scholarship is indeed limited at this point, but this is not unusual for a clinic heavy DNP. Can discuss with the group, but would not recommend progression at this point.</Comment>

<Comment>Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:   Jill Kerr                                                 			 Position:  HCPC
These answers are mainly direct quotes from applicant. 

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Her primary goal is to pay back the nurse faculty loan program- so she needs to teach. Her longer term goal is to be a clinician and nurse faculty. She would ideally like a 85% faculty position, 15% clinician position, in order to keep her FNP certification. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She is not currently in a faculty position as her CV states. She said she worked in Elizabeth City, NC and taught 3 semesters, and lives in Carrboro and her husband has Parkinson’s disease. She resigned her faculty role last December to get her house in order. She is currently an associate editor of a book, AAP Textbook of Pediatric Care, so that is what she is doing now. (I looked the book up but can only see the editors names which does not include hers).

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She is interested in this position because the person would report to Barbara Turner and she likes her. She said it is the first population position and feels Duke is mostly clinically oriented so she would like to help bring a population focus. 

4.	What are your strengths?
She has been a clinician for 30 years. She has worked in multiple settings. She is fluent in Spanish, and she has expertise in maternal and child health. She has a strong background in statistics and she is connected to public health at UNC. She is a good teacher. 

5.	What are your weaknesses?
She hasn’t taught online before and would need mentoring. She did not grow up with technology and feels teaching online may be challenging. 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Obtaining her DNP. Remaining clinically active as an FNP for 30 years. She launched a major project to establish prenatal care in Southern New Mexico. She worked for Headstart  for 8 years which had an impact on children. 

7.	What is your teaching passion? Her teaching passion is maternal and child health. She said she is obsessed with young kids. She said she is an “edutainer” and likes the challenge of imparting information using teaching methods like Myers Brigss etc. She doesn’t care if she teaches in person or online or clinical versus didactic, but says she could not teach in the FNP course things like physical assessment- it’s not her thing. 
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Her main interests are writing chapters. She has clinical interests in pediatric clinics. She is also interested in maternal depression and its effect on children, home visitation, and school health. She loves statistics. 

9.	What are your practice interests?
She is interested in practicing in the pediatric clinic in the UNC system. 

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee 
members.
I asked her about her original RN degree and she said in 1981 she took part in one of 3 programs that took people with Bachelor’s degrees, and she had 12 months of nursing courses, then could sit for her license exam, as part of a step towards a MSN. 

11.	Barbara Turner wanted me to ask her about her experience with populations and also about her experience with population based resources on the computer and internet. 
She said her population experience was with 3-5 year olds and their families with head start. She said her populations don’t have computers usually so she hasn’t used any computer or internet resources for her populations. I did not go into population based programs/resources because she didn’t understand what I was talking about. 

Committee member’s recommendation:
I would not pursue this candidate for this particular position because her population experience is mainly with pediatrics and she has no knowledge of computer based population health programs or using internet resources. She also has no experience teaching online classes.</Comment>

Wants a chance to teach graduate students, although she is aware that the emphasis will be on pre-licensure students.

Organized, efficient, creative, non-threatening to students, collegial, loves/passionate about community health nursing (has been involved with this content since the beginning of her academic career).

Setting high standards, use of active learning methods, use of personal stories/narratives in the lesson plan; learning is really up to the student- sees faculty role as more of a facilitating process. Giving students choices/input regarding assignments.

Let Gero CNS lapse in 2012 due to pending changes (not allowing preceptor hours to count towards re-certification); runs a community health clinic in a low income housing project in the summers; volunteers as congregational/parish nurse.

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Did ask regarding the sequencing of community health courses in the program, average class size, how often students come to class, whether international experiences were available.

                                                                      Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet

Applicant:  Alicia Ribar, PhD, RN, FNP-BC                                                                                  				Position: FNP

1. What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

Short-term: to engage in additional pedagogical development in order to become a better teacher; to complete the required curriculum revision of the NP program at her current institution; to further develop on-line educational methods of instruction within the NP program at her current institution.

Long-term: to develop a relationship with a mentor to assist in developing a focused area of scholarship/research trajectory.

2. Why are you interested in a new faculty position?

Present position as Director of NP Programs at Otterbein University (near Columbus OH) involves both administrative oversight and teaching obligations. The university, as a whole, is seen mainly as one dedicated to a teaching mission. While she enjoys teaching, she wants more of balance in her academic activities, and since finishing her dissertation, wants a chance to develop as a nurse scholar.

3. Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?

Wants to be a part of an academic community (such as DUSON) with a recognized program of graduate study and an emphasis on scholarly efforts; Duke frequently came up in conversation during her doctoral studies at Duquesne.

4. What are your strengths?

Excellent clinician &amp; primary care provider; excellent teacher with experience in teaching both pre-licensure &amp; graduate level NP students; communicates well with students, other faculty, &amp; staff.

5. What are your weaknesses?

Talks way too fast &amp; too much (her self-assessment); has yet to establish a focused area of scholarship, especially as primary author on submitted manuscripts.

6. What is your most significant accomplishment?

As Director of NP Programs, seeing her students earn high pass rates on NP board examinations; seeing her students become successful and knowing she had a role in their development.

7. What is your teaching passion/philosophy?

Emphasis on the word “participatory”; defines faculty role as one analogous to coach or mentor. Classroom activity, be it on campus or in the virtual world, needs to incorporate teaching/learning styles conducive to engaging the student and therefore instilling in the student a passion for that what is being taught.

8. What are your research interests?

Still nascent, but pointing in the area of her doctoral research, namely modifiable health risk factors; nutrition is one aspect of this interest as well as osteoporosis. Limited funding at this point.

9. What are your practice interests?

Primary care; still practices one day a week as an FNP in a peds/adolescent health practice site. Also has experience as an FNP with adult chronic disease management in primary care settings. Would like to continue practicing as an NP with any faculty role.

10. Questions brought up by faculty:

Faculty practice models utilized at DUSON?
Merits of tenure track versus practice track?

Committee member’s recommendations:
This is a strong candidate for the FNP faculty position. Excellent clinical preparation, 15 years experience as an FNP delivering primary care, recent graduate of a PhD program in nursing, &amp; strong experience as an NP educator. While her area of scholarship stills needs to be defined, I would recommend that she be offered an on campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Dr. Attin has had two funded grants ($8,816 &amp; $20,000), T32 and funded postdoc. No current funded studies.
8 journal articles since 1997 (5 first author) with 2 in review. Presented poster and oral presentations at 11 conferences  between and 1998 and 2011. 


2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Cardiac (electrophysiology)

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has experience with undergraduate and graduate level courses but it is unclear time length of time and when these courses were last taught. Has taught variety of clinical and non-clinical courses including research, pathphysiology, leadership, ethics, &amp; biostatistics.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
No clinical practice noted on CV.

5.	Service to the profession
Member of AHA, AACN, STT and ANA

6.	Job stability
Length or place of employment not noted clearly on CV. Unable to determine.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Area of expertise (cardiac electrophysiology) would be a good match with current faculty. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

Dr. Attin completed post-doc 5 years ago and seems to be progressing in career. Some of this is difficult to translate just based on the scarcity of information in the CV. However, it is clear that at the current level her experience is not at the level of Sr. Researcher. Recommend regret letter.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :     Jennie C. De Gagne, PhD.                       	 	Position:  HCPC


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Overall, productive based on stage of career. She has 9 peer reviewed journal articles, four as first author, seven non-referred or invited articles, 12 conference presentations, and 15 posters. She has 18 citations as an invited speaker. She received intramural funding on five occasions, about ½ as travel awards, and extramural funding for five projects/activities.   

2.	Focused program of research. Not very clear. Some of her research seems to involve informatics, disparities, and education (e.g., teaching strategies).  In her cover letter, it states, “my research and service activities in creating and implementing a patient centered approach to provide comprehensive care within the context of family and community would be of outmost service.” Unfortunately, details about the above are lacking.   

1.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  In the cover letter, she states that, “ I am convinced that I am well prepared to teach areas of population health management, care team leadership, continuous quality improvement, health coaching and education, approaches to behavior changes, skill building for patient self-management, integrating community resources, evidence-based alerts, and more.” At Georgia State University she has taught Leadership in Promoting Innovations, Health Care Technology, and advanced Topics in Informatics. She has also taught at Walden University Transforming health care Through Information Technology and Informatics in Nursing and Healthcare.  Other topics taught include introduction to professional nursing, psychiatric nursing and computing and health information. Clearly, her main teaching is in the use of technology.  There are no teaching evaluations. 

2.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice.   She lists in her CV under “Professional Nursing Experience” having worked in nursing education, impatient psychiatry, and as a case manager. Overall, these activities span from 1990 through 2009, with some gaps in performing these duties.  

3.	Service to the profession. She is a member of several organizations that seem to focus on geriatrics and informatics.  She serves or has served as a manuscript reviewer to several journals, several of which deal with education.  At Georgia State University and while at North Carolina Central University, she has demonstrated being part of several academic committees (e.g., program committees, technology committee, research advisory committees). 

4.	Job stability. From 08/09 until the present, she has been in a department/school of nursing, North Carolina Center University and Georgia State University.  In general, she shows job stability. 

5.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Able to contribute in the areas of informatics, psychiatric nursing and gerontology. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  I think this candidate is very ambitious and has a wide spectrum of skills and education. With that said, it is not clear what she has done with case management and population health. Her background does have her working with different populations (e.g., Korean). Because of a lack of clarity of how her background fits well within the position, but clear evidence that this person show promise, I hesitate, but do recommend phone follow-up.</Comment>

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term – Acclimate to the faculty role. While taught in many venues and audiences she has not been in a full time faculty role.
Long term – While she practices in pediatric neurology she would like to explore how to use her diverse talents and expertise to reach out to the community and SON. She wants to find “niche”, be creative, innovative and excel.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Long term goal and impetus for completing the DNP.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Environment at Duke keeps her coming back; spirit of collegiality and stimulating. Always looking for ways to improve; raising the bar. Want to be a part of that. Excited about publishing more.

4.	What are your strengths?
Persistent and compassionate; team player. Don’t mind leading but likes being part of a group.

5.	What are your weaknesses?
Does not say “no” to requests.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Professionally having made an impact; can see that through her students. Being able to inspire new students (worked with ABSN student this year) and being part of that chain. In teaching she is creating the enthusiasm within the students and helping them connect information.

7.	What is your teaching passion? Pediatric management. Evidence based practice; patho and physical assessment.
a.	Class size: On campus should stay within some confines to allow for exchange of ideas. Not sure where that number lies but can be creative to accommodate whatever class size given. Online prefers no more than 30.
b.	Clinical groups: Prefer working with the one-on-one. Does not have experience with other undergraduate level courses that may have larger groups of students. 
c.	Online : Has taught online in undergraduate and graduate level classes most recently in the DUSON FNP 441 course. Very comfortable with this method of teaching.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
No formal plan for research.  Interest is in school aged children ages 5-12. Migrane action plan (MAP) which was DNP project– reducing headaches in school to reduce time lost in school and socially. For her DNP she implemented on a small scale and the MAP now available on MAESTRO (Duke’s new EMR).  Would like to look at outcome measures from MAESTRO (dx codes, how often used).  Possibility for this to be a QI project for Academy of Pediatrics. Would like to foster and building relationships across disciplines to implement and evaluate outcomes of the MAP.

9.	What are your practice interests?
Pediatric neurology (would like to maintain some time in the pediatric headache clinic)

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Confident that although her practice area is very focused in pediatric neurology that she is comfortable and competent to broaden that scope and teach outside of her practice area.

Committee member’s recommendation:
Has experience with FNP program and DUSON. Passion for teaching and would like to maintain clinical practice. Her DNP project has provided a great foundation for future research collaborations. She is a good candidate but not strong. Not much exposed beyond what was provided in cover letter and CV.  I would like brief discussion about campus visit.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:  Jennie De Gange                                          Position:  Population health coordinator/case manager

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? Did not differentiate between long and short term goals. She sees herself as an educator and continuing to teach and do research. Wants to stay in academia. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position).  She taught undergraduate students at NCCU. She became interested in teaching students at a higher level of education, such as graduate students. She had the chance to do so at GSU (Georgia State University) to teach health informatics and leadership in innovation in health care.  Has family issues; her family is in NC. She travels every week to NC from Georgia.  Wants to go back to NC.  So in essence, it seems that a strong driving force is to find a position in NC to be close to her family. 
 
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke? She believes DUSON is a very high quality institution – has received and is getting degree from Duke (DNP). She is also familiar with DUSON faculty and works with Duke Faculty, such as Ellie McConnell – as part of a geriatric educational program.  Looked at competencies for coordinator and talked to Ellie McConnell who said she is qualified.  She also appreciates the good relationship between faculty and students. In sum, main reasons are: 1) excellent school, 2) good working relationships with faculty, and 3) likes the interactions between students and faculty. 
 
4.	What are your strengths? See herself as: 1) having a great deal of self-discipline, 2) having high expectations, 3) being committed to and loving students, 4) having excellence in time management, and 5) achieving excellence.  

5.	What are your weaknesses? High expectations produces a lot of stress – puts too much pressure on herself at times.  Need to reevaluate at times her expectations. 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment? Came from South Korea came to the U.S. with two kids. Very proud that she was able to work as a nurse full-time while being able to pursue her advanced degree.  Philosophically, she strongly believes in and is committed to life-long learning – will continue to do so.  She would like to transfer the life-long learning spirit to her students. She is proud of being able to get scholarship and pursue research. 

7.	What is your teaching passion? Very student-centered and uses different strategies to match different student learning styles – also reported being an educational major and hence has theoretical knowledge about education.  Open to different teaching formats that vary in class size (7 to 70), seminar or not, synchronous or asynchronous, etc.., She can customize herself to the structure that is needed. For graduate classes, her ideal class size is between 25 to 30. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans? Gerontology education and self-management programs (urinary incontinence/bladder health). Likes to use new technologies (e.g., virtual worlds/online technologies – worked with Constance Johnson) for education, curriculum development and program evaluation.

9.	What are your practice interests? Population/community base.  She is more community based these days – working with someone in the community in South Korea. She wants to develop educational programs (e.g., self-management for chronic illnesses) for health care providers in community settings. 

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

I asked her two questions. First, given that she is a full time DNP student, I asked her how she can handle being a DNP student and being a full time faculty member. Her response was that she has been doing full time work on different tasks for many years. For example, she currently does the DUSON DNP Program while also teaching two to three courses a semester at GSU. She is getting consistently” A”s in her DNP courses. Thus, she sees herself as having very good time management skills. 

I also asked her to elaborate on her case management experiences. Her response was twofold. First, in South Korea she worked for large insurance company as a medical inspector -- really a case manager. She visited clients in home settings and did physical assessments and diagnosis. Based on the outcome, she created a care plan. Overall, she was the go-between patients and health care providers (e.g., facilitate testing and other health care needs). Between 1997-1999,s she worked in a long-term nursing facility for assisted living (mostly older populations with Medicaid and Medicare) as a MDS coordinator. Her responsibilities included assessment and health care planning.   She was also involved in the continuity of care for patients and worked with occupational therapists, recreational therapists, social workers and physicians. She averaged a case load of about 35 patients.  

Committee member’s recommendation: Bring her in for an interview. Of note, she asked about actual program structure (e.g., what is the course name, competencies) and teaching load.</Comment>

See #7 above for areas I would recommend exploring on phone screen and we may want to do comparison to currently considered candidate who is coming for campus visit. She does not come across as the most qualified candidate for this position.</Comment>

1. Research Funding &amp; publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Recent DNP grad; publications adequate for this stage of her career; from paper review, does not appear to have a record of individual funded effort.

2. Focused area of research

Has a strong background in clinical research coordination (has a master’s degree in the same; DNP capstone examined the value of pulse oximetry measurements in infants with congenital heart disease.

3. Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Teaching experience seems to be limited to Duke pre-licensure courses; has been a teaching assistant only since January 2013

4. Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Has been a staff nurse in the intensive care nursery over a 30 year period: staff nurse, patient care coordinator, representative on various internal committees; practice can also be defined here as coordinating/managing six major research studies all focusing on neonatal &amp; pediatric issues

5. Service to profession

Member of National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) since 1990 &amp; has assumed some leadership responsibilities within the organization over that time period

6. Job stability

Appears stable

7. Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

Well acquainted with DUSON research venues &amp; processes

Reviewer’s Recommendations:
I am struggling with the candidate’s possible contributions in the areas of population health or case management. Her teaching efforts have been either in the assistant or clinical instructor role, and even then, confined to the pre-licensure level. Her knowledge base is particularly specialized, i.e. neonatal intensive care. The position calls for evidence of a developed program of scholarship. It remains unclear what she may be planning for her DNP work. Perhaps all of these concerns could be addressed with a phone screen.</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Sandy Blizzard Tripp, DNP, FNP                                          Position:   FNP

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage. There is no record of external research funding.  She has one peer reviewed publication in the Journal of Pediatric Nursing.  

2.	Focused program of research. No program of research listed. However, it is clear she is very interested in childhood obesity. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  As an adjunct nursing instructor at Duke, she has taught N441 and N333.  She has also served in the as a clinical preceptor for the Duke University and East Carolina University Family Nurse Practitioner Programs.  There were documents summarizing her teaching experiences and evaluations. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:  She has been a registered nurse for 26 years in intensive care and management and 15 years as a family nurse practitioner. From 4/98 until the present, she has worked as a FNP for Kingston Pediatrics Associates in NC. 

5.	Service to the profession. She is a member of five professional organizations. For example, she is a member of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners and a member of the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners. She is a reviewer for the Journal of School Nursing. In addition, she volunteers in different capacities for activities that involve childhood obesity. .  

6.	Job stability:  Very stable. She worked as a registered nurse and as a manager for Lenoir Memorial Hospital (6-86-1-98) where, in part, she created a health and wellness program from employees and managed a 34 bed medical unit.  Since then, she has worked for Kingston Pediatrics Associates in NC.  From 8/11 until the present, she has worked as a clinical instructor for Duke University.  

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. This candidate should be able to teach several topics pertaining to the FNP program, especially those that involve pediatrics.  

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
	Has extensive experience as a FNP and is familiar with DUSON, serving as an adjunct clinical instructor.  My reservations are whether she is willing to invest time in scholarly activities, other than presentations. Further,  as stated in her cover letter, &quot;I am interested in a career with flexible hours that encourages my continued participation on committees and given back to eastern NC.  It is not clear what “flexible hours” mean to her given the demands of this position. Nonetheless, I would encourage a follow-up phone interview.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:  Victoria Soltis-Jarrett                                  Position:  Psych NP
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
She feels all NP programs should have some psych content; therefore, her short term goal is to introduce psych content into all the nursing programs at Duke if she were to be employed at Duke. Her long term goal would be to create a psych-mental health NP program at Duke to better service the needs of NC. 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She has reached a pinnacle at UNC-CH by doing everything that she set out to do in that position. She has created a psych-MH NP program there and graduated close to a 100 NPs. She also finds that since it is a state supported school, she has to beg for funds for what she wants to do, there are politics involved and it isn’t easy to advance the psych-mh mission. She was recruited to start up the program and she has accomplished that. She would like to move on to more of a challenge. She finds they are more research focused and there is very little support for clinicians. 
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?
She sees coming to Duke as an opportunity to develop psych-mh nursing in NC. She also would like to build on the established networks that she has which involves the VA. Duke has more of a collaborative relationship with the VA which she finds appealing. She would like to have access to the bases for education and research. 
4.	What are your strengths?
She states her strengths are making sense out of chaos and that she is not afraid of risks or tall challenges. She believes in community engagement at the education level. She also has expertise in writing and is contracted to write a grad level textbook.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Her stated weakness or limitation is not being able to say no to requests. She says she is also very sensitive and gets her feelings hurt easily.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her most significant accomplishment was being president of an international psych society. She was part of moving that society forward and when she took over the organization, it was in a state of chaos. She also has secured funds for a program on schizophrenia. Her other big accomplishment was conducting her dissertation in Australia. 
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
She likes teaching in every way- online, lectures, clinical. She has developed and coordinated the psych-mh np program at UNC-CH and developed all the courses and has taught all the courses. She has about 25 years of teaching experience. 
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Here research interests are in integrative care-adding psych nursing into every aspect of nursing education. She has also studied psychosomatic disorders. 
9.	What are your practice interests?
She has a private practice as a psych np with 2 offices- one in Winston Salem, one in Durham. She sees private patients once every two weeks or once a month. She also has contract work. She would like to continue her clinical practice. 
10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Her CV had not been clear on teaching experience but after talking extensively with her about her prior teaching – I am convinced she has substantial experience in every aspect of teaching. She has developed a program, taught every course, taught undergraduate nursing students, and graduate students, as well as mentored and advised through several different positions. 

Committee member’s recommendation: Bring in for interview. She is quite accomplished and would be an asset to our faculty.</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :  PAMELA JEAN HILL BIERNACKI, MSN, FNP-C                               Position:  HCPC faculty


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No evidence of research or publication history on CV.

2.	Focused program of research
No evidence of research on CV. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
The CV specifies that she has been a “program chair, associate professor” of the ADN –RN program at a community college in Williamsburg, VA since 2000. There is no mention of courses taught. Her cover letter states that she has “taught in every course in the AND program with the exception of mental health nursing with recent experience in second level class and clinical. She has used Sakai and Blackboard.”

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
The CV lists clinical practice as a nurse and family NP but no more detail than that. Her cover letter states that she works part time as a NP currently and is a second year DNP student that has started her capstone project in the family practice setting. 

5.	Service to the profession
She lists current and past membership in 5 professional organizations with no dates, so not sure what her current membership is. She is involved in many committees at the community college and has much community service listed on her CV. 

6.	Job stability
She appears to have job stability- 5 years at her present position in the community college and 10 years with the same medical group as a FNP.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She could potentially function in the HPCC position as her clinical experience gives her the background and she does have experience in the higher education level. She lacks any experience teaching above a ADN degree and she does not currently have a doctoral degree. Her CV states an expected gradation from Duke’s DNP program on 5/2014. When I asked the E. Bloomer about when she will graduate, he relates that Dr. Turner expects her to defend 11/2013. 



Reviewer’s Recommendation:  I am not sure about this candidate- she appears underqualified for a faculty position at DUSON and does not currently have a doctoral degree. My inclination would be to recommend to cease recruitment but we should probably discuss at the search committee meeting. RBK</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage

Has not completed DNP.  Anticipated graduation May2014. No mention of publications. This is a very basic resume and provides very little insight into the applicant’s experience.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
DNP project - “Transformation of Care:  Integrating the RN Care Coordinator in to the Patient Centered Medical Home” 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has taught at the ADN level since 1991 and is currently program chair at Thomas Nelson Community College. There is no evidence of any experience beyond this population. It is unclear types of courses taught and for how long.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Practiced as FNP since 2000 

5.	Service to the profession
Member of multiple professional organizations (STT, NLN, Virginia Council of ADN Educators, Virginia Community College Association, Virginia Council of NP).  Serves on multiple committees at Thomas.

6.	Job stability
Demonstrated stability in FNP role as well as educator role at Thomas

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Has experience with program evaluation. Has clinical expertise as FNP but not sure of population she serves at her current part time position. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

The announcement requested those with expertise in population health or case management and with master&apos;s level teaching experience. The applicant does not meet these criteria (at least what is listed within the applicants CV) and has not completed her DNP. I would recommend regret letter at this time.</Comment>

-	leanred a lot as patient resource manager in ICN – collaboration with patinets, providers, community providers, etc
10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Committee member’s recommendation:
I got the sense that she feels that this position for this program is somehow unique and would therefore help ‘protect’ the person from the demands of the school/master’s program overall. This concerns me in light of the fact that it’s a faculty appointment with same roles/responsibilities as all other faculty. She may struggle with ongoing scholarship given her lack of focus and her background as program manager for others’ grants which seems to make her think of research/scholarship in terms of working on others’ research. Also, she states that she is familiar with the PHCC syllabi and curriculum and can teach this broad content even though her experience clinically and in research and as patient resource manager was in neonatal area.
I am hesitant to recommend a campus visit based on what appears to be a lack of fit but apparently she feels she is a good fit for this particular content and has meet with Dr Turner…… I do think that the other applicant is stronger in terms of scholarship and teaching experience overall.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
-	pending R-01 as Co-investigator under review - ? would it transfer? - focused on diabetes medication adherence in patients receiving primary care at a Federally Qualified Health Center.  The goal of this proposed research is to improve diabetes medication adherence through a cell phone-delivered promotion intervention.
-	very difficult to follow her research on CV – what was ‘submitted’, ‘funded’, size or type of some of the grants listed, ‘role on grant’ – this all needs to be clarified.
-	2 peer reviewed pubs although one looks like it is online learning modules??

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
-	states that her scholarship is focused on clinical scholarship and describes two programs but they are not described as research or in terms of evaluating their efficacy – (Diabetes modules for primary care providers; interdisciplinary educational program)
-	It is unclear from the letter whether her scholarship or research is focused on the work proposed in the R01 pending or the clinical education programs she describes
-	PhD in health disparities of Latina women and then post-doc with great mentors in Diabetes research at Michigan!
3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
-	yes, has taught in undergrad and grad courses. At grad level has taught EBP, theory, evidence-based practice (EBP), health promotion/risk reduction and acute/chronic illnesses in primary care

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
-	very relevant – just completing full time practice in HRSA funded Federally Qualified Health Center in primary care especially chronic disease management (diabetes, CVD)

5.	Service to the profession
-	member of many professional organizations – no leadership roles noted.

6.	Job stability
-	no issues noted

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
-	appears she could greatly contribute to DUSON with her clinical background, experience and diverse background and experience. she has a good research training background (phd and postdoc) but doesn’t appear to have had much time (full time practice/teaching?) to apply this to her own program of research. Would definitely want to explore her research experience further to gain clarity and to see what her goals are in this area and how they might fit with the position.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has taught courses in the doctoral program involving research methods, instrumentation, and health issues in vulnerable populations. She has taught undergraduates on communication and diversity. She mentors undergraduates in research. She chairs 3 PhD students and sits on the committees of 4 others. She has mentored and chaired approximately 10 students. 
4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Dr. Lee has about 14 years of staff nurse experience in the NICU, ending in 2003. 
5.	Service to the profession
Dr. Lee is a member of 8 professional organizations, reviews for 7 journals and grant organizations, and has served on many committees at the school and university level. 
6.	Job stability
She has job stability. 
7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Dr. Lee does not have current funding or a history of recent NIH funding; therefore, does not appear to be a strong match for a senior researcher position. She does research in an area that would fit nicely with the neonatal/pediatric researchers within DUSON as she studies families and caregivers of neonates. She does have experience as a research mentor, but is a new associate level professor. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation: Cease recruitment for application to a senior researcher position as she is not a strong match for funding level and experience level.</Comment>

Applicant :     June Cho, RN, Ph.D.                                     Position:  Senior Nurse Researcher


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Cho has 9 journal publications, seven of which are as first author, and 10 presentations (national and regional).  Currently, she has one R01 pending, that received an impact score of 22 (11% percentile). She had one R21 as PI.  

2.	Focused program of research.  Her interests are in neonatal/pediatrics looking at biophysiological processes. For example, she is interested in issues pertaining to vulnerabilities among low-birth weight babies. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs. Her teaching has focused on informatics and research for nursing and applied statistical techniques.   No summary teaching evaluations were provided. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice. She has served as part of the nursing staff, a nurse manager, and in-charge nurse at Kangman St. Mary’s Hospital in Seoul Korea.  She was also a staff nurse at the Children’s Hospital, UNC Health Care. 

5.	Service to the profession. She is a member of the Society for Research in in Child Development and the Southern Nursing Research Society.  She is serving on four editorial boards/journal reviewer, such as Nursing Research, Psychoneuroendocrinology, and Journal of Child Health Care. She serves on several committees at her institution (UAB and UAB School of Nursing), such as Faculty Search Committee and the Council for Translational Research.  

6.	Job stability. From 2008 onward, Dr. Cho has been with the School of Nursing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  However, she has affiliations with other campuses as adjunct positions (e.g., Graduate school University of Alabama Tuscaloosa) or as a scientist. Overall, it appears she has good job stability.  

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Her desire is to teach information and statistical courses. She could contribute to the research and mentoring of students interested in neonatal processes.  Could be a valued asset in the growing informatics program. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Dr. Cho has as yet to establish a history of external funding for her program of research. Do not recommend a phone follow-up.</Comment>

A lot of tie in with others, but no identified areas of her own
	
3.	 Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Preceptorships/mentoring of NPs &amp; PAs- also MD students
Do not see any real didactic experiences at the undergraduate or graduate level
Lists her American Heart (Instructor) &amp; American Red Cross (Instructor) as her teaching experience

Of note: cover letter was 2.5 pages and rambled. At the top of page 1 he also addresses cover letter to “And the search committee members The Maryland Institute College of Art.” Several syntax/typo errors. In addition, on line 1 of cover letter he mentions “your tenure track” while the position listing clearly states this is a Track II (a non-tenure earling clinical track.”

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She states in her cover letter that she has taught for over five years. She and taught both graduate and undergraduate courses, that include several clinical practicums. Was not clear to me what the content of some of the courses were about. No teaching evaluations were attached. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   She is licensed (RN) in Florida. Does not discuss her clinical experience other than to mention that she has over 35 years of nursing experience to include bedside nursing, cardiovascular intensive care… etc.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr. Ancheta at the very early stages of what appears to be a very promising career; she has not achieved the rank of Associate Professor. She does not have many peer-reviewed publications and has not obtained any “R” level funding. Would not recommend proceeding with recruitment.</Comment>

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Is a great match in terms of expertise and has created mechanisms and resources for faculty members 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
She has great career progression until she left Wayne State and has had reduced/minimal productivity since 2009.  Her cover letter contributes this to her Director of Research position which she states did not give her the opportunity to continue her own work. Because of the pause in her teaching, funding and research, it does not seem that she meets the position description. She states that there are several people that are here that can give positive recommendation for her work. Would based on what is in front of me recommend regret.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant:  Mary Lou Affronti                                    Position: ANP-Gero

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Substantial evidence of research involvement within the Tisch Brain Tumor Center; many publications (primary &amp; secondary authorships). Not clear as to her role on many of the stated research venues- any direct funding?

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Nationally known for her scholarship in the management &amp; treatment of brain tumor patients; at the forefront of translational applications. Graduated with a DNP from Duke this year- voted outstanding capstone project. Has a Master’s in Health Science (Clinical Research), a PMC in Oncology Nursing (ANP), &amp; a Master’s in Nursing- all from DUSON
	
3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has been a Clinical Associate with DUSON since 1989, but unsure as to her actively she has been involved. Per her CV, she has given lectures &amp; has precepted students. Have confirmed that she is a CI in N332 this fall semester. Has lectured quite extensively to specialized groups/conferences, but no evidence of being in a teaching role, or responsibility for managing didactic classes.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
It appears that she has practiced as an ANP at the Brain Tumor Center for many years; has also supervised other non-physician providers. She is obviously licensed as an NP in NC but her credentialing body is not listed on the CV

5.	Service to the profession
Outstanding work within the area of brain tumor awareness &amp; care of the brain tumor patient; several memberships listed including STT, but no apparent leadership positions

6.	Job stability
Almost 30 year history with Duke University Medical Center almost all in oncology nursing positions- staff nurse, ANP, unit administrator, &amp; senior investigator


7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She epitomizes the role of the “translational clinician.” Extensive ANP clinical skills in a much defined sub-specialty. Well established in her field &amp; has great inter-professional connections. Well published &amp; is well versed in the day to day clinical operations of a high profile tumor clinic. Desires a joint appointment (already has an existing clinical associate faculty appointment with the Department of Surgery)

Weakness- no history of formal (didactic) teaching experiences

many peer-reviewed, data-based pubs, first author.

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Deborah Mayer, Ph.D.                        				Position:   Senior Researcher

 Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Mayer is a tenured Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, currently being reviewed for Full Professor. She has 77 peer review publications, 3 monographs, 1 book, and 10 book chapter. She has numerous poster and podium presentations. With respect to research funding, she lists 14 sources of research funding, of which after obtaining her Ph.D., is PI on four – note this not include her being PI on the P50, where she is site PI. Among these, one is from NIH/NCI, the remaining are from Centers or Disease Prevention and Control, South Atlantic American Cancer Society, and one from UNC. Three grants are pending.  

2.	Focused program of research.  Her research focus is on cancer survivorship issues, such as addressing the needs of survivors as they transition from care to longer term survivorship. This includes providing them access to information via eHealth interventions. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She has taught several courses related to oncology nursing (e.g., advanced concepts in oncology nursing, advanced pharmacology in oncology nursing, cancer survivorship, etc.), applications of ehealth, primary care management of adults, and management of complex health problem in adults. She has chaired one dissertation committee and has served on six; she also has chaired 10 thesis/Masters projects, and was a member of three. She has worked with six postdoctoral fellows. Overall, her teaching evaluations are consistently between 4.5 to 5.0 on a five point scale, as self-reported in her “Essay for Promotion to Professor” (see p.4). 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   In the 80s and 90s, Dr. Mayer served as an oncology nurse specialist, staff nurse, nurse manager, chemotherapy nurse/nurse practitioner, and staff nurse. From 2000 to early 2003, she served as Chief Medical Offer for what appears to be a health service media company. She currently serves as a nurse practitioner in medical oncology in the Breast Program at the UNC Cancer Hospital while also serving on the steering committee on the UNC Lineberger Oncology Advanced Practice Providers.      

5.	Service to the profession.  She is currently a member on eight professional organizations (e.g., American Academy of Nursing) and is or has served in numerous capacities to the Oncology Nursing Society, ONS foundation, NCI, ACS, and Southeastern Cancer Study Group – she has been on several advisory boards. Dr. Mayer has served or is serving as a journal reviewer, and is currently the Editor to the Clinical Journal of Oncology, Nursing. She has served as a grant reviewer (e.g., ONS). She currently serves on several committees at UNC (e.g., Faculty Counsel, UNC Survivorship Program Steering Committee) at the School the School of Nursing (e.g., Search Committee).  

6.	Job stability:  From 2007 until present she has been at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and prior to then, four years at Tufts University. Overall, she has had job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Mayer can help substantially with teaching and clinical supervision of oncology nursing. She can also teach courses in informatics (e.g. , ehealth) and adult health. She has experiencing supervising Ph.D. students and chairing dissertation committees. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr.  Mayer has a strong publication record, it well recognized and respected, has mentored several students, appears to be an excellent instructor, and has contributed significantly to the field of oncology nursing in various capacities. If there are any concerns, it is that she has not obtained much external funding as a PI, especially in regards to NIH support. If a criterion to hire a senior level person is transferring established research funding, then this person does not qualify. However, given DUSON’s efforts to secure a senior level person in the area of oncology, the question is whether the Administration is willing to forego the above concern and interview her, given that she would like be competitive being promoted to Full Professor. I would suggest a follow-up phone interview based on the strong need to hire a more senior level person in oncology nursing.</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Karen Aroian, Ph.D.                        				Position:   Senior Researcher

 Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Aroian is an Endowed Professor at the University of Central Florida. She has 53 peer review publications of which more than ½ are as first author. She has 12 extramural grants of which 7 are as PI. Among these 7, 3 are from NIH (e.g., NINR) – with the most recent from 2004-2009. She has numerous podium presentations and poster presentations. 

2.	Focused program of research. Not exactly clear. It appears that her scholarly interests involve various racial and ethnic groups (e.g., Arab Muslims, Latin American Immigrant), that focus on adolescents, adults, and family relationships. Her research seems to involve oncology, issues of distress and social support, and heath care organizations. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  At the University of Florida she has taught qualitative research methods and supervised doctoral research and dissertations; she has been Chair to five doctoral students. At other universities, she has taught clinic practicums, measurement, stress and trauma, systems of therapy in psych, and advanced qualitative methods. Teaching evaluations were not provided. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   Her clinical experience primarily occurred between 1977 and 1999. These positions included: clinical nurse specialist, per diem staff nurse, outpatient psychotherapist, group therapist, and assistant charge nurse.     

5.	Service to the profession.  She is currently a member of three out of seven professional organizations (e.g., American Academy of Nursing) and serving on two editorial boards out of four listed.  She has been involved with several community organizations (e.g., grant reviewer currently with NIH study section on Culture) and has served as a consultant to various organizations – though 2006 was most recent. She has served on many university committees (e.g., APT, doctoral program committee, faculty affairs, University Research Counsel, etc.)

6.	Job stability:  From 2007 until present she has been at the University of Florida, Orlando. Prior to then, she was at Wayne State University for six years. Overall, she has had job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Aroian can help with the teaching of mental health nursing, research methods, qualitative research methods, measurement and issues pertaining to culture. She has experiencing supervising Ph.D. students and chairing dissertation committees. 



Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr.  Aroian clearly has accomplishment much, as evidenced by having an endowed professorship. Would like to know more about teaching evaluations and get a better sense of type of research she does. Also, within the last few years, she has not been as productive getting external funding, especially from NIH as PI. I would like to know more about her plans for future grants and level of productivity getting grants. If she did come to DUSON, it appears she would not be bringing much external funding. As such, it would be worthwhile to inquire as to how quickly she could establish her research here and what resources she would need. Suggest a follow-up phone interview.</Comment>

Subject: followup with PMHNP candidate

Hi, All, 
I did a f/u with Dr. Cox on her plans for completing national certification as a PMHNP. All she’d have to do is take the exam, she meets all other eligibility requirements for the ADULT PMHNP per the ANCC website (copied below). She graduated from UCSF Adult PMHNP/CNS (dual program) MS program with more than 900 clinical hrs in PMH, and completed her DNP at USF.

BUT, the ANCC is moving to the FAMILY PMHNP certification and 2014 is the last year they will let anyone take the adult exam. If we need Dr. Cox to be certified as a FAMILY PMHNP, she will most likely need further coursework since her MS is in ADULT PMH.

ANCC Adult Psychiatric–Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Certification Eligibility Criteria 
Credential Awarded: PMHNP-BC
Eligibility Criteria
•	Hold a current, active RN license in a state or territory of the United States or hold the professional, legally recognized equivalent in another country.
•	Hold a master&apos;s, postgraduate, or doctoral degree* from an adult psychiatric–mental health nurse practitioner program accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) or the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) (formerly NLNAC | National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission). A minimum of 500 faculty-supervised clinical hours must be included in the adult psychiatric–mental health nurse practitioner role and population.
•	Three separate, comprehensive graduate-level courses in: 
o	Advanced physiology/pathophysiology, including general principles that apply across the life span
o	Advanced health assessment, which includes assessment of all human systems, advanced assessment techniques, concepts, and approaches
o	Advanced pharmacology, which includes pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacotherapeutics of all broad categories of agents

<Comment>Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:   Deb Mayer                                                 			 Position:  Senior Researcher
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Goals are at a personal level and are a larger level- she wants to improve cancer care and mentor faculty and students to be good researchers. 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She is interested in Duke because of Marilyn Hockenberry’s idea of a nursing oncology center for excellence. She has been at UNC since 2007 and there has not been a big opportunity to pull together with other researchers for a bigger picture approach- she feels that this opportunity will do that. She feels that this is her last big Hurrah before retiring and she would like to make a difference. She intends to step down as editor of Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing this year and wants to devote more time to research and mentoring.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She said oncology transcends organizations so it doesn’t matter where she is- she has known colleagues at Duke for a long time- she mentioned Brenda N. and Sue S. She said she moved down from the northeast in 2007 and has loved UNC which is a very good cancer center. (She never really answered why Duke except in the previous question)- I asked her was there anything else she liked about Duke but she didn’t answer.
4.	What are your strengths?
She is very experienced with various different backgrounds- she has a long clinical career, has been CEO of her own company, has always been involved in cancer nursing, has held every position in the oncology nursing society, has been a nurse manager, cns, lived and worked in Canada. She has a health policy perspective. She has the ability to zoom in and zoom out to the big picture and go back and forth. 
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Getting over committed, learning to say no, prioritizing what to accept and what not to accept. She said she is also impatient. 
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her daughter first. After than would be her contributions to the field- ONS president, ability to be amazed by opportunities and take advantage of them. 
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
She has taught mostly in the undergraduate program and NP programs. She has a leadership position with the DNP program. She has mentored graduate, doctoral and post doctoral students. She likes mentoring curiosity and teaching students how to think on their feet. She has taught using the flipped classroom, large and small classrooms. She has evaluated her teaching with formative evaluation. 
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
She said her interests are with cancer care, health services research with big data sets, ehealth initiatives, and the health policy nightmare with survivor care plans. She said she has never had an R01 and entered her PhD program late- graduated in 2006. She had written a recent R01 but has turned it into an R21 and it will be reviewed in October. She has had an R01 equivalent by being co-PI on a P50. She has a current pilot study underway. 
9.	What are your practice interests?
She currently practices ½ day per week in the breast cancer survivor’s clinic as a NP. She said she wasn’t sure she wanted to continue practicing and that could be discussed. 
10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. NA

Committee member’s recommendation: I am not sure that this candidate fits the “senior researcher” candidate profile. I was impressed by reviewing her documents alone, but much less impressed after talking with her. She does not really seem to be focused on research – but more focused on clinical aspects of oncology. She has not had her PhD that long and she mentioned she went to an online PhD program. When I tried to discuss research grants, funding, and direction, she seemed to minimize that aspect of the conversation. It does not appear that she would bring funding with her position and she only has an R21 pending.  
I recommend recruitment for another position if she fits, but just not a senior researcher position. RBK</Comment>

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short: Provide NP students with skills (autonomy, critical thinking) as NPs are the answer to the care provider shortage.
Long: teach and publish; obtain grants, do research, and disseminate findings

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Has been at Duke &gt;30 years in variety of roles.  Feels it is time to give back.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Brings experience as CNS, NP, and now DNP. Has support for new endeavor and wants to be a mentor and leader.

4.	What are your strengths?
Liasion with DCI and medical school
Experience in variety of roles
Has taught breast cancer, BMT, and brain tumor classes for Sue Schneider
Has precepting experience with NP students

5.	What are your weaknesses?
Perfectionist.  Have learned not to  micromanage others, able to pull back.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
       Academic credentials and trailblazing research (performed nursing research – at a time that nurses         
       typically didn’t do research).

7.	What is your teaching passion?
       a.  Class size: adapt to anything ; focus on student’s needs
       b.  Clinical groups: has not done undergrad but has precepted NP, PA, and med students one on one.
       c.   Online: has student perspective as DNP all on-line; learned a lot about allocating specific time 
             blocks to focus on what needs to be done

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Oncology of course but also interested in depression assessment and how NPs learn through distance learning.

9.	What are your practice interests?
Would like to do some clinical practice in oncology

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

The Search Committee asked that the following questions be specifically addressed:

a.  What do you need to be able  to teach and develop a course?
      Guidance and mentorship.  Has taught individual classes and precepted but not developed a 
      course.  

b.  This is an ANP position with adult lifespan needs. How can you do this – how are you qualified?
      Even though focus has been oncologic she addresses multisystem issues with patients (chemo causes CV issues;    
      steroids induce diabetes).  No patient comes to hem-onc with no other issues. All the patient’s needs must be addressed.

c.   You mention in your documents about a joint appointment. Please elaborate.
      NP and DNP dovetail. 
      Can teach 100% if that’s what’s needed.
      Would prefer to still be inclinical to stay current. The amount of clinical is negotiable.

Committee member’s recommendation:
Continue recruitment</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :   Nada Lukkahatai                                          			 Position: Senior Researcher 


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Dr. Lukkahatai is at the post doc level working at NINR and she has been there since 2011 following a post doc in Australia for three years. She has 2 first authored, data based publications in US nursing journals, one being Nursing Outlook. She has one first authored review paper and one first authored report in a Thai journal. Although she lists “Research Activities and Funded Projects” on her CV, there are no dollar amounts listed. The two research studies in progress are at NIH/NINR listed as intramural funding. Therefore, it is difficult to assess her productivity.  The productivity seems low for 2 post doctoral fellowships. 
2.	Focused program of research
Her research is in pain and fatigue in chronic illness, focusing on the cancer and fibromyalgia population. She has used genomics, proteomics and bio plex cytokine assay methodologies. She is now working on symptom management with mindfulness and stress reduction therapy. 
3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
It is difficult to assess her teaching experience. She reports in her cover letter having extensive teaching experience in the undergraduate and graduate levels; however, there are guest lectures listed and no definite classes listed. She has co-advised students, but no PhD chair experience is noted. 
4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Dr. Lukkahatai has one year experience as a registered nurse listed on her CV form 1995-1996 in Thailand. 
5.	Service to the profession
There is no academic service listed on her CV in the USA. There is committee involvement listed at Chiang Mai University. She is a member of STTI and was a previous member of the American pain society. 
6.	Job stability
She was employed as a lecturer in Thailand from 2004-2011, and then a post doc fellow at NINR from 2011-present. 
7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
This candidate does not meet the qualifications for a senior research at DUSON. She also has trouble with the English language as evidenced by her cover letter. She has very little experience mentoring doctoral students or junior faculty.

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Sophia Smith, Ph.D.                        		Position:   Asst. Prof. Track III

 Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Smith has 17 peer-reviewed publications, 9 as first author. She has numerous conference presentations. It appears she was PI on one NIH/NIC grant and an NIH/NCI grant. In the cover letter, she states that her series of study have been funded through seven grants totaling $505,000; however, it is not clear what her roles were on each grant. 

2.	Focused program of research.  Her research focus is on cancer survivorship. As stated in the cover letter, her program of research emphasizes “the longitudinal quality of life and patient experience of survivors of adult lymphoma, with particular interest in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), health behaviors, healthcare experiences, and implementation of evidence based supportive care services.” This work encompasses the use of Mhealth. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.   She has taught courses at UNC inprogram evaluation. No teaching evaluations were provided. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: From 1999 through 2001, she has worked as a social work intern.  She also is engaged in providing psychosocial care to improve health outcomes in cancer survivors. 

5.	Service to the profession.   She has or is serving as a reviewer to several journals (14 total), and is a member of four professional societies (e.g., American Psychoosical Oncology Society, Association of Oncology Social Work).  She is involved in several service/community activities. For example, she is a  Duke Cancer Patient Support Program Advisory Board and the NC Advisory Committee on Cancer Coordination and Control. Her prior experience includes serving as a Program Manager for the American Cancer Society and Program Volunteer for the YWCA and YMCA, Sunshine Kids, and the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools.  

6.	Job stability:  Overall, she has had job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Informatics, program evaluation, oncology. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
 The position requires that the candidate have “a minimum level of 50% extramural funding.” It is not clear where she would have this covered. Based on her CV, her more recent grant expired 8/13. As such, the candidate does not meet the qualification and would not consider a follow-up phone call.  If the candidate does have 50% coverage, I defer making a decision until I know what exactly this position is calling for in terms of teaching and other assignments.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant : Judy Stein                 			 Position:  A/GNP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Completed DNP in 2013; MSN in 2000; co-authored 3 pubs in past 8 years

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
None evident in CV or letter. Experience with research through work as research associate and managed clinical trials at DCRI

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Very little teaching experience. Adjunct, part time preceptor positions with no details so it’s not known if these are undergrad or grad students and what the course are.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
18 years specialty practice as A/GNP in endocrine, rheumatologic, cardiac, and autoimmune disorders and in clinical research. May not suit the need for primary care teaching.

5.	Service to the profession
None evident in CV or letter

6.	Job stability
Good

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Hard to know; CV is somewhat vague. Applicant seems to think her experience as a student will contribute to her ability to take up a faculty role.


Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Applicant has minimal teaching experience and clinical practice has been specialty and research focused. Will need mentoring in teaching. Do not pursue further recruitment.</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No publications
Multiple presentations and working on a few texts but some are really focused on her holistic health approaches and traditional cultural arts; not professional activities or scholarly work.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

5.	Service to the profession
	Member of professional organizations - no leadership roles noted

6.	Job stability
	Has held multiple positions clinically and in teaching – not clear whether this is reflective of the types of populations and areas she works in or if this is problematic.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Rural health/ clinical care in underserved areas/holistic approaches and cultural approaches to healthcare.
Has teaching experiences that fit the needs of this position.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  

I recommend not to pursue candidate further – lack of scholarly activity and multiple roles/jobs. Seems to also be focused on her own ‘business’ or traditional  crafts and holistic products? Focus on faculty role and ongoing scholarship is quite diverse and unclear.</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
No research funding or publications listed on CV. Reminder- he is a recent DNP grad (8/13) from UA-Tuscaloosa. DNP Project- literature review of perceived barriers to geriatric mental health

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Other than the DNP project, nothing mentioned
	
3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Adjunct faculty with UA-Tuscaloosa since 9/13- primarily associated with a online mental health course for Psych NP students. Has had some teaching experience in other health professional programs

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Psych NP since May 2012. Currently licensed as an NP in a state (NM) with full plenary authority. Also licensed as an NP in Arizona. ANCC certification as a Family Psych Mental NP. Currently lists Psych NP practices in three different locations. Interesting that he has also been a dental assistant, a pharmacy technician, and a licensed clinical social worker.

5.	Service to the profession
Reviewer for the American Psych Nurse Association- Scholarly Review Committee &amp; Student Scholarships (2013). 

6.	Job stability
Lots of position changes since graduating from college

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Is licensed in an area in which DUSON has traditionally been weak

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Candidate does meet the basic requirements according to the position statement. He is duly licensed and credentialed as a Psych NP, but he is still relatively new to the advanced practice role. He does, however, have clinical experiences from his previous social worker role. In addition, he has very limited teaching experience &amp; he is currently teaching his first graduate level course. I think as he matures in the role he may have something to offer in the future, but for now, I think he is continuing to try to find “himself.”

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Toussaint Battley, DNP Candidate, MSN, FNP-BC                        Position:    FNP

 
Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  There are no noted publications other than three manuscripts stated as being authored (page 3 of CV) – full references were not provided. There is no evidence of research funding or other forms of scholarly (i.e., research) activities other than pursuit of a quality improvement project for requirement of the DNP.  

2.	Focused program of research.  None stated.   

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  Very vague. The candidate has focused on teaching undergraduate students (2010-2012) at the rank of instructor. He taught online course in health promotion. He has supervised students at various clinical sites while at Southern University, Shreveport, and at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC). He has guest lectured Junior I Medical-surgical nursing students during their Neurological rotations. No teaching evaluations were provided. He holds the distinction as a certified nurse educator (CNE) by the National League of Nursing.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   He has had three years of experience working as a registered nurse in the Emergency Department at Overton Brooks VA Medical Center, as well as the medical-surgical unit.  At LSUHSC in Shreveport, he served as a neurosurgical nurse practitioner or four years.  During 2012, he worked at a Louisiana Public Hospital as a nurse practitioner in the primary care clinics and urgent care clinic. At an organization called MD2U, he has provided individualized holistic health to patients and their family (Nov. 2012 – present). He is certified as a nurse practitioner, and his Masters in Nursing has a focus as a FNP.

5.	Service to the profession.  Is a member of Sigma Theta Tau. No evidence of serving as a reviewer  

6.	Job stability:  has been employed at several places. His CV seems to suggest his works 40 hours a week at two places (LSUHSC) and at Interim Louisiana Public Hospital. Most of his positions have lasted for a few months or two to three years. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Can provide clinical supervision of students. Could teach courses on health promotion. Capable of teaching online courses.  

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr. Toussaint Battley it at the very early stages of his career – and has yet to obtain a DNP. There does not seem to be a program of scholarly activity.  Further there does not seem to be any evidence of teaching at the graduate level or with diverse populations, both factors that would have been desirable per the position announcement.  I would suggest not going forward with the candidate.</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation-		FNP Candidate Battley

1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
Three manuscripts mentioned: one required as a part of his academic program associated with his MSN (does not appear to be published), another submitted to the journal Neurosurgery (no evidence that this was accepted for publication), and lastly, what appears to be his DNP capstone (no evidence that this has been submitted for review).

No evidence of extramural, but again, this is not unusual for a soon to be DNP (scheduled to graduate this month, 12/13)

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
No mention of research or scholarship interest other than his DNP project- “Short Message Service Reminders to Increase Appointment Attendance in Primary Care.”
	
3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
All of his teaching experiences have been at the undergraduate level- guest lecturer, adjunct instructor, &amp; instructor rank. Southern University School of Nursing (ADN program), Axia College/University of Phoenix (ADN program)- both of these appear to be part time positions, but difficult to ascertain. Since 12/2012, has held full time instructor rank at La. State University Health Sciences Center, but uncertain as to what he actually teaches. States he has been a part of the school’s curriculum committee.

Of note, he does hold a CNE certification through NLN.

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
FNP certification since 2008 through ANCC; recertified through 2018.  (3) NP positions listed since 11/2012: twenty hours per week in an ER setting, ten hours per week in a home health setting, &amp; lists a current FT NP position in neurosurgery at La. State Univ HSC (which is interesting as he also teaches FT at the same institution). In addition, he completed a six month stint as an NP at a local urgent care center in 2012.

BSN earned in 12/2009; staff nurse experience in an ER setting

5.	Service to the profession
Appears to have been inducted into STT in 2007 as an undergraduate while attending Northwestern

6.	Job stability
Appears to be a lack of a vocational focus. He also lists two concurrent FT positions.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Does have stronger experiences at the undergraduate level ( &amp; AND). Not quite sure there would be a good match here.

Applicant :   Rafa Kasim                                                			 Position:  Statistician


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage
The applicant is currently in a consultant position. His last academic position was at Kent State from 2003-2011, as an assistant professor. He has been co-PI on two grants from 2008-2011 of approximately 250k each. Prior to that, he had funding in 1996-1998. He has many publications, with one currently “accepted for publication” with journal of Statistics Education. His last peer review publication was in 2005, although he has many publications listed as conference proceedings and encyclopedias by Sage Publications. He is a prolific presenter and has won awards for scholarly presentations. 


2.	Focused program of research
His background is in Measurement and quantitative methods and his research is in multilevel analysis- methods and applications. 


3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
He has extensive teaching experience in all areas of graduate statistics. He also has extensive mentoring and consultation experience with faculty and students. 



4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
He is not a nurse, but statistician. He has extensive experience in consultation for research and statistics. 

5.	Service to the profession
I see no university or school service list on his CV, but he has experience as a reviewer, organization member, chair of programs for conferences. 

6.	Job stability
He had two academic positions- one as an assistant professor for one year at University of Alabama, and one for 8 years at Kent State. He has had several years consultant employment as a statistician. He is currently in an independent consulting position. 

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
He would be an asset to DUSON as a consultant to students and faculty for statistical methodology, analyses and research analytics. He could teach all levels of statistics and participate as a committee member for doctoral students. 



Reviewer’s Recommendation: Areas of Concern: I would want to know why he left Kent State and why he hasn’t been promoted to associate professor. Also, why he doesn’t have any peer reviewed publications after 2005. Committee should discuss.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
	Sub-investigator on 4 different grants, 2 past, 2 current through 2014 but only one pub and one in 	review

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
	Mostly diabetes-related; interest is in translational research related to chronic disease

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Has taught in the MSN program at DUSON as a seminar leader and lab instructor, clinical instructor and preceptor; has not coordinated a course. Recent DNP graduate, no experience mentoring DNP students.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs
As a clinical preceptor but no evidence of on-going mentorship. Not sure what is required for FNP faculty. No experience mentoring DNP students but has had recent experience as a DNP student.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Unclear…4 years as an NP in a specialty practice (endocrinology); describes self as a “seasoned clinician” but does not seem to have any generalist primary care experience.

6.	Service to the profession
	 National Advisory board of ANA; volunteer work in local community and medical missions to underserved 	countries

7.	Job stability
	Good

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage (summarize).

 PhD completed in 2006. The candidate is a faculty member in the Division of Community and Family Medicine at the DUSOM. She has participated in many large funded projects as an important team member, some Co-I. PI only on a small internal grant. She states she has 98% funding, although it looks like 2 grants are expiring in 2013. 2 additional grants are under review, plans for submitting 1 additional as PI. Unsure of the implications of this on potential teaching load and transfer from SOM to SON.

Summary: 7 years post PhD, her productivity is minimal as an independent investigator, however, her performance on a research team and training is fantastic.
Publications: Pubs: 3 1st, several 2nd. Publications are satisfactory for career stage.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: Yes. Program of research is focused on cancer prevention, family-based research, and health disparities, with additional areas of expertise in health behavior theory and intervention research.  

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs: No real teaching experience. Is this needed given funding and Track III?

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs: None, poor

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: Trained as researcher. No clinical practice

6.	Service to the profession: None, but now on Duke IRB.

7.	Job stability: Very good

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON: Diversity, intervention work, health communication

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

How much funding do you have, when will it expire, and how will your current funding change if move to DUSON?
What level of teaching are you anticipating?
What areas do you think you could teach?
What was your grant writing experience on other grants within your research team?
Have you attended grant writing workshop?
Would you like to become an independent researcher or prefer to continue to work on research teams?


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Clarify the goal of the position and teaching and research expectations with Dr. Merwin and the candidate. The candidate does not have any teaching experience and has limited experience with grant submissions (that we can tell from the CV). If the goals of Dr. Merwin and the candidate match, recommend phone screen to obtain additional answers to the questions posed above.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :     Rafa Kasim                             	 				Position:  Statistician


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  He has 29 published papers, 4 as first author, and numerous reports and conference presentations.  Several involve issues pertaining to education and substance use.  He was CO-PI on a NSF grant (2009-2011), PI on a grant funded by Statistics Canada (96-98), and Principle evaluator on a grant funded by Health Plus Insurance Company in Michigan. 

2.	Focused program of research.  His research interests are in “Methods developments in multilevel analyses and their applications to medical, business and educational data.” Per his cover letter, he is currently, working on “developing appropriate methods for calculating effect sizes from single-subject design studies via HLM.”

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  Per his cover letter, he has been teaching graduate level statistics and quantitative methods for more than 15 years.   The courses taught include basic and advanced statistics, multilevel analysis via linear and non-linear models (HLM), multivariate statistical analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), experimental and quasi-experimental designs, quantitative &amp; survey research methods, evaluation and measurement, classical &amp; modern tests theories, and meta-analysis

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice.  None [he has served as a statistical consultant for years.]

5.	Service to the profession. Served as: 1) a grant reviewer to the U.S. Department of Education, 2) editorial board member to three journals (e.g., Mid-Western Educational Research Journal), 3) program and session chair (e.g., Division D; Measurement and Research Methodology Division Educational Research Association). 

6.	Job stability. No concerns. Most recently (2011-present) serves as a private statistical consultant for personal, institutional and research organizations. From 2003-2011, he served as an Assistant Professor in the Gaduate School of Education, Health and Human Services at Kent State University.  Before then, he served as a senior statistician at the Evaluation, Management, and Training (EMT) research firm at Folsom, California.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Can teach a broad spectrum of statistical courses (e.g., see under 3 above) that can benefit most, if not all programs at DUSON. Has the capacity to consult with students and faculty. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  Would recommend a phone screen in light of his expertise in teaching a broad range of statistical courses and his consultation with various professional groups. Would inquire about why he was an assistant Professor at Kent State for so many years (response may provide clues as to why he went into practice as a private statistical consultant), and his experience working with faculty in grant submissions.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

Yang is currently finishing her PhD in biostatistics at UCLA.  She has had no external funding for her research, and has 6 published papers, none of which is first-authored.  She has had a conference paper published as a first-author.  Her productivity is commensurate with her career stage, as well as the fact that her research activities as a graduate student have been in a consultative role as statistician on diverse research projects, including research in the School of Nursing at UCLA.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

She has provided statistical expertise to a wide range of health-related studies, including those with methodological foci that align with DUSON’s focus on trajectories.    

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

She has served in teaching assistant positions, and she notes in her cover letter that she received good student evaluations, although no actual evaluation metrics were provided.  The two courses for which she served as a TA align with DUSON courses in our MSN and PhD programs. 

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

Not applicable

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Not applicable

6.	Service to the profession
She is a member of ASA, which is appropriate for her area of doctoral studies.

7.	Job stability
She is currently employed at RTI while waiting to graduate---I am unclear why there is a significant gap between date of defense June 2013 and graduation in March 2014. Note that her CV does not reflect the date of her final defense.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Could teach statistics in MSN, DNP, and PhD programs;  strong history of providing statistical support to faculty research projects and being able to articulate her contributions to the methods and stats of the various research projects.  Her current role at RTI likely will strengthen these abilities.  Further, she has experience working large secondary databases, as well as clinical trials.  

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
Clarify her teaching assistant experience to gauge readiness for lead instructor positions; clarify time gap between defense and graduation that does not fit with academic calendars; explore her current role at RTI and rationale for application to DUSON instead of remaining at RTI

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Due to my current understanding of the role of the statistician position (i.e., focus on consultative role on other faculty members’ research projects), Ms. Yang shows strong promise in being skilled and effective with this role.   As noted above, she can clearly articulate her statistical and methodological contributions to each of multiple studies in health sciences to which she has contributed, demonstrating the ability to work with a range of datasets as well as needed programming expertise.  Further, her expertise in longitudinal analyses and multi-level analyses fit well with DUSON methodological foci.  I am less able to discern her potential for teaching from her CV, and this would need to be explored via the phone screen (as described above).  Continue recruitment.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :        James J. Weidel          			 Position:  Psych NP/ FNP


Areas of Evaluation

1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

Finished PhD in 2013 from University of Miami, finishing post-Master’s as Psych MH NP in May 2014. This would be his first faculty position. Publications are on different topics: book chapter on infection control; HIV and mental health for Hispanic men; risk taking behavior concept analysis, sex and drugs; IPV and HIV in Hispanic. Seems to have an interest in diverse populations from publication topics.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
	
	He doesn’t give a title for his dissertation work, but does report a dissertation grant from Florida 	Nurses Association, and STTI Beta Tau Chapter. Does not list amount of funding from either.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs 

FNP position requires 2-3 years of graduate level teaching experience as desired; from CV cannot tell what level he taught as adjunct faculty.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

No mentorship listed in CV

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Has been a FNP since May 2007; fluent in Danish, proficient in Spanish. I’m not sure why he has a State of NY FNP license – job record does not show him in NY.

6.	Service to the profession

	Volunteer work at Universal Heritage (free clinic to uninsured 1 day/ week); member of FNA, STTI but 	no leadership positions or service listed.
	
7.	Job stability
	
	Looks like he has not worked since 9/13, even though finished post-Masters in 5/13. Has 5 years 	clinical experience as FNP in Minute Clinics/ Urgent Care; one year of practice in Family Practice.
	Variety of experience as traveling nurse on a variety of units.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

	Based on CV, he would bring psych mental health expertise, though he has not completed the post-	Masters nor is he certified as a PMHNP yet. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

	1. What level of education is his teaching experience in – BSN or MSN?
	2. What did he teach in his adjunct faculty role at Florida International University?	
	3. Is he interested in tenure-track or clinical track? If tenure, which faculty could mentor him or is a  			close research match?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

	He seems to have an interest in working with low SES and minorities related to mental health issues. He seems like he would be a better fit with the Psych NP position, but has very limited teaching experience. Therefore, he will need a lot of support in order to teach in the graduate program. He will need to meet NC requirements for nurse educators. It just depends on what area of expertise Psych MH in graduate program needs are. Would recommend for phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :  Christine Tocchi          		 Position:  Adult/Gerontology Nurse Practitioner

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? For career stage (summarize)

Applicant is currently postdoctoral fellow at NYU and will be completing fellowship in August 2014. 
Only funding found was Hartford Scholar pre-doctoral fellowship, but none specifically listed on CV.  However has been funded for post-doc position through Ruth McCorkle’s R01 and also currently funded for a research assistantship through Mary Naylor’s R01 from 2009 to present. 

The applicant has 5 first author submissions/publications, four other team database publications, 2 book chapters, and 4 poster presentations.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Her primary research goals are directed at prevention of frailty in older adults. As a doctoral student at Yale University School of Nursing, she developed the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE), a holistic instrument to identify older adults as frail or at risk for frailty. Her postdoctoral fellowship has concentrated on further psychometric testing of FIFE and dissemination of her research. Her future research plans are to examine the effects of nursing interventions to prevent and minimize frailty.  Her ultimate aim is to participate in interdependent collaborative research to prevent and manage frailty to maintain older adults in the community.

She received a Hartford Building Academic Gerontological Nursing Capacity Scholarship and co-developed a Geriatric Primary Home Care Program and a Geriatric Resource Nurse Program (through Nursing Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders) at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, CT. These programs were developed to enhance nurses’ knowledge and skill in caring for hospitalized older adults and to expand primary care to frail elders living in the community.   She has active membership in the national Gero organization to enhance learn leadership skills and promote gerontological nursing. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Her teaching roles have included Coordinator of the Geriatric Nurse Practitioner Specialty, program instructor, and lecturer in the Adult, Family, Gerontology, and Women’s Health Primary Care Specialty at Yale University School of Nursing. The courses she taught have focused on common and complex health problems of older adults. She has incorporated a variety of teaching strategies in her courses primarily emphasizing an interactive approach through case studies and discussion on individualizing evidence-based practice to meet the needs of the diverse older adult population. She makes a point in her cover letter that she strives to provide an environment for students to express themselves freely, incorporate critical thinking, and to consider the needs of older adults within healthcare, social, historical, and political contexts.

She has been lead faculty for Physical Assessment and Gero courses for 5 yrs at Yale and 3 years at Southern CT State Univ.  She has also been a Clinical preceptor for Gero students for 2 years.  She was also the Coordinator of Gero NP speciality at Yale for one year.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

She has been mentored by many well-respected leaders in the field:  Ruth McCorkle, Mary Naylor, Gail Melkus, Jane Dixon, Sharon Inouye, and Christopher Van Dyke.  She does not specify the number of students she has mentored, but her teaching experience runs over 10 years, so it would seem plausible that she has mentored many nursing students in Gero NP speciality. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Her clinical expertise is also strong and very focused on Gero patient care.  She was a staff nurse for 8 yrs, a Gero NP for at least 10 yrs and continues to practice clinically at the Fairfield Co. Senior Center.  She ran a Gero Resource nurse program at Bridgeport Hospital for 3 yrs.  Also her clinical experience shows at least 2 years in administrative positions. 

6.	Service to the profession

Her CV shows a commitment to Service since 1999 by participation on following committees: 

University School of Nursing Executive Committee
Curriculum Committee
	Ad Hoc Task Force on Teaching and Learning
	Ad Hoc Task Force on Course Evaluations
Member of the Evercare Medical Advisory Committee, Hartford, CT, April 2005-September 2007.

She shows a very stable pattern of living &amp; working in the New Haven, CT area.  Her experiences have built upon one another nicely and shows good productivity and great potential for strong Gero program of research.  

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

There are several areas of potential contributions to DUSON, such as Gero NP skills, teaching Gero and Physical Assessment courses, research experience with P 30 center grant, and two R01 research projects. She shows a strong track record of commitment to research and service.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

•	Ask about post-doc fellowship---still on target to finish in Aug 2014?  If selected, when would she see herself wanting to move/start?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Because of strong research and teaching background in Gero, as described above, I would consider her a strong applicant for DUSON and would proceed with phone interview.</Comment>

Additionally the applicant is experienced in UCLA’s program evaluation process and would be helpful as we try to improve our DUSON student &amp; program evaluation process. 

If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
•	Did you successfully complete your PhD?  When?
•	Any recent publications?
•	Explain more about teaching experience and whether applicant has only teaching assistant experience or experience as lead instructor. 
•	Funding track record or contributions to others’ grants?


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Potentially strong Stats applicant with many areas of potential contributions/match to DUSON projects &amp; needs (see #8 above).  Would continue the interview process with phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:     Juanita Rass                                               			 Position:  FNP
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term: learn the system, get comfortable with assignment
Get involved in research

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Wants to a school with a reputation in nursing research; has never been in an institution where research is important and believes she is ready for this change.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Research reputation and variety of NP specialties; 

4.	What are your strengths?
excited, enthusiastic w/ students, supportive. Curious, wide variety of clinical experiences, open to trying new things, flexible. Able to see challenges as learning experiences

5.	What are your weaknesses?
 has trouble settling, having one narrow thing to focus on

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Being a better human being, more compassionate

7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size: any size; has taught 30-40 students and also one-on-one precepting
b.	Clinical groups: has done only one-on-one precepting with NP students
c.	Online: has developed and delivered on line classes to MSN and DNP students
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy: having students learn everything they need about a topic; putting the learning into the students hands, what do they want to learn? Adapt to students styles, find out what works best; not big on testing; wants to expand students curiosity, open their eyes to new perspectives

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Not clear; area of scholarship is “weak” has not done much research, involved in clinical practice, wants to develop more of this; health and wellness, away from pharm into changing life styles, getting patients more interested in their health care. But does not know how these interests fit with DUSON.
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Interested in practicing 1-2 days/week in a general primary care practice

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Not clear she has any particular reason for pursuing a position at DUSON eccept that she is familiar with and enjoys the Durham area
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: Do not pursue; she has strong clinical skills as a general practice primary care NP and has had a variety of interesting clinical experiences in remote areas including remote health clinics in small villages where she was embedded in the community and the only provider responding to routine and emergency situations,  but is not clear on why she thinks this fits DUSON, what she will contribute to the faculty and students here. Also she is clear that she wants a 9 month appointment, will not consider 12 month.</Comment>

I don’t feel confident she could sustain 50% funding on her own. She has very little to no experience submitting her own grants. I am not certain how likely her funding from her current home would continue if she moved to DUSON. At this time I recommend no further efforts to recruit. PT

Dear Paula and Brigit:
                Please see Beth’s response below. My interpretation of this email, and Beth please correct me if I am wrong, is as follows. Laura could contribute to areas we have teaching needs, even though we have current faculty who can teach them; perhaps the most central issue is whether she can maintain external level of funding through obtainment of grants, etc. My own concern is not so much if she can teach, but more whether she can consistently obtain 50% research funding – which is perhaps a question to ask the candidate—and importantly contribute to areas of research that we have a need (e.g., cancer prevention research, patient provider communication). Let me know what you think based on Beth’s comment so we can make a final recommendation to the committee. I think we are close to closure on this position.
 
Take care,
Isaac

Isaac,
We have sufficient faculty to teach health promotion until any one individual who is teaching it becomes funded or is not available to teach.  We continue to be hiring numerous contract faculty to teach in the area of research/scholarship in the master’s courses.  This is the likely primary teaching assignment but would also see her as a back-up for health promotion.  We can only fill the position if she has 50% external funding so that should be documented.  The question for me is whether or not she would make a significant contribution to our research mission----does she have the potential for significant success in research, including ongoing external funding and can she support the teaching needs of the school.

I agree with Bridit. Dr. Fish has no teaching experience and it is unclear when her funding will expire. Unless we have serious unmet teaching needs in the areas mentioned by Beth, I vote stop recruitment at this time. If we do have needs, then I would recommend phone interview to clarify funding.

Subject: More information about the track III position for Laura Fish
 
Dear Paula and Brigit:
            Hope both of you are well. Per our last search committee meeting, a couple of questions were raised concerning Laura Fish with respect to the Track III position. One of them was what the teaching expectation and courses would be. I asked Dr. Merwin to clarify this issue further. Her emailed response is below.  
 
Based on this updated information, please let me know whether you believe a phone screen is warranted. The two most salient issues that emerged were how would be able to sustain 50% funding given her current and submitted grants and her experiences teaching. In your consideration to this question, please keep in mind what skills and background she would bring that would benefit DUSON. If you could let me know if the next day or two, that would be great. Thank you again for your efforts and input.
 
Take care,
Isaac
 
 
 
Isaac,
My apologies for the delay. I wanted to get some feedback from a program director on appropriate courses for a non-nurse with a PH background. 
I would expect that she would teach in the research/scholarship and the health promotion content areas.  
The expectation would be that she would be 50% externally funded and that she would teach an additional 3 courses.
Take care,
Beth</Comment>

<DateOfComment>2014-01-18T00:00:00</DateOfComment>
<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
Dr. Thompson’s funding and publication productivity far exceeds her current role as Consulting Associate with DUSON. She has had her own NIH funding (RO3, NINR, completed in 2012) as a PI, in her current staff position. She has 1 first author, 2 2nd author, 3 last author, and 7 other publications. I do not see a publication from her NIH study. Most of her publications are reflective of her strong role as consulting with other PI’s or DNP students.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship. Dr. Thompson lists her research interests as quality of life in children and families. Given her high level of teaching and service in her current position, I believe she has a strong potential to develop her own research agenda in a faculty position.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs: Dr. Thompson has taught N307 and N308 since 2009. She has also provided consultation to over 100 DNP students in our program which has been an incredible service. She is easy to work with and extremely helpful to students. She is a tremendous asset to our current DNP program in particular. I believe Dr. Thompson is well qualified to meet the teaching requirement for the current position.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs – Dr. Thompson has provided mentorship to DNP students as described above. She has also served as a statistician to many faculty and provided consultation and statistical expertise.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: Dr. Thompson is trained as Clinical Psychologist with a strong focus on statistics. I am not qualified to review her overall knowledge of advanced statistics, which is important and could be explored during interviews. 

6.	Service to the profession – Commensurate with current position.

7.	Job stability – Excellent. Dr. Thompson has remained at DUSON with advancing responsibilities and roles since 2009 after completing a research fellowship.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – In her current staff role, Dr. Thompson already provides consultation to investigators and DNP students, has taught statistics, and has been a PI on her own NIH funded project. As a faculty member, she would be able to continue to teach statistics, serve on DNP and PhD committees, consult with faculty, and submit her own research projects for funding. I believe she is an excellent match to our program and would be a very strong asset to students and faculty.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked: Elaborate upon statistical training and strengths/weaknesses in analytic methods. Clarify her expected role with DNP students and her future goals as an independent researcher.


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  
Given her current role at DUSON, I would recommend bypassing a phone interview if this is a possibility and elect for on campus, in person interviews, as well as reference checks. Can one of our statistician faculty be asked to interview?</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :            Julie Thompson  			 Position:  Statistician


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
	
	Candidate is seeking to come in as an Assistant Professor? It appears that this would be her first faculty 	position, but she has academic experiences.  She has obtained her own funding as PI 2009-2012 	through NIH/ NINR, and has worked on multiple research projects with Duke Faculty and other 	universities.  	She does not have any peer-reviewed publications as first author; but has 10 	publications, 2 in press, and 7 in review. As a statistician, maybe that’s appropriate.
		
2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

She seems to have her own research focus, but has also worked with many different projects to give her diverse experiences.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

She’s already teaching for DUSON, and has adequate teaching experience listed. 

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

Her cover letter indicates she has worked with over 100 DNP students on capstone projects, this is not reflected in her CV.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

She is a psychologist by training but applying as a statistician. She appears to have a lot of experience in the role she is applying for.

6.	Service to the profession

No service listed in her CV.

7.	Job stability

	She has worked with DUSON for the past 3 years, and her CV reflects job stability.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
She seems to be a good fit within the DUSON community already, and her application to this position appears to be a good match for our needs. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

What her rationale is to move now from being a consultant to full-time? (she says it a logical next step in her cover letter, but no details as to why).

(I’m not sure how much service she would be expected to have, but it’s another “hole” in her CV, along with the mentoring she reports in her cover letter that doesn’t show up on her CV).



Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:   I think she should move forward with phone screen. She has three DUSON faculty listed as her references plus one external person. She appears to be able to handle a pretty significant workload in working with students, I just wonder why this work isn’t reflected in her CV.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :                  	Rebecca Crawford		 Position:  Assistant Professor, Track III


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

She has never published, nor received research funding.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Stated interest in furthering her dissertation research in the area of self-care and symptom management of adults with heart disease; conducted dissertation in rural health catchment area at risk for health disparities 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

4 years teaching experience, 3 as clinical faculty at UTennessee School of Nursing and 1 year at the ADN-level as Director and program faculty at the Santa Rosa Junior College ADN program

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

None 
5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Clinical practice experience in the area of cardiovascular nursing 
6.	Service to the profession
Active in Sigma Theta Tau; extensive volunteer service activities, many of which relate to cardiovascular care

7.	Job stability
fine
8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Not a fit with Track III;  potential fit with a Track II faculty position
9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Based on my review of Dr. Crawford&apos;s CV, I would not support continuing recruitment.  She has no publications and no history of funding. She does not meet minimum criteria, nor has she demonstrated the potential to meet, track III faculty criteria.  Perhaps she misunderstood the position for which she was applying?</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:  Rafa Kasim                                                   			 Position:  Statistician
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? Short term, to find a stable place, conduct research, and have a chance to express his interest in teaching.  Overall, he wants more of an academic environment that has interaction among faculty. Long term he is planning to continue research. He hopes to establish a research center where several people can interact and share interests as well as provide support for faculty and students.   

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Overall, the department he is in has a different agenda than his own (policy and objectives have changed). He is not getting support for what he is trying to do. [Details are provided under the question as to why he left Kent State at the bottom]. 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  More interested in an academic setting. Duke University seems to present this setting. Always wanted to work within medical academic fields.  Has seen this kind of research and likes it. 

4.	What are your strengths? Have a passion for teaching and research. He does consulting a lot and considers it a part of teaching.  Has a good solid background in research methodology, especially in multilevel analyses.  Has been exposed to people with different fields and hence has been exposed to different research. Overall, he is focused more on research and consulting. 

5.	What are your weaknesses? Need to be more exposed to other fields and technologies (e.g., new software to conduct research and analyses). 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment? When working in the private sector, he got involved in a major project funded from the National Health Institute.  He adjourned a meeting of researcher and found a major fault in how they were conducting the research (e.g., comparing treatment vs. treatment rather than treatment vs. control). Once recognized, he was able to develop a way of distinguishing treatments and devise a method to show effects of the intervention (i.e., treatments). 

7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size:  When teaching basic and intermediate statistics, he generally favors between 20 to 30 students. With a specialty/advanced class (e.g., multivariate, multilevel), prefers around 10 students. He really thinks that interaction is with  students is key, especially for more advanced courses.
b.	Clinical groups: No general preference as long as they have preference in the material. He has taught students from various disciplines such as psychology, education, computer science, nursing, and communication.  Sat on Master and Ph.D. committees – found psychology students were more interested in research.  
c.	Online: He did teach online when he was at Kent State. Has no problem with it (used Blackboard though not his preference). He taught night class and found students to be tired; online may be helpful to these students.  
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy. Considers teaching is an art that consists of two parts: having a mastery of the subject and the art of delivering the information.  For him, teaching is a way of preserving and dissemination knowledge in a way that is well done; this is his philosophy. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans? Multilevel analyses and its applications. Develop some methods calculating effect sizes for single subject designs. Hopes to collaborate with other faculty. 

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? NA

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

A.	Why did you leave Kent State? Program changed direction in many ways. He was not getting enough support for conducting research (e.g., could not get a student, had conflict of interests with Chair of Program). He was teaching all the advanced courses in statistics, but many students were not interested in these. Could not find many faculty within the department of education to collaborate with. Although he tried to collaborate with others outside his Department, this still was problematic. Program overall was small.  
B.	Why was he not promoted to associate professor?  He did submit his application packet for Associate Professor but was not granted the promotion.  He thinks the reason for not being promoted was political (e.g., conflict of interest with the Chair). The feedback he received was that he was not active enough if the Department of Education. They asked him to leave.  
C.	 Why no peer reviewed publications after 2005. Has a 2013 peer reviewed article.
 
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:  This is not an easy decision. However, I would recommend inviting him to campus for the following reasons. First, he has a strong evidence of statistical expertise and application that can serve both DUSON students and faculty. Second, he seems to enjoy teaching and the student interaction and has taught numerous courses. My main concern is the lack of promotion from Assistant to Associate and the reason for it. Minor concerns were his teaching philosophy (e.g,. Emphasis on how knowledge is conveyed) and what he considered to be his major achievement (i.e, no focus on interaction with students). Overall, he demeanor over the phone was calm.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Samereh Abdoli, Ph.D.                        				Position:   Senior Researcher

 Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Abdoli is an Assistant Professor of Nursing at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Iran. She has 30 paper publications of which 18 are as first author. She has 33 paper/poster presentations. Although there is mention of being involved on different research grants in the cover letter, it is not clear what role she had, type of grant(s), amount of funding, and which grants are active, if any.  

2.	Focused program of research.  Her research is focused on diabetes management and stigma. Her future research is aimed at “exploring empowerment and diabetes related stigma in a multicultural context and developing questionnaires to measure diabetes-related stigma and empowerment…” 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She has taught sampling in medical research and statistical methods in medical research.  These courses were taught over 10 years ago (2004). She has also taught advanced research methods and qualitative research methods.  There are no teaching evaluations. 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:    Not clear. She has served as a clinical and research instructor for nursing students. 

5.	Service to the profession.   Is a member of ICN and the Iranian Association. No clear evidence of being a journal of grant reviewer, other than the International Nursing Review Journal.  Has or is serving as a member of the medical education committee and a member of the nursing and midwifery care research center.  

6.	Job stability:  No concerns. From 2009 until the present she has been at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Iran.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr.  Abdoli can contribute to teaching research methods, qualitative methods, sampling and statistical methods. However, details about statistical methods are lacking.  She can also contribute to courses that involve endocrinology. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr.  Abdoli has a strong publication record at this stage of her career, has mentored nursing students, and has an active area of scholarship in diabetes and stigma. However, in the cover letter and CV there is very little information as to what her skills are as a statistician (e.g. details about methods of statistics), how she has collaborated/consulted with faculty as a statistician, and her reasons for wanting to pursue a position as a statistician.  My recommendation is not to pursue a phone screen.</Comment>

Applicant :      Samereh Abdoli       			 
Position:  Asst Prof Track III

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
Unclear about whether she has had funding or what type of funding from CV &amp; cover letter. She mentions being in “research grants” in the cover letter, but it is not clear what type of grants or what studies these were associated with. Currently applicant is Assistant Professor, Nursing and Midwifery Faculty, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. Finished her PhD from Univ of Med Sciences, Tehran in 2009. Honor graduate. MSN thesis was on osteoporosis in menopausal women. Has 23 first/second author papers and 6 other author papers in mostly European or Iranian journals. 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Her primary research goal is directed towards understanding the concept of empowerment in living with diabetes. She is also focused on identity and stigma in diabetes as a chronic disease.  Her future research plans are aimed at exploring empowerment and diabetes related stigma in a multicultural context and developing questionnaires to measure diabetes-related stigma and empowerment as well; with an ultimate aim in developing an anti-stigma program to overcome chronic-disease related stigma and facilitate empowerment process in people living with chronic diseases.  She was selected as the distinguished researcher two years in a row in 2011 and 2012 by her university. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
Her experiences include teaching physical assessment, med-surg nursing, qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods research. A course she describes as “Endocrinology/cardiology” has been her main teaching responsibility, but she has taught &amp; mentored students at undergraduate and graduate (MS &amp; PhD) levels—unclear if these were all nursing or from other disciplines. In addition, she has involved undergraduate students in writing research proposals, gaining grants and presenting the results in national and international journals and conferences.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs
Other than the students mentioned above, and 4 PhD student dissertations she describes in her CV, no other specific mentoring mentioned. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Unclear 

6.	Service to the profession
She is member of ICN, and has served on numerous university committees at both Arak University and Isfahan University. This includes being a member in Nursing and Midwifery Care Research Center, Community-oriented Nursing Care Committee, Research Committee, and Curriculum Development Committee to organizing diabetes parades and non-profit activities to educate people about diabetes. 

7.	Job stability—seems like she has been very stable.  But curious as to why she is interested in leaving Iran at this time.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
She could teach undergraduate ABSN courses such as physical assessment or Med Surg Nursing.  Also in the MSN or DNP or PhD programs she could teach intro research (core in MSN) or qualitative/quantitative methods.  

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
•	More about whether courses taught were as primary course coordinator or just lecturer.
•	More about who her students were.
•	More about her program of research ---what type of funding she has had or plans to write for.
•	More about why she wants to teach stats or research if she is a Midwife who teaches about Diabetes.  Just doesn’t seem to fit together.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

I would say that although she has a great publication and service record, I am not sure about her research funding or ability to get same once in U.S.  And seems odd that she is trained as midwife, researching stigma of diabetes, and now interested in teaching research and stats.  I would either not pursue this candidate at all or pursue by phone to have our questions answered before exploring this candidate any further.</Comment>

Applicant:  Kathryn Evans                                                  			 Position:  FNP
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Her short term goals are to secure a permanent position as a faculty member and learn the basic essentials of how to be a good nurse educator. She wants to continue her scholarship in clinical research and her DNP research. Long term, she wants to become an excellent nurse educator and develop her leadership skills. She wants to contribute to the school and become a leader in the school.
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
She has been adjunct faculty which was more a temporary position while she was completing  her DNP. She has aspired to be a nurse educator grounded in practice and this would help her accomplish that goal. 
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke? 
She thinks Duke School of Nursing provides the type of nursing education she believes in. She also says that Duke offers excellent teaching resources, especially the teaching excellence center. She has attended some of the presentations by Terry Valiga’s center and has really enjoyed them. She also has established practice and research collaborations at Duke already.
4.	What are your strengths?
She says she is well rounded. She has had exposure to many levels of care and is a leader in her division. She was picked to help with research because of her leadership skills and her organizational skills. She is a good team player. 
5.	What are your weaknesses?
She is early in her academic career and will need mentorship.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her DNP capstone project. She implemented a protocol for diabetes ketoacidosis with the Duke epic role out that is a multidisciplinary protocol. It has been successful and has made significant improvement in patient care. Her involvement in this is ongoing. 
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
She really enjoys teaching clinically relevant content. She currently teaches acute and chronic management in the FNP/ANP program and really likes it. She likes classroom and clinical settings and has enjoyed online teaching as well, but she prefers in person teaching. 
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
She is on a few NIH funded trials with a hypertension trial, a comparative effectiveness study, and a diabetes combination treatment study. Dr. Lien is initiating some diabetes inpatient and outpatient research study about patient safety and has sought her out to be involved in that. 
9.	What are your practice interests?
She enjoys her practice in endocrinology and is involved in management of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, chronic illness and psychiatric issues of her patients. 
10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
I asked her about her practice and was it specialized in endocrinology or did she manage other conditions. She had given me the list in question #9 saying that the patients are in the endocrine clinic but come in with many problems related to multiple systems, which she was comfortable handling. 

Committee member’s recommendation: Continued recruitment. I think this FNP would make a nice addition to our faculty. RBK</Comment>

Applicant:            James Weidel                                   			 Position:  FNP/ Psych NP

Phone interview Tuesday, January 28, 2014 1:30-2pm with Melissa Batchelor-Aselage

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

Short term goal is to gain experience and grow as an educator in a supportive environment. Doesn’t want to leave clinical practice and thinks Duke would be supportive of him teaching and practicing clinically. He identifies himself as a junior faculty, and doesn’t know much about curriculum development. Long term goal would like to gain these skills and develop mastery of the teaching role. Interested in faculty based clinic. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)

Has not had a faculty position before, but likes clinical practice. Was in Durham last month and the reputation of Duke is excellent. He states he is moving along in his Pscyh NP program. Interested in teaching in the MSN or DNP programs. Wants an institution that will mentor him, and allow him to mentor students.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  

He answered this question in the two above questions. Basically, Duke has a great reputation and he thinks it would be a supportive environment.

4.	What are your strengths?

Likes to engage students in learning rather than memorization. He is able to identify his own learning needs and says he’s not afraid to say, “I don’t know”. Encourages feedback from students when he serves as a NP preceptor and wants a rationale for all of their answers. Believes in questioning care provided and individualizing care.

5.	What are your weaknesses?

Junior faculty and not much experience lecturing. Has filled in for other faculty for guest lectures only. He has no experience with curriculum development. He used to be flexible with deadlines for students, but now tries to adhere to deadlines to avoid overworking himself at the end of a semester (“sometimes I am too nice”)

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?

Most proud of his work at FIU in the free clinic, it was an “eye opening” experience, and he loved that job. Got to work with a very diverse population (people devastated by war, lost everything, and had to adjust to life in America). Enjoyed the psych aspect of his job at the clinic. He wanted to understand their experiences, rather than just prescribe medications. Also proud of completing BSN to PhD program.

7.	What is your teaching passion? 

Likes psych, but also like physiology. Like to know the rationale with neurophysiology and neuropsychology.  Thinks these topics are like putting the pieces of a puzzle together, and likes students to think of how one thing leads to another (gave me an Adams Family  analysis that I didn’t quite understand the link to the question I asked him)

a.	Class size – has only taught in classes of 50-100 students

b.	Clinical groups – has worked with clinical groups of 8-10 students, prefers 8 to a group. “When there are 10, I have to find the places to hide to find the students”

c.	Online – very limited online teaching experience, more related to online student evaluations. No online course development experience.

D.	Discuss teaching philosophy – doesn’t have a formal teaching philosophy, but says basically, he doesn’t believe in memorization. He encourages inquisitiveness, getting students to be excited about learning. Knowledge improves and changes over time. Students should learn to always have a certain level of discomfort, as a motivating factor to question things. Likes to get students to talk aloud about their thinking process/ rationale, rather than just providing an answer. (then he went on a little side conversation about the Civil War) 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?

Substance abuse and adolescence. Interested in the neuroscience of addiction. Previous research delved into how adolescents devalued their futures, and their interaction with providers. Has not published his dissertation results yet, as the study is ongoing and will not be complete until the end of this year. He is currently writing up the preliminary results.

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
n/a

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

Practice interest is Psych, and is eligible to sit for certification in May. He will do so, and plans to maintain FNP and Psych certifications. Says ultimately, he would like to blend both to work in community/ public health/ underserved clinic.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

There weren’t any questions for him specifically that I saw. His questions to me were about mentorship for teaching, and is looking for clinical track position.

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:

He seems like a friendly person, and was very focused on clinical practice and teaching. These are the two things he primarily wants to do, but did indicate that he wouldn’t mind working with a research team.  He is going to need a lot of support to develop as an educator as his CV reflects, and as he points out. No experience in curriculum development or course development in any venue (classroom or online). He does have clinical precepting experience, and clinical experience with groups of 8-10 nursing students. He is currently in Arkansas completing clinical hours for his Psych NP degree, and will move from Florida this summer. His ideal start time if successful in obtaining interview and position at Duke would be late summer or fall of 2014.

The focus he articulated would make him a candidate for a clinical track assistant professor, in either the Master’s or DNP program, but he will be essentially brand new to academia and teaching. Not sure of program needs in order to make a recommendation, but he didn’t strike me overall as a super strong candidate for the FNP or Psych positions. Maybe an interview would help tease that out?</Comment>

<Comment>Phone interview: 1-31-14
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? 
Short term: Dr. Thompson has been a consultant with DUSON since 2009 teaching stats in the MS program and consulting with a very large number of our DNP students to assist with oversight of their statistical analysis. She short term goal is to become a full member of the faculty in order to play a larger role with students, vs. consulting. Dr. Thompson would like to participate in DUSON committees to better understand the functioning of the school and how she can better help DUSON and in particular DNP students. She would like to be more visible and accessible to students and faculty. 

Long term: Continue to work with DNP students, serve on DUSON committees, conduct some independent research and EBP projects. However she would like her main role to remain teaching statistics and working with students and faculty.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position, and why now? (If they are currently in a position) This is the next logical step, or “life chapter”. Her children will both be in school in the fall and she feels this is the time to pursue a full faculty role. She was trained as a developmental psychologist and has worked for DUSON since obtaining her PhD. 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Duke is a very prestigious institution and she has enjoyed working at Duke as a consultant. She believes due is the ideal setting  to pursue an academic career. 
4.	What are your strengths? Teaching statistics and working with students. She expressed satisfaction in helping students walk through the process of learning statistics and feels joy helping them “get it”. 
5.	What are your weaknesses?  Not a nurse, still learning language and culture. 
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment? 
A.	Working in the DNP consulting role that was established to help DNP students perform their own stats
b.	 Serving as a PI for a NIH funded RO3. She was able to manage the project and obtain a 2nd site when facing recruitment challenges.

7.	What is your teaching passion?
A.	Class size: stats: 20-25 in person
b.	Clinical groups: NA
c.	Online: Dr. Thompson currently teaches N308 online.  Discuss teaching philosophy: Try to identify where each student is and go at their pace. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?  Developmental early childhood. After obtaining her PhD she worked with Diane and Sharron in a project studying  families. She has been able to understand how this area of research fits nicely with nursing research. Dr.Thompson expressed the desire to start a small research niche, while maintaining the primary focus of her position as teaching statistics and working with the DNP students. 

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA 

10.	What are your practice interests; NA

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. 
Elaborate upon statistical training and strengths/weaknesses in analytic methods. 
Training: in grad school, grad school most advanced stats courses, basic, HLM, advanced, SEM, heavy qualitative training. Prelims: extra paper on stats
Strengths in analytic methods: quantitative, group comparisons, anovas. But comfortable with all advanced stats, including analysis of longitudinal data. 
Weaknesses: qualitative methods

Clarify her expected role with DNP students: Dr. Thompson discussed some current frustration with working with DNP students at somewhat of a disadvantage as a consultant vs. a faculty member. She believes she should NOT run the statistics for students, however, she is asked by some capstone advisors to run the stats for the student, and thus she has felt pressure to do it from the student and advisor, at times. By not being a faculty member, she is unsure of policies and does not have the opportunity to always interact with faculty. For example, she was not aware of the ability to use Mediasite sessions as options for students in her online classes, or other basic resources that could help her work with the MS and DNP students. She would like to continue to teach stats and attend the program committee meetings and serve on DNP capstone committes as appropriate. She would like to be more involved in the faculty role with students.  

Elaborate on past role with DNP students in regards to mentoring. Verify 12 pubs with students? 

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: Pursue active onsite interviews and obtain references. Dr. Thompson is a proven entity who has worked with our MS and DNP students for years. She is a very competent statistician and fills a critical role in both programs. She has worked with students through successful publication and is always a pleasure to work with.</Comment>

<Comment>Final question for phone interview:
My past role with DNP students has included a wide range of consulting, starting with abstract assistance and continuing through manuscript re-submission. Mostly, my role has been helping students choose the correct statistical test and understand the SPSS output. I also have helped a lot with G Power analysis and presentation techniques (tables, bar charts, run charts, etc). 

I am unsure what it means by &quot;verify&quot; the 12 pubs with students. In certain circumstances, the student had a very difficult time with the interpretation and write up of the results. Given that I have helped over 100 students with some DNP Capstone aspect, this is a small number. But, when my role included the actual statistical analysis and write up, which created a &quot;considerable and significant contribution to the manuscript&quot; I was then given distant authorship. And let me reiterate that the students were required to review the output and interpretation with me  to ensure they understood it.</Comment>

Finishing her post-doc fellowship in August 2014, and next step in launching her research career is a full time faculty position as Assistant Professor.  
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Looked at many schools who have national presence with Hartford Scholar program, strong senior faculty research gero mentors who have published in that field, and opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration at medical center and Pepper Center, the literature demonstrates that there are many Gero researchers at Duke University doing translational research work.
4.	What are your strengths?
•	Numerous years in clinical practice of elderly.
•	Great mentorship as beginning researcher.  Learned so much being part of bigger multidisciplinary research team.  
•	Instrument development experience of questionnaire development measuring concept of frailty in elderly.  Mentors have taught her to focus on details of project and she has succeeded in completing successful research study of dissertation and instrument development. 
•	Aware of fact that although she has had great mentors and great research experiences, she is still junior faculty and admits she will need further mentoring.
•	Post doc has given her the opportunity to see slightly bigger picture of program of research than just the first study (her dissertation). 

5.	What are your weaknesses?
•	Fact that she is junior faculty who will need mentoring especially as she moves on to next study with development of interventions.
•	Will need guidance as she enters new university culture to lean about culture at DUSON, the new culture of care of older adults in Durham, and culture of Duke University.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Along w/ Geriatrician, co-initiated primary care clinic for frail elderly in community. Also development of the Frailty Index for Elders (FIE) tool. 

7.	What is your teaching passion?  Teaching Gero nursing course in MSN program
a.	Class size—20-30, like getting to know each student individually, love  the dialogue  and interactions with students to adjust her teaching style to meet their individual learning styles and needs.   Has taught up to 90 students at one time in her physical assessment  classes. 
b.	Clinical groups—certainly can do that after my years of experience, but not sure how that works with multiple Gero NP students doing rotations in different parts of the country.  Really loves the Gero seminars to meet with students to debrief cases after their clinical rotations.
c.	Online—know very little about online teaching techniques, but know this is the wave of the future and interested to learn.
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy—I know that all students learn differently with different styles of learning and at different paces.  I feel it is important to learn about my students and tailor my want of teaching to individual student needs.  I enjoy seeing the moments when students finally catch on to a difficult topic or concept. She asked about the IEE teaching fellowship and was very interested to hear that DUSON values mentoring for excellence in teaching as much as we value excellence in research.  

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?  
Candidate’s research interest is to have a research intensive career as faculty member in research based School of Nsg, with  interdisciplinary collaborations in the community and wider university.  She has ideas for next 22-4 studies with maybe one more descriptive project before moving on to intervention research project.  

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Currently practicing one day/week (Wed afternoons) during post-doc.  And she feels it would be important to do same here in Durham to learn the Gero environment in NC.  She is certified as ZNCC and would be interested in keeping that certification.   Currently works w/ Epic EMR in her current job, so was pleased to hear that Duke uses Epic system as well. 

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
She is on target to finish her post-doc fellowship in Aug 2014 and would be able to move that month to start new position in Fall 2014.  

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Candidate was very well prepared for questions, had thoughtful answers and definitely ideas for developing her program of research and a strong track record of potentially fundable projects.  Her program of research seems to be a good fit for DUSON, her interests in teaching Gero &amp; physical assessment seem to meet our needs for faculty in those courses, and she seemed very interested in learning online teaching techniques. Would recommend that she be invited to campus for interview.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :     John Bainbridge                                            		 Position:  Statistician


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity. Dr. Bainbridge has five journal publications, none as first or senior author. He has two oral and two poster presentations, none as first or senior author.   He has four technical reports and lists 8 publications in which he provided statistical consulting and data analytic services. He is currently on two grants – he is not the PI. He was also on one other grant. He has contributed to grant and contract proposals in health care and other fields within both academia and industry. Note that he is due to receive his DrPH In biostatistics, May 2014.

2.	Focused program of research. His research interests – as expressed in the cover letter – are in the areas of health services with a general focus on quality improvement. He has worked with the analyses of large datasets (e.g., SEER Medicare data), and has both experience and expertise in such areas as experimental design and research methodology, within and between subject designs in behavioral research, survey design and general psychometrics     

3.	Teaching experience.  While he was a Lewis and Clark College, he taught introductory Statistics and the Research Methods sequence; however, this was a while back (1994-1995). As a graduate student at the University of Oregon he served as teaching assistant for two classes, although it is not clear that they were statistical courses. No teaching evaluations were provided.

4.	Mentorship experience. He states in his cover letter, that he has “mentored students at the undergraduate, masters, and doctoral levels, as a committee member at Lewis and Clark College, in SAS programming associated with the M.P.H. at Harvard, and in analysis of SEER-Medicare data for the Health Policy Management program at UNC.” His industry experience includes mentoring junior programmers.   

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice.  NA

6.	Service to the profession.  He is a member of three organizations: American Statistical Association,  
American Society of Clinical Oncologists, and the International Association for Statistical Education. He has also provided SEER-Medicare data mentoring for PhD students at UNC in Health Policy Management Program using this data for their dissertations (2009-2011). There is no evidence that he served as a journal or grant reviewer. Aside from this, he provides statistical consulting, including for a nursing faculty member at UNC, in such areas as Design of Experiments, Research Methods, Generalized Linear Mixed Models, Nonparametrics, Sampling, Data Analysis, Modeling &amp; Simulation, Statistical Process Control, and Metrics.

7.	Job stability. No concerns. During the last 10 years or so he has been involved in statistical programming and analyses at several locations. For example, from October 2012 until now, he works as a Biostatistician III, in the Immunology Quality Assurance program Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University. Prior to that, he largest stint of employment  (December 2005 – March 2011) was as a  Applications Analyst, at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Dr. Bainbridge can contribute to teaching introductory and perhaps advanced research methods and statistical courses to a wide range of students. For example, as he states, he has used such analytical tools that include: OLS, ML, REML and GEE based techniques; procedures included Proc GLM, Genmod, Mixed, and GLIMMIX; he can also help with multilevel and longitudinal generalized linear mixed models using MLE. He also brings research expertise in cancer and in the analyses of large datasets. 
 
9.	Questions for candidate.  Would like to know about the following areas:
1.	How much experience he has working with academic faculty and in what capacity.
2.	In what ways has he contributed to grant submissions.

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  He seems a promising candidate, with a wealth of experience doing statistical consulting. However, is it not clear what his experience is with working with faculty in general and specifically on grant proposals. I would suggest doing a phone screen to obtain more in-depth information about these issues.</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

Dr. Bai has not received any funding of his own and it appears he has worked in the statistician role or research associate role. He is currently a statistician at Duke in the Center for Child and Family Policy. This level of funding is probably appropriate given the positions he has held post PhD. 

Dr. Bai has 15 peer reviewed papers, many are either first, 2nd or last author. This is more than appropriate given his current position.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Dr. Bai has several distinct areas of research including: Child Health, Child Abuse and Neglect, Social Work, Education. He states he has methodological expertise in the following areas:  Advanced Methodology (Multilevel Modeling, Proportionate Hazard Model, Multiple Imputation Approach, Survey-Design Data Analysis, Propensity Score Approach, Social Network Analysis, and Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition Approach). There areas of interest could match potential faculty areas.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.
 Dr. Bai has no teaching experience listed on his CV, thus not a good match in this area.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs:  None listed on CV. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: 

Dr. Bai received a BA and MS in Clinical Medicine (China, equivalent to MD in China), and  PhD in Health Policy and Administration (2007). I am not a statistical expert, but do not believe these degrees provide the preparation needed for our position.

6.	Service to the profession: Dr. Bai is a reviewer for multiple journals.

7.	Job stability
Fair. 1 year at UNC School of Public Health post PhD. Approx 4 years at Duke at the Center for Child and Family Policy, Statistician role

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON: public policy and child mental health

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
Please discuss in more detail your role with formal and informal teaching of graduate students.
Please discuss career aspirations.
Please discuss your statistical analysis expertise.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Decline. 
1.	The positions needs for high level complex statistics and the candidates training do not match.
2.	The positions needs for teaching and the candidates’ lack of teaching experience do not match.</Comment>

	Co-author on 5 publications, has 2 in review (first author on one), and list 3 dissertation papers that are in progress. Lists 8 publications that he provided statistical consultation for, but was not involved in authorship. 
	He has worked on one grant listed as a “HHSN27220070054C” (I’m personally not sure what funding mechanism this is), and lists his role as the “Statistician” – in its second funding cycle. Not sure of institutional affiliation for this project (?Maybe VA?) He also lists a second grant, but not sure what his role was on this project, or where this took place.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Primarily seems to have experience in oncology. In his cover letter, he lists his dissertation focus as 
“using generalized linear mixed models with a binary outcome to characterize multilevel trajectories, based upon cancer registry data, and their application in generating an institutional level quality metric”

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Currently teaching a course on “Falling into Flying” and has experience teaching “Intro to Contact Improv”(1999-2003 with the exception of 2003-2004 he did not teach this course). He lists teaching a Research Methods course in 1994-1995, and serving as  a teaching assistant 1990-1991.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

He has provided professional service to UNC PhD students in Health Policy Management, but lists this as “mentoring”. Also lists SAS Mentoring, served as a master’s thesis committee member in 1995-1996.

	He will finish his doctorate in May 2014. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  


This is a new graduate completing his doctorate in May 2014. He does not bring a lot of experience in teaching or statistical analysis and I understand that is what is needed for this position.  Given the level of expertise needed for the current position, I would not recommend a phone screen at this time.</Comment>

Completing DNP in 2014. Adult NP since 1980, FNP since 1995 though does not list these as Masters degrees. She lists a clinical scholarship project in the cover letter but there are no details about what this involves. I imagine it is a DNP capstone project but She does not describe the focus. Has one pub pending in a sleep medicine journal on breathing disorders in children. 4 local presentations.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Maybe sleep medicine? No scholarship focus identifiable from CV or cover letter. Has worked as FNP in an asthma, ENT and sleep medicine clinic since 1995. 

3.	Teaching experience 
None evident from CV or letter. Lists as curriculum development an independent study course in ethics she developed in the DNP program.

4.	Mentorship experience 
Preceptor for NP students from 3 universities.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has worked as an NP in various primary care clinics with adults and adolescents since 1982

6.	Service to the profession
None evident in CV or letter

7.	Job stability
Good

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Clinical practice in primary care; 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
It is unclear why the candidate is interested in an academic position at this time.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Do not pursue recruitment because of lack of teaching experience beyond clinical precepting, lack of evidence of scholarship and lack of evidence of interest in developing scholarship.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :      Partick Bradshaw            			 Position:  Statistician


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
Completed PhD in epidemiology in 2009. NIH pre-doc training grant, 05-05, NIH post doc fellowship 09-10. Lots of pubs and conference presentations. Trainee on a career development award, fellow on an external grant.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Not sure if this applies, has been co-author on a wide range of research pubs, maybe epidemiology is his focus? I don’t really know how to read this for a statistician. Has done a fair number of things with cancer.

3.	Teaching experience 
Teaching assistant or guest lecturer in Quantitative methods, epidemiology, stats at 3 different universities. Seems he has not been responsible for a full course.

4.	Mentorship experience 
Has been a member of 4 doctoral committees, not chair.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
N/A

6.	Service to the profession
Reviews manuscripts for several journals, several conference presentations

7.	Job stability
Good

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
I can’t say, I don’t know how advanced his statistics abilities are. It does not look like he has not been on any NIH grants and I can’t tell from his pubs what stats he is doing

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
The types of stats he is fluent in, how complex and/or advanced?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  I support phone screen to discuss his research statistics experience unless someone else can discern this from reading the CV</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:  Rafa Kasim                                                   			 Position:  Statistician
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? Short term, to find a stable place, conduct research, and have a chance to express his interest in teaching.  Overall, he wants more of an academic environment that has interaction among faculty. Long term he is planning to continue research. He hopes to establish a research center where several people can interact and share interests as well as provide support for faculty and students.   

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Overall, the department he is in has a different agenda than his own (policy and objectives have changed). He is not getting support for what he is trying to do. [Details are provided under the question as to why he left Kent State at the bottom]. 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  More interested in an academic setting. Duke University seems to present this setting. Always wanted to work within medical academic fields.  Has seen this kind of research and likes it. 

4.	What are your strengths? Have a passion for teaching and research. He does consulting a lot and considers it a part of teaching.  Has a good solid background in research methodology, especially in multilevel analyses.  Has been exposed to people with different fields and hence has been exposed to different research. Overall, he is focused more on research and consulting. 

5.	What are your weaknesses? Need to be more exposed to other fields and technologies (e.g., new software to conduct research and analyses). 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment? When working in the private sector, he got involved in a major project funded from the National Health Institute.  He adjourned a meeting of researcher and found a major fault in how they were conducting the research (e.g., comparing treatment vs. treatment rather than treatment vs. control). Once recognized, he was able to develop a way of distinguishing treatments and devise a method to show effects of the intervention (i.e., treatments). 

7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size:  When teaching basic and intermediate statistics, he generally favors between 20 to 30 students. With a specialty/advanced class (e.g., multivariate, multilevel), prefers around 10 students. He really thinks that interaction is with  students is key, especially for more advanced courses.
b.	Clinical groups: No general preference as long as they have preference in the material. He has taught students from various disciplines such as psychology, education, computer science, nursing, and communication.  Sat on Master and Ph.D. committees – found psychology students were more interested in research.  
c.	Online: He did teach online when he was at Kent State. Has no problem with it (used Blackboard though not his preference). He taught night class and found students to be tired; online may be helpful to these students.  
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy. Considers teaching is an art that consists of two parts: having a mastery of the subject and the art of delivering the information.  For him, teaching is a way of preserving and dissemination knowledge in a way that is well done; this is his philosophy. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans? Multilevel analyses and its applications. Develop some methods calculating effect sizes for single subject designs. Hopes to collaborate with other faculty. 

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? NA

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

A.	Why did you leave Kent State? Program changed direction in many ways. He was not getting enough support for conducting research (e.g., could not get a student, had conflict of interests with Chair of Program). He was teaching all the advanced courses in statistics, but many students were not interested in these. Could not find many faculty within the department of education to collaborate with. Although he tried to collaborate with others outside his Department, this still was problematic. Program overall was small.  
B.	Why was he not promoted to associate professor?  He did submit his application packet for Associate Professor but was not granted the promotion.  He thinks the reason for not being promoted was political (e.g., conflict of interest with the Chair). The feedback he received was that he was not active enough if the Department of Education. They asked him to leave.  
C.	 Why no peer reviewed publications after 2005. Has a 2013 peer reviewed article.
 
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:  This is not an easy decision. However, I would recommend inviting him to campus for the following reasons. First, he has a strong evidence of statistical expertise and application that can serve both DUSON students and faculty. Second, he seems to enjoy teaching and the student interaction and has taught numerous courses. My main concern is the lack of promotion from Assistant to Associate and the reason for it. Minor concerns were his teaching philosophy (e.g,. Emphasis on how knowledge is conveyed) and what he considered to be his major achievement (i.e, no focus on interaction with students). Overall, he demeanor over the phone was calm.</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:          Yu Bai                                          			 Position:  Statistician
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term goals are to move from staff position to faculty position---realizes that will be 50% teaching &amp; 50% research and actually looking forward to interacting w/ students.  Long term goal is to be 100% researcher (funded by other’s grants as well as his own)  in the area of Health Policy and Social Science. 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Current position is a staff position doing statistics for faculty and only rarely with students.  His interation with students is explaining results and he wants to be involved earlier in the statistical process and on committees with PhD students.  So b/c his current job offers little face to face  interaction w/ students, doctoral committee work, and participating in faculty research from the beginning of the project, he would like to change positions.  Wants to teach and also participate with statistician &amp; nurse faculty colleagues.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Opportunity to move from staff position to faculty position.  And has strong interest in areas of Health Policy, Clinical research, and social science, which the DUSON position affords him.  His training included a Clinical Medicine degree from China, which is the same as a medical degree here in the States.  So he would like to be more closely involved with clinical research topics and health policy and feels that background &amp; expertise is a strength.
4.	What are your strengths?
Dr. Bai feels he has 3 major strengths: (1) he has Clinical Medicine degree from China, which is the same as a medical degree here in the States, so could offer knowledge and expertise in clinical research topics; (2) his comfort with and experience using high level statistical methods; and (3) working on multiple grants simultaneously .  
5.	What are your weaknesses?
No experience teaching face to face or online.  Feels he could teach MSN stats course very easily face to face, but may need help or teaching assistant if required to teach online.  Also has no experience working as member of doctoral committee or being PI on his own grant.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Helping the School of Pub Policy faculty develop process for data management and analysis.  He has initiated process of helping faculty bring him in at the beginning of writing grants, helps with planning design, analysis, variables, etc.  Then with data management helps faculty in building databases, creating new variables, discussion of how to address missing data issues.  He does all the data prep &amp; analysis  in SAS.  Then uses STATA to do model runs or additional analysis and organizes outcome in STATA b/c that is what faculty are more comfortable with.  
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size—prefers small classes such as 10-15.  
b.	Clinical groups—N/A
c.	Online—has not taught online previously but is willing to learn.  Thinks he could catch on very quickly.
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy—feels that statistics can often be scary for students, but very willing to explain complex analyses in simpler terms.  Wants to help his students understand and overcome fear of “math” in using statistics. 
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Very interested in clinical research topics.  His background is in health policy, so interested in doing work in that area or in area of social science research questions.  Also very interested in moving forward in the area of program evaluation. 
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
N/A
11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
(a) In his past, Dr. Bai has no previous experience teaching  in formal classroom courses as the director of the course, but has provided occasional guest lectures about statistics, SAS, STATA, data management. He has also led discussion groups of students and faculty about data analysis and data management.   Informal teaching has included one on one statistical consultation with faculty or PhD students. 
(b) Dr. Bai has had no grants submitted or funded as the PI, but would like to do this in the future.
(c)  Dr. Bai has been on no PhD student committees as committee member or Chair.
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Although Dr. Bai has strong positives in his experience with multiple high level statistical methods, knowledge of multiple statistical software programs, and background in clinical medicine, I would recommend no further recruitment efforts at this time due to his lack of teaching experience, lack of independent research, and lack of publications regarding those higher level statistical methods.</Comment>

She does have teaching experience in statistics/ math. Has taught 3 courses (2004-2009), and online (2009-2010). Worked as lab instructor/ TA 2005-2006). Does not appear to have done any teaching during her post-doctoral training period.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

No mentoring in CV, but that’s to be expected given her junior status.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

n/a


6.	Service to the profession

Working Group coordinator, and graduate student seminar coordinator. Also Session Chair and Eastern North American REgsion International Biometric Society. Member of 4 professional organizations, no leadership roles to date.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Based on prior discussions about this statistical role, this applicant appears to be very junior. Coming out of a post-doc, this would be her first full time faculty role. She has been employed in statistics at the junior/ entry level, but don’t think she meets the criteria for DUSON current job description for the position. Do not recommend phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :           Judith Adams       			 Position:  FNP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

Candidate has 5 peer reviewed publications, 4 as first author. Very well versed in the Adaptive Leadership Framework, an excellent complement to the funded P30 ADAPT Center. Funded externally as a predoc through NINR and through VA for postdoctoral studies. This will be her first faculty position.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

She has a focused program of research and scholarship in palliative and end-of-life care.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Candidate does have significant teaching experience. I have observed her teaching style in the N230 course the past 2.5 years, and she is an engaging teacher for student learning.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

She does not indicate any mentoring experience on her CV, but this is congruent with her stage of professional development. I believe she possesses the interpersonal skills to be an effective mentor for students.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

She is working to re-establish her clinical practice as a FNP.  I am curious as to when these requirements will be met, as it would impact her ability to teach NP courses? (I’m not sure if this impacts her or not)

6.	Service to the profession

She is a member of 6 professional organizations with service as Board Member for one organization.

7.	Job stability

She demonstrates job stability.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

She will be an excellent fit for the funded P30 ADAPT Center, and brings a different perspective to geriatric care not met by current faculty research interests. She has established mentoring relationships within DUSON as a PhD graduate, which would create a situation for more rapid assimilation to the DUSON community as  a Track I Assistant Professor.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

I would recommend a phone screen, with particular interest in when she will complete requirements to have her FNP license reinstated. I am also curious if her NP status in NC effects her eligibility to join faculty and teach in NP program at this time?</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:  Alexandra Hanlon                                                  			 Position:  statistician
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
She would really like to get more involved in teaching because her present position is on research track and they don’t allow her time for teaching. When she was at Temple, she developed and taught 3 classes and enjoyed it.  She would also like time to pursue her own program of research, which she doesn’t get now. Her present position is mostly on faculty grants and she said in the current funding climate, she works twice as hard to put out a lot of grants as collaborator and doesn’t get half the funding that she had seen previously. 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Answered above.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?
She said Duke has a great reputation overall and in nursing. She said we have a larger group of mature statisticians- she is the  only one at Penn, our school is growing and she likes the south.
4.	What are your strengths? 
She is an effective collaborator, has a lot of energy, has a lot of initiative, and multi-tasks well, is  a good communicator and enjoys her work.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
She tends to take on too much but is getting better in this area. 
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
In life- her kids. In work- she was just promoted to full professor. 
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
She enjoys teaching in person-has never taught on-line. She developed and taught 3 classes at Temple- an intro to biostats class for MPH and MD/MPH students, a multivariate advanced stats class and a collaboration class that taught collaboration for research and scholarship. At Penn- she is developing a scholarship class which teaches the students to present research, write a manuscript, and review manuscripts – small class for 10 MD students. She wants to teach more. She has never taught online. 
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
She does have her program of research and honestly, I couldn’t understand what she said- something like propensity square modeling?? She is currently writing two manuscripts in the area. 
9.	What are your practice interests?
She does consulting with collaborators that she has worked with over the years. 
10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
I had wanted to know if she has ever taught complete courses – and yes, described under the teaching section. I also wanted to know about her current grants- they would stay at Penn and be transferred to another statistician.

Committee member’s recommendation: Continue to recruit- she has excellent experience and is highly qualified. RBK</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
Completed DNP in 2013. Has published one article.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Area of research interest seems to be in dementia however would need to explore that more if proceeds to a phone screen. He states he is interested in collaborating with others in the scholarship area.

3.	Teaching experience 
This is his area of strength. He has provided either clinical instructing (CI) or classroom instructing since 1998 at an Associate’s Degree level. Has been what seems to be the equivalent of course coordinator for 7 years. Has taught theory content which includes fundamentals, nursing process, pharmacology and medical-surgical nursing, at some level since 1998.
Within his application he has included his teaching philosophy and reveals that he has a strong background and understanding of teaching the adult learners.

4.	Mentorship experience 
None specifically mentioned.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has maintained FNP clinical practice since obtaining degree in 1998. Would need to clarify his roles in the listed positions, however he has had a broad range of experience including long term care, oncology/hematology, HIV Primary Care/Urgent Care. His most recent job as an FNP appears to be in long term care.

6.	Service to the profession
Has maintained membership in several organizations such as NLN, American Federation of Teachers, Wisconsin League for Nursing, STT, AANP. He has participated in multiple committees within this teaching organization and has chaired many of these. 

7.	Job stability
Has good stability as an instructor (has been at the same school since 1998). He has changed his practice level jobs approximately every 5 years. Not certain if these are within the same health system.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
He has strong teaching background in the area of adult health and foundations. He is an active FNP with a broad range of clinical experience.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
Experience with mentoring undergraduate students.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

I recommend a phone screen. Dr. Rice has a great deal of teaching experience in the fundamentals, pharmacology and med-surgical nursing area. Although he teaches at an associate’s degree level, his clinical practice and experience as course coordinator are appealing.</Comment>

Teaching-learning scholarship, has developed new courses including simulation but has not disseminated beyond local

3.	Teaching experience 
Extensive undergrad and grad, classroom, clinical and on line

Applicant :        James Rice          			 Position:  ABSN AH/ Fundamentals


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

No funding in CV, and has three publications as first author. His cover letter mentions his DNP project, but that does not appear in his CV either. Finished DNP in 2013.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Unable to evaluate based on his CV.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

No evidence of mentoring in CV

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Clinical experience as NP. His cover letter appears Gero focused, which we would definitely help the group teaching the fundamental nursing courses in the new curriculum.

6.	Service to the profession

He has served on Board of Directors for STTI chapter and Wisconsin Board of Nursing.

7.	Job stability

He has long-term care experience, and gero psych experience. Appears to have been gainfully employed consistently.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

Geriatric and gero psych backgrounds (though not highlighted well in his CV) are great experiences coupled with the fundamental nursing teaching experience. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

What are his thoughts on developing a program of scholarship.

No mentorship evident on CV

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Appears to have worked in pediatric clinical settings.

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:  Judith Adams                                                  	Position:  FNP
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term: integrate into position, academic environment; Long: achieve tenure, further research, continue to build research program; become the best teacher she can become and make a difference in students coming through 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?
Have relationships with some faculty a t Duke, did PhD here; important connections to continue research; great resources to become a great educator/teacher, eg: IEE

4.	What are your strengths?
Excellent teacher; extrovert, comfortable in front of a group; shifted teaching style to more learner centered, teaches in a style that allows students to critically reason ibn the classroom; stimulate in class learning; 

Excellent scientific writer; excellent editor; invited to the editorial board of nursing research; good researcher

5.	What are your weaknesses?
Not a “fan” of grant writing but is good at it, does not enjoy it; tends to be impulsive, not asd good at thinking things through, has to remind herself to slow down and process, synthesize info.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Getting through the PhD program; did well in a challenging program, received the distinguished dissertation award

7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size: has taught mostly large classes, 70-80 studetns; comfortable with this size; imagines she would enjoy a smaller size
b.	Clinical groups: ELNEC to nurses and MDs in hospitals; hospice staff on pain management, heart failure, smaller groups; supervised FNP students in 1998 at UNC-A; prefers classroom teaching
c.	Online: none
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy: constructivist: adult learners learn best when they are engaged, active, have their creativity triggered; role of the teacher is to facilitate this, not just spew facts; tries to engage students in problem solving, group learning; not simple information transfer. Tailors teaching to who students are and what they need.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
PhD: studied the perception of family members on strategies nurses used to communicate about pts who were not doing well. Post doc: define optimal role of nurse in communicating with family members in the ICU; this will lead to intervention to optimize nurses’ communication

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? N/A

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
½ day per week in palliative care unit at the VA. No NC NP license; does not qualify, still needs to complete required clinical hours: 400 hrs. Work in the VA will fulfill this; will not have this completed by July, will need 1 day/week practice in order to finish the 400 hurs needed

Certification by ANCC as an FNP (national certification)

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Additions: Asked by hospice and [palliative nurses association to complete leadership training; received research and scholarship award from same org.
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: 
I recommend we cease recruitment. She has good qualities, seems dedicated to teaching and also to a thoughtful program of research but is not licensed as an FNP in NC, needs 400 more clinical hours so she would not be qualified to teach if she starts in July.</Comment>

<Comment>Telephone interview: May 1, 2014

Applicant:          Jill Brennan-Cook                                        Position:  ABSN-AH

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? 
Short term: Become comfortable in a different academic environment. Her current ABSN program is marketed toward working students. She realizes our program and students will be different.

Long term:  Improve her pedagogical skills and engage in more scholarly work. Dr. Brennan-Cook acknowledges with her current and past very heavy course load and teaching responsibilities it has been difficult to engage in more scholarly work. However, she expressed a very strong desire. We discussed the Institute for Educational Excellence and she was very enthusiastic about working with them. She would also like to engage in some research. She tried to initiate a pilot project last summer with students. The aim was to engage students in using a pedometer and recording diet and study activities. She spoke with passion about this project and would love to be able to start this up again with more focus. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position, and why now? (If they are currently in a position)  Husband has been commuting for 4 years and lives in Raleigh. They have a family and children are in NY with Jill. It has become too much and Jill is now ready to move and very excited about the possibility. 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Jill contacted Dr. Zychowicz about a potential faculty position. At that time, a position was not posted. There was a simulation staff position available. She decided to go ahead and apply because she really does want to move to the area and loves simulation. She actually interviewed for the position and was on campus last week. Another individual was chosen. In the interim, this faculty position became available and she is applying. She has also met and spoken with Margie Malloy and another faculty who strongly encouraged her to apply for this faculty position. During her visit, she was very impressed with DUSON and the faculty. She feels DUSON has a lot to offer including being a very strong program and the faculty seem open to new ideas. 

4.	What are your strengths? 

A.	Very organized. She discussed that you can set the bar high if you are organized and very clear with the students regarding your expectations. She believes in being clear and consistent.  
B.	Enjoyed teaching fundamentals this past year. She discussed her strengths as being a very dynamic, enthusiastic and excellent educator. She states she is comfortable teaching any course. She incorporates her extensive clinical experience into her teaching. I was most impressed by this statement: “You must realize you essentially work for them, you are never better than them”.  She believes in teaching from a caring and compassionate standpoint. 
C.	Team player, works well with others, willing to try new things, open up, energetic. 

5.	What are your weaknesses?  Naïve, too trusting. Not always politically savvy. “I just do the work.” She gave an example of others taking credit for some work and large projects she did.  

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?  I have been able to do whatever has been asked. She described their program as being small originally and then the program underwent rapid growth. She was asked to take on new courses and responsibilities. She felt she was always very successful in these tasks. 

7.	What is your teaching passion? Love getting in a classroom, identifying with the students, and making sure that they learn.” If you see blank faces, you are not doing your job. I like to engage students.” Engages students, become an active learner. Own part of the learning process. Telling stories about clinical scenarios and bring back to the message. Her passion and enthusiasm for teaching was so evident.
A.	Class size: stats: 30:1, but 110 students in skills with 4 sections, 3 instructors. He is responsible for coordinating all instructors and students;  25 students come to the lab every day. 
B.	Clinical groups: 8 students to 1 instructor. In her clinical settings, she usually takes the primary responsibility for working with the students. She has students in the long term care setting, often with only 1 RN for the facility. She also works with RN’s on the unit as well and sometimes the RNs take more responsibility for the students. 
C.	Online: Have taught fully online nutrition course for RN’s. Comfortable. Still likes face to face better. Understands need setting everything set up correctly and anticipate student needs with an online course. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?  “If you look at my CV you will see there is nothing there”. She expressed a strong desire to have some program of research, mostly educational research and publications. She has been unable to find time; currently in addition to teaching she has 50 advisees this semester. Her interests are in evaluating  student learning and outcomes, the way we teach. She would like to start pedometer project again. She also facilitated a student research practicum over the summer and enjoyed it.  

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? Did not publish due to lack of time.


10.	What are your practice interests? Still love the clinical setting and have had strong role. Love working in the hospital, she is a RN, not NP and does not have a particular desire to have a specific faculty role. But, she is very interested in maintaining her practice in the clinical sites with students. 

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. Mentoring, 
Strengths: Student mentoring: many, many: MS program, have hired many past students as clinical adjunct faculty and faculty into the role, 12. 
Weaknesses: 
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: Definitely bring in for on campus interviews. I spoke with her for over an hour and had a wonderful conversation. 
1.	She has extensive experience with ABSN students both in the classroom and in the clinical site.
2.	Very strong clinical background
3.	Has taught online
4.	Incredible enthusiasm and creativity and a clear passion for teaching
5.	Very flexible and open to teaching whatever is needed

8.	Values and respects students
9.	An excellent fit with the DUSON culture.

Approximately 18 yrs clinical experience, taught in ABSN program x 12 yrs, experience as ABSN Program Chair X 2 yrs.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
•	What is your vision for ABSN program going forward?
•	What is your leadership style?
•	What is candidate’s plan for obtaining funding and pursuing scholarly activities?
•	What are examples of candidate’s progressive leadership responsibility?
•	Any examples of managerial experience?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Applicant has 18 years of clinical experience. Also 12 yrs of teaching experience with broad knowledge of the ABSN curriculum at DUSON.  However, all clinical &amp; teaching experience at only one insititution, lacks strong evidence of nursing scholarship as the job description states. Also lacks a strong track record of progressive leadership responsibility as is preferred in the job description. Outside of the applicant’s 3 ½ yrs Asst HN &amp; HN experience, there is very little evidence of managing other employees.  This is a very difficult decision about a valued colleague, but I would recommend ceasing recruitment.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :  Valerie Sabol            			 Position:  ABSN program director


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
Not much funding,  more donated time to various projects including Mealtime symptoms in dementia: Adaptive leadership approaches (NINR funded, safety officer, donated time); Measuring Entry-Level Nurses’ Self-Efficacy, Attitudes and Knowledge Related to the Care of Obese Patients (STTI funded, PI, 1% effort);   Incorporating Obesity Education into the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum (DUSON CATALYST award, co-PI).
                                                                            
2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Anemia and nutrition in nursing home residents; focus now seems to be on nursing ed in care of obese patients; no clear path of development in research or other forms of scholarship (eg: SoTL)

3.	Teaching experience 
Most experience in graduate curriculum, acute care advanced practice; not much experience with BSN curriculum aside from work on clinical simulations with ABSN students; no evidence of preparation in teaching-learning principles or adult education beyond what she did as part of advanced practice degree but this is not highlighted in the CV

4.	Mentorship experience 
Lots of experience with DNP students; Has probably also mentored faculty in role as specialty program director at U of Maryland; is currently the elected chair of the MSN program

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Critical care experience as a staff RN and as acute care NP.  Most experience in advanced practice role rather than at RN level; clinical leadership as ACNP; broad expertise in acute care of adults and older adults

6.	Service to the profession
Good service record; Reviews manuscripts for several journals. Memberships in lots of orgs with board and committee positions. 

7.	Job stability
Good, no issues

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Experience as a specialty program director and as MSN program chair; 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
Why are you interested in this position? What experience have you had working with pre-RN students? What is your leadership style/philosophy? What experiences have you had managing a pre-RN program (ie: familiarity with CCNE and BON regulatory requirements)?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Shows some evidence of progressive leadership in academic admin settings, has been a specialty program director but no evidence of preparation in teaching and learning principles for adult education; minimal experience teaching in undergrad, pre-RN program; I was not able to open her cover letter and do not know what motivates her to pursue this position as she seems more focused on advanced practice; recommend holding on further recruitment until we see how the pool develops.</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
Dr. Pate does not appear to have research funding. She has published many papers and been a book editor.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Unclear

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs: 
Dr. Pate is currently the program director for the Clinical Nurse Leader program.
Dr. Pate has only been full faculty since 2012. However, she also taught as adjunct faculty for several other years. It appears as though she has taught mainly in the CNL and DNP programs.  Dr. Pate leads the Clinical Nurse Leader program, however, this is very different than leading our ABSN program.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs
Successfully chaired 3 DNP committees.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Extensive clinical practice as a PNP.

6.	Service to the profession
She has been actively involved in AACN and other professional organizations.

7.	Job stability
Acceptable. UAB and Oregon

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – Not a good fit for the ABSN Program Director position.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
1.	Discuss your role in the Oregon Consortium for Nursing Education.
2.	Discuss your experience in teaching ABSN.
3.	Discuss your responsibilities leading the CNL curriculum.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Cease recruitment. I do not believe Dr. Pace has the experience required to lead our ABSN program.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:        Carolyn Robinson                                            			 Position:  ABSN PD

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term: Personal life change and current opportunity at DUSON is tailor made. Husband is retiring. Long term goal has always been to move back to the Triangle. Carolyn grew up in NC, lots of friends family. Professional: use strengths in academic life. Current position is an excellent match. 

Long term goal: Combine her strengths of administrative leadership skills and love of pre-licensure students. Also has a goal to get back to doing some research. She is not currently at a research institution. She looks forward to forging new collaborations and conducting inter-disciplinary research. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Current position was “made for me”. She knew she wanted to move back to the Triangle and emailed Janice Humphries to see if there would be any open positions, prior to the position being posted. When she saw the position, she said it was tailor made. Carolyn has had extensive leadership experience in SON as described below (Strengths). The current position provides an opportunity to excel and use her leadership skills and love of ABSN students.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  The position is tailor made and Duke has a fantastic reputation. She would like to collaborate with faculty both across DUSON and the campus.

4.	What are your strengths? 
1. “Bring people together to produce results. Listen, to both sides. Fair, open minded, and make a decision. Don’t dwell on decisions. Clear on expectations for faculty members. While we are concerned with student outcomes, it requires using individual faculty for their strengths, empowers faculty. If they enjoy what they are doing we will have the best student results”. 
2. “Important to have a healthy academic work environment” As a leader she believes in role modeling a healthy, positive environment. She is a TEAM person. Others say I am “wise and intelligent”. Proactive vs. reactive. 
3. Extrovert – Enjoys meeting people and going out to represent the school in public, being the voice of the school, program. 


5.	What are your weaknesses?

Things have changed across the years in academia. “It is always a challenge to deal with a dozen issues at one time, however, this is the new reality. The challenge is to successfully, thoroughly, and effectively manage these dozen or more issues”.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Thousands and thousands of nursing students who I have taught and role-modeled (including doing patient care, research, translational research) who are now providing great patient care and higher achieving higher degrees. 
7.	What is your teaching passion? Community, occupational and environmental health
a.	Class size: up to 128
b.	Clinical groups: up to 10
c.	Online: yes, most classes hybrid
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy – “I will do the best I can to make teaching fun and engaging as possible. Make the student responsible for their participation.”

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Environmental, occupational health and agricultural health. Open to working with others on other topics. “I would want to assess what the needs are in the region to guide research in this  direction to meet the needs of the population in NC”. Her most recent work was in clandestine meth labs, solids and waste water, developed surveys to assess public perception of environmental health risk. Has done work in risk communication and the identification of true health risks. 

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? In the administrative role her practice would include service projects with students, leadership projects, and volunteering with community events. She can supervise community and public health students. She is not a NP.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Why the recent changes in employment and how long were you a Dean?
The Dean opportunity (n=800 students) fell into her lap and she feels she made a big contribution. She felt she was very successful in the role and really enjoyed the opportunity. Her original path was as a researcher, however she transitioned from a research career to administration with this opportunity and really loved it. She was in the Dean role for 2 years when the School opened a 2nd campus much closer to her home; she was commuting 2 hours a day (one way) while Dean. She volunteered to step down and help get the new programs up at the new campus. In this role, Director of Knoxville Region for Nursing Programs, she was able to help get these programs started (further description below). She was in this role for 4 years [Directing MS (FNP, Nurse Educator, Administrator), RN to BSN (6 campuses). There was then turmoil at the University and the President was given a no confidence vote and forced to resign, no confidence vote. During this time Carolyn felt an ethical dilemma. She then took her current position in Knoxville with the understanding it would be for one year. She knew her husband would be retiring in a year and she would want to move back to NC. The Dean at this school understood and asked her to take her current position and help mentor some of the more junior faculty. In the past year she has focused on teaching a lot of pre-licensure students and really loved it. While she has taught them in the past, it had been awhile and she felt re-energized with this experience. She has previously taught RN-BSN for 7 years, also taught PhD and MSN students. She really enjoys teaching students with a previous degree, and nursing, was a GEL MS.

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet        

May 9th, 2014                                             

Applicant:          Donna Ryan                                    		Position:  AH/ Fundamentals

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Stated short-term goal was to obtain her first faculty position. Long-term goal was to develop skills in all aspects of being a full-time faculty (but said she wasn’t exactly sure what all was entailed with being a full-time faculty member). She also wants to pursue certification as a CNE.
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Most of her time at DUSON has been as a Project Coordinator, transitioned to clinical faculty as funding ended and also worked as a teaching assistant. Has worked as a TA in Adult Health and Leadership courses with DUSON faculty. Also has online experience. She wants to stay in the area and continue to teach.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
She has been co-teaching in DUSON AH class, has been at Duke and is interested in staying here.
4.	What are your strengths?
Teaching in other courses outside of her pediatric experience has been helpful , and has taught her that peds content is applicable across the lifespan, that there are many overlaps. She thought it was an easy transition from peds to AH. Feels she is flexible, and has a diverse clinical background. She feels she receives feedback well as a CI. Feels she is a lifelong learner with DNP.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Limited experience with item-writing, but has graded papers with rubrics. She took a class this past spring with an expert in item-writing. Developing her comfort level with classroom teaching of new content, but says she has been told this can take 3-4 times of teaching the same content to achieve.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Graduating last May with her DNP.  Her capstone project was published in April 2014. She has been re-elected to the Neonatal Nursing Association, and she is proud of the ABSN students set to graduate this weekend. She has been with them since they started and proud of their achievements.
7.	What is your teaching passion?  **Struggled to actually answer this question, and after several minutes of talking, asked me what the question was again.
A.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy

She is interested in the literature related to bridging classroom and clinical content. Content across class/ clinical/ lab needs to be better organized and not so challenging. Classroom faculty often not in clinical to share information. Was an online student, but prefers classroom sessions, and not just lecture. Wants to help students apply class content in clinical.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans? (**framed as scholarship with clinical track position)
She has published her capstone project on congenital heart disease screening. Has ideas for publishing other manuscripts from that data. She is also interested in nurse incivility both in clinical settings and academia, faculty and students.
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
Published in april 2014.
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

She has not practiced clinically in many years. Keeps up to date on neonatal nursing and leadership.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:  She seems like a very nice person, but had difficulty answering the question asked at times, but kept talking. Then she would ask me to clarify. I could not tell if this was because she was nervous or not. At the end of my questions for her,  I asked her if she had any other questions for the search committee and she did not have any, but rather launched into a 5 minute elaboration on her service work highlights. Candidate is currently working with other DUSON faculty, and is a member of our community. I am, however, inclined to not proceed with further recruitment.</Comment>

Asked about funding since there was nothing in his CV to address this other than awards and scholarships.  Had to ask him 3 times to get the answer that he has had no funding.  Asked how he planned to obtain funding and he said by being mentored by senior faculty.

Asked why he initially applied for the ABSN fundamentals position and later relayed that he would like to be considered for the adult health position also.  Replied that he felt he was a match for both and that he was flexible, had a “hunger and thirst for Duke” and would do anything the school needed him to do if he could secure a position here.  

Committee member’s recommendation:
Considerable teaching experience in various venues.  Will need mentoring r/t obtaining outside funding.
Bring to campus to assess teaching style and ability to communicate and be understood r/t his accent.</Comment>

<Comment>1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short-term goals going from experience at Georgetown to understand how curriculum works and what students get throughout the curriculum.
Important to know how a particular class fits into the overall program.
Understanding more about students themselves—type of students at Duke; sometimes 2nd degree students have a clear goal given this is their secondary career

Long-term understanding what resources are available to deliver content in a way that’s meaningful and to help students really grasp concepts in a fundamental way—avoid them focusing on a skill/task instead of the ‘softer skills’

“As an instructor, let’s take a little bit of a risk” to innovate and build content 
	Right now teaching pediatrics, but always go back to fundamentals—
	In health care, we can be slow to adopt new things---different opportunities --- ex:  using Google glasses to see what patients see when you are 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
n/a-currently instructor, not faculty at Georgetown
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Had a good experience working with accelerated BSN students, so really like and appreciate being around strong students who expect and want high quality---and are open to innovation---that seems like the type of student at Duke. 
Also opportunity for research and collaboration at Duke;
Population in South is of interest;  interested in working with Hispanic population which is prevalent in NC
Collaboration with the hospital is a strength of Duke---hospital at Georgetown is not owned by university, (Medstar) so there aren’t the same opportunities and linkages.  Have had great opportunities with local D.C. Clinic and Children’s National Hospital, not Georgetown’s hospital.
Interested in community linkages—sees more potential in Durham
4.	What are your strengths?
Teaching----both at the academic setting as well as a CNS---seeing how students learn at not only in the clinical context, but at the foundational level in the academic setting.  Making sure students don’t focus on the task and really focus on the concepts
Worked as a psych nurse and critical care, ED, transport (peds and adult)---lots of variation in what I’ve done clinically and that has been very helpful.  
Had great mentoring relationship with a lot of students---what likes most about her position as instructor.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Work oriented;  tendency to work very hard and many hours; hard to “turn things off”
Some areas haven’t done a lot of teaching---done lots of clinical setting, leadership, simulation and lab, general skills, but other areas that she hasn’t taught---e.g., public health, home health
Publications-working on her first post-phd publications;  so focused on teaching, so haven’t published.  Have pub on second round of revisions—first pub out of dissertation. NOTE: this pub was not initiated by HER, the editor contacted her to publish.  Another manuscript under review at JNR, a third under preparation.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Completing her dissertation study as sedation is something that she’s been interested in since the 80s.  
What she’s been able to in developing innovative teaching strategies.  Multiple patient scenarios, discussion boards, using policies and procedures from actual hospitals, trying to help students discuss how to work through errors, etc. Also see google glass example above.  
7.	What is your teaching passion?
A.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy
Understanding the “emotive part” of care---the patient is a person—could be your mom, sister, etc., responsibility of the student to do the absolute best that you can do---memorizing is not enough.  Philosophy of what it means to take care of patients---many students particular terrified of caring for children (and their families);  Understanding not just the physical illness but all of the rest that encompasses that person.  Background may be PICU---erroneous assumption that that ICU environment does not mean fully engaging the family—in fact, it is the opposite…safety is about this, it is not the checklist.  Want students to get the big picture.
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Main interest has always been safety—dissertation focus has been sedation; most of work at UVA focused on safety and quality; this is why simulation is a big area of interest for her; most recently involved in interdisciplinary safety and quality experience.  Simulation in relation to improving sedation safety. 
Secondarily interested in health disparities; work with Beth on rural health care and Latino population.  
Interested in HSR---Duke has infrastructure to support HSR research---such as data repository, data managers, etc.
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
n/a
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

Depends; currently her clinical area is the sim center—9 hrs of sim per week currently this semester.  Open to the opportunities-have taught in ambulatory care settings as well as inpatient.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
 
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Very strong candidate for a Track II position in the ABSN program. Recommend visit for Track II, not Track I
Rationale is the answers to questions above.

<Comment>Applicant :    Cynthia King              			 Position:  ABSN program director


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
Many books and book chapters, fewer articles; CV lists multiple internally funded projects, few, if any, related pubs. Was senior director and nurse scientist at a nursing research center 2003-2007. 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Oncology, quality of life and palliative care seems to be the main focus, but also lists many disparate projects that may reflect her work as a consultant or research mentor for other nurses. Has a good amount of work consulting for pharma industry in pain management.

3.	Teaching experience 
Lists extensive teaching in undergrad and grad programs, classroom, clinical, online. Most recent experience is in managing 9 on-line programs and overseeing 55 faculty members; “Improved quality, standards, policies, procedures; Initiated Team building, team meetings and processes; Actively involved in change management, project management, as well as marketing and advertising; Oversaw budget, revenue almost $4,000,000” but this position lasted only one year. Most extensive experience has been as a faculty member (Professor) at Queens University in Charlotte (2008-2013) and as a research and editorial consultant (since 1990).

4.	Mentorship experience
Lists 12 student research committees on which she was a member but the extent of mentorship in this role is not evident

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Has worked as NP, CNS and nurse scientist in hospitals

6.	Service to the profession

7.	Job stability
No issue

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Experience with academic teaching and leadership as a consultant; clinical management in a research center. Seems to have varied experience in academic and clinical nursing education and will bring the practice perspective that is very valuable in the role of program director since the ABSN works closely with clinical partners.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
What does the current position managing the on-line programs involve? Is she responsible for evaluating course and teaching? Mentoring and developing faculty? What is your vision for ABSN educaiton? What curriculum redesign has she been involved in?


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Recommend phone interview because candidate has background in academic and clinical nursing education and has had leadership &amp; management experience, has done team building and program development and evaluation to some extent. Has experience in curriculum design with CNL program.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :  Maria Orisini                			 Position:  Psych NP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity. 
No research funding or studies listed on CV. Publication history seems to be limited to non-refereed journals, or papers. 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
No focused program of research. 2012 dissertation focused on medical errors of nursing students.

3.	Teaching experience
Taught for 10 years at a community college in an associate degree program- medical surgical and mental health courses.  

4.	Mentorship experience 
Advising for associate degree nursing students.

Not any explicit service listed to the profession, but has collaborated and worked on hospital committees. 

7.	Job stability
Good job stability

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Her expertise does not seem to be a good match for the position of psych NP. I do not see certification as a NP listed anywhere on her CV nor is there a degree listing as a NP. I also don’t see where she has practiced as a NP. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
Lists experience with research and IRB protocols as PI but no dollar amounts. 1996-2001 lists self as Sr. 
clinical research scientist at Glaxo – there are no pubs r/t this work.
	Publications
3 first author pubs (none data based, one book chapter, one review article, one gen info)
  		6 second author
	Posters x 3

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Do not see own program of research. Appears to be involved in dermatologic studies and lists self as principal investigator: 3/5 studies had data presented, 1/5 submitted for pub, and 1/5 currently on-going.
 
3.	Teaching experience 
Intro letter says teaching experience focused on adult education at UNC hospital. Do not see anything r/t education of nursing students at any level including precepting.

4.	Mentorship experience 
No information.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
2010 to date, APN in burn center, UNC
2007-2010: nothing listed on CV
2003-2007: RN in burn center, UNC
1980-2004: RN with various positions (9)  

6.	Service to the profession
Lists 5 affiliations with national organizations. No information r/t role or service within those.
Past service on P&amp;T committee. Currently on advanced practice council at UNC.

7.	Job stability
11 positions in 34 years; 3 are one-year

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Dermatologic care specifically with burns and reconstruction

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
1. Clarification r/t funding
2. Define teaching experience – what in your teaching experience qualifies you to teach in the AGNP 
     program?
3. Discuss national, state, and local service to the profession.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Board certified and currently practicing ANP with newly minted DNP. Service and scholarship limited from CV/cover letter. Need clarification r/t funding, teaching experience, and professional service to proceed.

Position announcement states, “Two to three years’ experience teaching at the graduate level and experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations is desirable.” This candidate has no experience teaching any level of nursing student.

<Comment>Applicant :             King	     			 Position:	ABSN Program Director  


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
This requires clarification. There are multiple funded grants (amount unknown) however it is not clear if these are her grants or students. The CV has some spots where grants and publications are in progress however it was in 2005 so clearly has not cleaned this CV. Nonetheless is well published.
2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Focus on quality of life and pain? Multiple areas of interest on CV; again not sure if these are students or her body of work.
3.	Teaching experience 
4.	Have taught &gt; 15 different courses/clinicals at BSN, MSN, NP, and doctoral level and examples as listed below:
Pharmacology (at BSN, MSN, NP levels), physical assessment (at BSN, MSN, NP levels), Interdisciplinary Health Leadership, Community Health, Nursing Theory, Nursing Research (BSN, MSN, NP, doctorate), Adult Health I (NP), Adult Health II (NP), Professional Roles, Scholarship Activities (RN-BSN), Leadership (BSN, MSN, NP, doctorate), Financial Management (all graduate levels).

5.	Mentorship experience 
Has mentored new faculty. Has served as committee member or advisor for ~12 students at all levels including Masters, PhD and DNP)
6.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Appears that she has not practiced clinically (adult NP) since 2001
7.	Service to the profession
FAAN, Grant reviewer, served as associate or chief editor of multiple journals, multiple roles in the National Oncology Nursing Society, member of multiple oncology organizations	
8.	Job stability
Many positions &lt;2 years. There are a couple that she has stayed 4-5 years.
9.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Has a broad area of knowledge and experience. Has 
10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
Address the job stability and also how she would focus her administrative experience into this role. Why interested in this role beside relocating to this area.

<Comment>Applicant :        Renee Edkins		 Position:  Adult NP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

	No funding reported on her resume. In addition, it is not clear if she has published (or submitted for 	publication) her DNP capstone results. She has 3 poster presentations listed, her publications are either 	book chapters or review articles, difficult to tell if they are peer-reviewed publications or not – all do 	seem related to her content expertise.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

	Focused program appears to be burns, burn reconstruction, &amp; treatment for scarring.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Burns/ burn management is a small focus area, so it depends on what this position needs. If we need more primary care experience, this candidate is not a good fit. If we need specialty experience related to burns or critical care, the fit is better.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

No mentorship listed on her resume.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

DNP graduate from 2014, Duke’s DNP program.  Has worked as a Adult NP since 2010, primarily in burn reconstruction. Clinical experience is related to critical care, but spent 1991-2004 in clinical trails. 


6.	Service to the profession

	Resume states primarily an affiliation with 4 organizations, and as a Fellow in one. She has served on two 	hospital commitees, but unsure of duration.

7.	Job stability

Has changed positions a lot, but all appear to be either related to clinical trials, or critical care.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

I’m not sure that we have a strong need for a burn specialist on faculty.  Many of her presentations were based on “IRB protocols”, but difficult to tell if any of this data informed her publications.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

Moving from clinical trials back into clinical practice with a Masters, what were her reasons for pursuing the DNP? She has teaching experience in clinical setting, but unsure if this is with staff nurses or advanced practice nurses. Will need a lot of support to develop into faculty role.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would not recommend phone screen.  Cease recruitment.</Comment>

<DateOfComment>2014-06-29T00:00:00</DateOfComment>
<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage (summarize)
Track 2: Adequate. There are track changes in her letter (tenure track to track II)
Finished PhD 2013. PhD program Organizational Leadership. Dissertation topic: Qualitative study of perspectives of factors influencing job satisfaction of nurse educators in Maryland. It does not appear from her CV that she has any funding or she has published any data from her dissertation.  She is a co-author on a JAMA  publication in which she participated as a clinical site coordinator for a large multi-site trial. She has developed CD’s and I believe wrote a book on ECG’s. However, her CV is a little hard to interpret. She included a section “Creative Works”, with a sub-section “Publications”. In this section she lists presentations, CD’s, workshops, and “Necessary ECG”, which, I believe is the book she edited. The citation is unclear and incomplete. 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: Her “Creative Works” are very clinically focused and an excellent match for the AGNP focus (physical assessment, ECG’s, etc)

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs: Dr. Kellerman taught in a Community College from 1986-1996. In 1994, she began her own CEU company, “Educational Enterprises Inc.). She has a wealth of teaching experience in national and international forums with a strength in the delivery of continuing education. Her formal teaching in formal schools of nursing is somewhat outdated. She does use a variety of methods to deliver education including online and in person.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs – Not addressed in the CV.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Certified as adult and gero NP –FAANP. Has maintained a clinical practice as a NP. This is a strength. 

6.	Service to the profession: none listed on CV

7.	Job stability – Has owned own company since 1994, but always held a variety of other positions

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – Teaching physical assessment, pharm, perhaps patho. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Yes to phone screen. I think it is important to clarify how much she wants to formally teach in the program, and how much she wants to develop CE through DUSON. 
1.	You state in your letter you wish to explore the opportunity to offer CE’s through DUSON, per conversations with Dean Gilliss and Dr. Zycowicz. Please discuss what you envision this would look like, and how it would affect your business.
2.	The position is in the MS track teaching NP’s. Your last formal position with a SON was in 1996. How would you envision this full time position affecting your business?
3.	DUSON requires both scholarship and service. Can you discuss how you believe you have contributed to these areas thus far in your career? What are you goals for continued development in these areas?</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :         Maria Orsini        			 Position: Psych NP  


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage (summarize). Dr. Orsini completed her online University of Phoenix EdD in 2012 and does not have any publications from her dissertation. She does not have any funding.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship - None

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs: No match. She taught as an instructor in a Community College for 10 years. Dr. Orsini essentially functions in a CNS position for a VA ED, although she holds an educator title.


4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs. None formally noted, but in her functioning role as a CNS I am confident she has mentored many staff nurses. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice – Not a match for the position. She is not certified as any type of NP.

6.	Service to the profession – Some community service, no professional.

7.	Job stability - good

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – none for posted position. 

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  No phone screen. She does not meet the position qualifications as a NP. We could discuss whether or not she is a candidate for a ABSN faculty position.</Comment>

Applicant:        King                                            			 Position:  ABSN PD
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Mentor the next generation of nurses; students or other faculty especially junior faculty
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Left last position and have been in academia previously and enjoyed it. Would like to stay in academia; enjoyed teaching  and the administrative role.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Dukes reputation; high quality; international reputation. Duke and this area; lost her husband and would like to be here in this area where her support systems are.
4.	What are your strengths?
Leadership since 1987 and proven herself as a visionary leader. Excellent mentor,  team player.  Likes to get others perspective whether faculty or students. Strategically someone who collaborates well but also works well independently. Very organized.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
High expectations for herself and works to try not to impose those on others.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Being recognized as FAAN. Makes her feel she has done some good things related to nursing in her career and her peers recognized her for those.
7.	What is your teaching passion? Leadership, administration, financial management research and EBP. Teaching NP courses and CNL courses. Developed CNL in Queens. Taught at all levels and topics and feels very flexible in what she can teach.
a.	Class size: 30 or less. Has taught up to 68
b.	Clinical groups: 8-12
c.	Online: Up to 50 but this is not ideal for discussions or interactive things you can accomplish
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy
Student centered; make the courses what the students need and in the format they need. Knowing these things change over time; understanding the need to be adaptable to those needs. Knowledge, critical thinking (applying knowledge) and curiosity (cyclical). Create a safe environment for student learning; using adult learning styles. Student centered; allowing them to have a voice. Key goals as an educator: foster critical thinking, facilitate life-long learning; help students EB clinical thinking.
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Quality of life; oncology; symptom management. Would like to look at QOL in other chronic conditions.
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Certified prior to 2005 so was grandfathered into not requiring certification. Currently does not actively practice.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Various short term positions:
Asked to do things that were not her strengths. Husband became ill at one point and died; administration had changed significantly and the new dean was not as supportive. Moved to Maine with specific goals in mind and the goals identified between her and the dean were very specific. That Dean was let go and the program changed and everything that she came for had changed and they let her resign to allow for someone to apply that was in line with the model.
Focus of administrative talents: Most are transferrable although some are unique to academia. Team oriented; likes to work with groups and teams; discuss things with faculty and get different perspectives. Understands there are times that as a leader you have to make independent decisions and she is comfortable doing that but likes to be collaborative. Regular meetings with faculty allowing them to make the agenda so the most important thing to that faculty member is addressed and then additional items she would like to add can be done so afterwards. Team meetings with agendas put together from all team members to promote collaborative environment.

Additional Questions for ABSN Program Director Candidates:
1.	What administrative experiences do you have running a program in a school of nursing or other department?

Extensive since 1987; multiple settings including hospital, pharmaceutical settings, running her own consultation business and schools of nursing.
9 online nursing programs (1500 students, 50-60 faculty and 8-10 staff). Editor for international journal 

2.	What experience do you have with designing curricula in a school of nursing or other department?

Involved in designing new curricula and programs UNC Charlotte (CNL curricula and sat on program for ABSN program) and Queens and ST Josephs

3.	What would be your philosophy as director of an ABSN program? 

ABSN programs are good opportunity or method to bring new into nursing. Students tend to have higher expectations for themselves and faculty may not have these same expectations. The focus often times on GPA and due to their maturity the students, faculty tend to respect diverse backgrounds in different ways and should try to bring those backgrounds into ways of knowing and relate those to nursing. Promote comfort in sharing previous experiences with others.
(Focused here on what type of students we have and why they are in the ABSN program. Could not get her out of this direction despite prodding).


4.	What has been your commitment to diversity and inclusion?
Both in clinical, education and administration. Very attentive to various types of individuals including ESL, ethnicity, ages, religion. Ensures to help those in terms of their learning to find resources needed.
Recent at St. Joseph: Created a relationship with the Philippines to have Filipino students complete the NP program; site visits overseen by their faculty.
5.	 How might your previous diversity and inclusion efforts (and philosophy) enhance the ABSN program?
Would work to enhance diversity by reaching out and networking with different groups and areas (i.e. churches and community centers). Recruit more individuals from rural areas. Part of the director’s job to network with businesses that may support their employees in taking 16 months off to complete the ABSN program to return and benefit their business.
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
I would recommend a campus visit based on our discussion. There were some weak areas in terms of philosophy for the ABSN program director position and also in diversity. She also is only interested in 12 month appointment which is worrisome with her history of various short term positions. 
What I feel she does bring is an extensive history in administrative roles in academia and other business areas. She has experience in mentorship of students and faculty, a great history of working with students and faculty on research projects and publications. She was very personable over the phone and was interested in our needs.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :    Wanda Hilliard, MBA, MSN, APRN, PMHNP-BC        Position:  Psych NP


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
Currently DNP student at UAB with expected graduation of May 2015.  No mention in CV or cover letter of any research funding or research experience.  Her cover letter mentions two publications, but CV only has one publication in Jrl of Correctional Hlthcare &amp; one “pending”.  Not sure if that means under review or in press.  Ms. Hilliard’s cover letter also mentions she has written a chapter in upcoming Psych-Mental Hlth textbook, but does not name the textbook or provide dates.  Her CV lists four Scholarship/Fellowship awards, but unclear amounts or whether received funding or awards were just acknowledgements.  CV lists one international presentation and “numerous poster presentations &amp; lectures”, all at one APNA meeting at UT Arlington, TX.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Has an MBA &amp; background as CPA for 15 yrs, but graduated with BSN in 2003, MSN Family/Psych NP in 2010.  Last 4 years has worked as Psych NP in private practice clinic setting, Crisis clinic at tertiary med ctr, and also 1/5 yrs experience in prison setting all in Houston, TX. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
CV states Adjunct Clinical faculty since 8/13 at TX Women’s Univ. Cover letter explains that this position has been with both undergrad &amp; graduate nursing students as clinical preceptor.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs
None mentioned.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Past 10 yrs of clinical experience in peri-op, neurology, pulmonary, house supervisor, and psych-mental health settings.  Has practiced as Psych NP since June 2010.

6.	Service to the profession
Publication reviewer for Mosby, Psychiatric textbooks for one year, 2009-2010.

7.	Job stability
Averages about two years per job listing on CV.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Psych NP clinical expertise.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
•	What teaching experience, other than clinical preceptor, do you have?
•	What are your plans for disseminating your DNP project?
•	What are your plans for future funding and scholarly activity?
•	Applicant mentions a preference for an online position; does that mean she is not willing to relocate to NC?


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

I think that we should stop recruitment for this applicant because she is at least a year away from completing her doctorate and has very little teaching experience.  She is certainly welcome to reapply once she has finished her doctorate.  I would also clarify with her if this position necessitates living in NC or is flexible as to whether she could do the job living in Houston, TX.</Comment>

<Comment>Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:           Marye Kellerman                                         	Position:  AGNP (adult gero NP)
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Pursue a FT faculty position, while keeping the business on a back burner. Dr. Kellerman really would like to pursue at FT faculty position at this point in her career.
Short term goals: 
1.	Integrate as a FT DUSON faculty members
2.	Start research program on NP graduates, investigating the predictors of certification pass rates, and factors that affect retention in the NP role.
3.	Conduct outreach work into the community through the churches. She has done some work and program development in this area before, in poor neighborhoods in Baltimore.
4.	Determine how she could assimilate her teaching style to DUSON. Still likes “humanness” of education. Would like to help work with faculty. 
Long term goals: publish, grant write, more research in how the brain learns and how our patients learn. Possibly pursue the CE initiative discussed with Dr Gilliss, at some point. (see discussion below)

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
“I want to give back, I’ve done a lot, I have a lot, but I am a teacher”. The candidate discussed this at length. She is at the point in her life where she really wants to pursue teaching in a formal academic position. The discussion was very frank and genuine.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
“At Duke I could do even more, and I could collaborate with brilliant colleagues. I want to be better, and a stronger teacher”. Dr. Kellerman is very dedicated to improving her teaching skills and methods. She believes Duke is a strong environment with resources and colleagues that can facilitate this goal. 

4.	What are your strengths?
Ability to convey tough material in a simplistic manner, scale it down, great speaker, can excite, motivate, interaction with students is beyond the classroom, interested in students as persons. Student advocate.  Strong dedication to diversity. She has had excellent experiences teaching in a historically black college and working with students and patients from under-served areas. She is very proud of the accomplishments she had during this time in her career.

5.	What are your weaknesses? Very busy person. Sometimes need to take time for myself. Grant writing skills are weak.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment? “Getting my PhD while husband was ill and eventually died.” And  “ I have helped students turned away from other programs due to low GPA’s, GRE’s. I worked to help nurses at Coppin State SON become NP’s and MD’s. Worked a lot with low income nurses.  Taught at historically black university, low resource environment, lack of clinical sites. 

7.	What is your teaching passion? Helping the student learn. Dr. Kellerman has a very student centered approach to her teaching. 

Between her company and years as faculty in a SON at Coppin, Dr. Kellerman has taught in a variety of settings, nationally, and Internationally, using a variety of teaching methods.
a.	Class size – 200 face to face and small 10-20, 75, workshops 10-500, individual tutoring
b.	Clinical groups – Clinical coordinator at Coppin, did clinical placements, site visits
c.	Online – CEO of company, and develop online products. Blackboard, developed 2 online programs.
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy – “Student centered, dynamic, an interchange between student and faculty. I learn from my students to teach better. Learning must be active, more than reading. Respectful, exemplary, so students should want to mirror behavior and role, caring”, 
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
a.	Start research program on NP graduates, investigating the predictors of passage rate on certification rates, retention in NP role.
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? Depends on role and what it involves. Currently maintains practice 1 day/week in underserved area in Baltimore.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

You state in your letter you wish to explore the opportunity to offer CE’s through DUSON, per conversations with Dean Gilliss and Dr. Zycowicz. Please discuss what you envision this would look like, and how it would affect your business.
Been in CE business for 20 years and clinical practice. Dr. Kellerman identified a gap in 2 areas: 1. NP’s out of practice and want to go back to practice. 2. As more states are requiring pharm hours, there is a great need for CE in this area, beginning nurses, CRNA’s, NP’s.  She believes there is an opportunity to start a program at DUSON to develop these areas and tap this market. She understands at this time DUSON is not quite ready. If there was interest in the future, she would be able to lead the development of this program. However, at this time, she clearly understand the scope of the posted position and this is perfectly acceptable, now and in the future.

2.	The position is in the MS track teaching NP’s. Your last formal position with a SON was in 1996. How would you envision this full time position affecting your business? 
“I will be putting my business on the back burner. I can “tweak” speaking engagements and schedule these around campus required activities. I usually travel on Friday-Sunday. Friday meetings would be hard.
3.	DUSON requires both scholarship and service. Can you discuss how you believe you have contributed to these areas thus far in your career? What are you goals for continued development in these areas? 
“At Coppin started an inactivity program. SON agreed to start “Coppin Stopping Inactivity” – SON and community started to get involved. 
Become more involved as a FAANP. Member of Maryland Nurses Association and has conducted free workshops. 
4.	Describe your specific teaching experience other than teaching outside a licensing exam.
	Didactic clinical assessment, pathophys, disease management, exams, Blackboard. Dr. Kellerman has had a wealth and variety of teaching relevant to the position.
6.	How do you continue to practice as NP? Usually 1 day a week, African American morbid obesity with DM, osteoarthritis, medicare and Medicaid. 
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: Recommend campus visit and continue recruitment. This is a very strong candidate with a wealth of knowledge and experience who is ready to make this career move.</Comment>

Applicant :        Brandon Respress		 Position:  Psych/ Mental Health ABSN


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

RN since 2000, is completing her second post-doc. CV lists publications in preparation (2 as first author); under review (5 – 3 as second author; 2 as first); 1 revise and resubmit; one book chapter as second author; and 2 publications as first author.  One independent/ PI research funding to date (UROP), but has been a T32 recipient. 10 national presentations/ posters.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Scholarship/ Research area around adolescent mental health issues/ pediatrics; social determinants of health and health disparities; risky behaviors in adolescents.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Worked as clinical faculty in BSN program at Case Western 2005-2009; Online lecturer for Thomas Edison State College and fundamentals course at Case Western, and University of Michigan.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

She is seeking her first faculty position – however, most of her training indicates she might be a better fit for a tenure-track position, and I think this is a clinical track position. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

She has a post-Master’s certificate as a Psych NP, but I do not see a work history that reveals any clinical experience as a NP. CV only lists RN (traveler) 2000 to present. Professional experiences mixed in with work history.

6.	Service to the profession

Has served on Curriculum committee (Psych NP); has served as journal reviewer, several boards related to her program of research and/ or professional nursing organizations.

7.	Job stability

Even with her postdoctoral work, she has gained teaching experiences in the classroom and online based on her CV. Not sure how much clinical practice she has done since 2009. And its not clear if the teaching she has done was primarily her responsibility, or if she was working with other faculty as a TA. Teaching experiences are not listed under employment history.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

Has a great background in diversity, has the psych mental health degree though does not seem to have a strong clinical background in this area based on her CV.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

Is she interested in tenure or non-tenure track position? Does she plan to practice/ want to practice as a Psych NP in Durham area?  With her teaching, were these TA experiences or was she responsible for course?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would recommend phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>
Brandon states that he ‘integrates key principles of mental health and public health into pediatric nursing care’ and his CV includes multiple presentation and publications (two published, several under review) that support his having a great deal of experience in teaching about mental health and at-risk and underserved populations.  However, it is unclear what his current clinical practice is or if he intends to maintain a clinical practice.
It is unclear how much clinical experience he has with mental health nursing – but he does have a mental health focus to his teaching experience and scholarship.

<Comment>Phone Screen:
Applicant:     Wanda Hilliard, MBA, MSN,  APRN, PMHNP-BC        Position:  Psych NP

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term goal---now that I will soon have my DNP I want to focus on using that degree to become Assistant Professor in academic setting and teach NP students as well as maintain my clinical practice as Psych NP.  Long term goal—interested in continuing to advance in career teaching Psych to students, developing new clinical programs like her current clinical practice in an acute psych walk-in clinic, doing research with clinical practice issues involving the community, and beginning to work globally with other countries introducing new clinical programs there.
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Applicant is going to soon finish DNP and interested in putting degree to work by being an Assistant Professor versus an adjunct who has students in clinical setting.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Interested in working with colleagues and students at a highly rated nursing school with similar values to hers.  Applicant&apos;s priorities are excellence in teaching and clinical practice and feels that DUSON values those priorities as well.
4.	What are your strengths?
Strengths are five years of clinical experience in a psych setting, being open-minded &amp; embracing change, being a life-long leaner &amp; always open to learning new things, &amp; being flexible and open to new challenges.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
“I’m probably too over-enthusiastic at times and can take on too much.” 
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Being part of team that was awarded $16,000,000 grant to develop 4 acute psych walk-in clinics to better manage patients with acute psych problems by directing them out of ER &amp; into these free clinics which offer txmt protocols that help pts seek chronic care in community.  Applicant&apos;s roles include, as the first person hired for this project, development of all psych txmt protocols &amp; policies; hiring staff, including MDs; ordering meds; &amp; providing direct patient care.  The first &amp; only clinic is now open in Houston but they have plans to open a total of 4 in other areas of town.  She expressed working as part of this project as a “dream come true”.
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size—no experience teaching in classroom to large groups---occasionally does guest lectures to max of 40 students.  
b.	Clinical groups—where most of teaching experience lies is in clinical practice setting and less than or no more than 12 students is best for good group interaction.
c.	Online—has never taught online, but has been student online X 2 years during the DNP program at UAB.
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy— teaching philosophy is very student centered.  She enjoys helping students better understand the world of psych patient care and psych pathophysiology.  She feels students should be given support to develop independence and good clinical skills—she strongly believes students should be given tools to help them be successful, but does not believe in “baby sitting” or “spoon feeding”  students.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Her research interests include: to continue focusing on use of genetic testing in patients with psych problems to see if genetic knowledge changes outcomes, or use of genetic testing data in managing patients with addiction, or use of international models of care tested in U.S. or international settings.  
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
Meet in March 2015 with committee at UAB for proposal defense and discussion of manuscript for publication.  Plans on graduating in May 2015 &amp; intends to publish at least one paper from her Capstone.
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Yes, definitely wants to maintain practice.  Clinical practice (working with both students and patients in clinical setting) is most rewarding part of her practice to date.  Certified by ANCC as Psych/Mental Health Family NP, so she can manage all aspects of the health of adult or pediatric psych patients. In her position in the prison, she managed care of psych patients by providing both medical and psych care (Rx, referrals, ordering testing).
11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
•	What teaching experience, other than clinical preceptor, do you have?

Has never been faculty of record for course or course coordinator.  Has years of clinical teaching experience with students &amp; in last 5 yrs has included jail or psych clinical settings, and occasional guest lectures in classroom.  Mostly has worked with undergrad students, but has also had some MSN Adult health/family NP students in clinical setting as preceptor. 

•	What are your plans for disseminating your DNP project?

Hopefully will publish results of Capstone project entitled, “Does the Utilization of a Genetic-Driven medication protocol for patients diagnosed with Treatment Resistant Depression in the outpatient setting as compared to Traditional medication treatment without genetic testing reduce depressive symptoms on the Beck’s Depression Rating Scale within a six-month time period?”  Has plans to discuss manuscript preparation with her advisor &amp; committee at UAB in March 2015.  Plans to file IRB paperwork in March &amp; start data collection after her proposal defense scheduled in March 2015.  So feels she is on target to graduate from UAB in May 2015 with DNP.  Has two semesters left (Fall 2014/Spring 2015).

•	What are your plans for future funding and scholarly activity?

In process now of writing proposal for $20,000 grant for pilot study to cover Capstone project.  Working with committee to draft proposal.  See Question # 8 for future research ideas. 

•	Confused about your publications based on your cover letter &amp; CV.  The two seem to conflict and want to clarify.  

One paper published (on CV but incomplete citation) in Jrl of Correctional Healthcare.  She was first author, but cannot find citation for that online in Pub Med or google search.  Also one chapter, Stafford L. &amp; Hilliard W. “Advanced Practice in Psychiatric Nursing” in textbook, Advanced Practice Roles (2014).  Hauppauge NY: Nova Publishers.  

•	Confused about your awards—were these recognition awards or monetary award for research or scholarly projects?

Applicant has received multiple awards –some were &amp; others were not listed on her CV.  Leadership award -$1000, local STT Chapter award-$1000, Janssen Pharmaceuticals--$1000, others ranging from $300 to $3000.

•	Applicant mentions a preference for an online position; does that mean she is not willing to relocate to NC?
When I asked applicant to clarify her request for an online position (from cover letter),  she explained that because her husband is Masters of Divinity student at SMU in Dallas, and she has just opened the first of 4 acute psych clinics in Houston (&quot;my passion&quot;), she would prefer to stay in Houston.  She did say she would be happy to come to DUSON “when necessary”.   However, when I told her that this position would require the faculty member to be physically present on campus &amp; live in the area, she said that they would be happy to do that as well.  I reinforced that at the end of the call as well as at the beginning.

Other questions to me from applicant:
•	She asked about whether her teaching assignment would be a psych course in the Family NP program or several courses in a Psych NP program.  She also asked to hear more details about the VA &amp; DUSON collaborative project mentioned in job description.  
I told her she would have to ask Dr. Merwin about her specific course assignments if she was invited for an on-campus visit.  But that as I understood it, she would teach a psych course in the MSN Adult Health/Family NP program because we did not have a Psych NP program at this time.  She asked about the course title &amp; I looked on the sample MAT plans for Adult/Gero &amp; Family &amp; did not find any psych courses.  So told her I’d have to get back to her about that.  I also told her that I did not have the specific information about the VA position at this time, but would get back to her next week.

•	She asked about the opportunity to teach a leadership or a genetics course in the MSN or DNP program since she has MBA &amp; also her Capstone is focused on genetics.
I told her I did not know that information but that she could talk to the Executive Vice Dean about that if she was invited for an on-campus visit. 

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
I feel that there are several options for this applicant depending on Administration’s plans for curriculum changes or development of new programs:
•	We should stop recruitment for this applicant because she is 9 mths away from completing her DNP.  She is certainly welcome to reapply once she has finished her DNP.  We do not currently have a psych course that she could teach in the MSN program, so not clear on what the need for a psych NP is currently with our MSN curriculum.  Although she said that she was willing to relocate, she is very involved with development of the acute psych clinics in Houston and her husband is in graduate school at SMU.  
•	If there is a new program being developed with the VA-DUSON, we need more information about that program before we continue recruitment with this applicant for that program.  Or maybe that program will be developed &amp; started by the time this applicant finishes her DNP?  In that case, maybe we should continue recruitment of this candidate who has 5 years of psych clinical practice in a variety of settings.
•	If Administration is developing a new Psych NP clinical program, then perhaps this applicant should be invited for an on-campus visit to pursue a faculty position in that program?  Perhaps that will be timed to coincide with the date that this applicant is graduating with her DNP?
•	To be discussed at our meeting Monday, August 4th.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone Screen #2:
Applicant:     Wanda Hilliard, MBA, MSN,  APRN, PMHNP-BC        Position:  Psych NP


1.	Explained to applicant that our policy is to hire faculty with completed doctoratal degrees.  But when the applicant is currently in doctoral program &amp; close to finishing, we feel more comfortable if we have a specific date for your final defense.  Do you think you will truly finish in May 2015?  If so, what is the date for your final defense?

Applicant feels that even though she is yet to submit to the IRB, she will really finish in May.  She has done her proposal defense, has the IRB proposal ready to submit (meeting with her Chair next week at UAB), and is collecting data retrospectively from charts—so data collection will be fairly fast.  She said that her final defense is tentatively planned for mid-March 2015, although she seemed a bit confused about what her project data collection and analysis will entail.  

2.  	Our Search committee was curious why you wanted to relocate to Duke when you are so obviously invested in the free mental health clinics in Houston?  

Although she enjoys her clinical work in Houston &amp; is proud of what she has accomplished, she wants to take an academic position (now that she will have a doctorate) to grow in her career.  She is frustrated by the lack of options for academic positions in Houston related to a Psych MSN program where she could teach.  There are no Psych MSN programs in Houston, closest ones are in San Antonio (2 ½ hrs away) or Dallas (4 ½ hrs away) or Austin (3 hrs away) and all require face to face attendance or physical presence very often on campus.  She feels that they will have to move anyway (see comments about TX options for her to teach in Psych NP program), and wanted to relocate to a place where they can both work on their careers.  Her husband is finishing his Masters in Divinity in March &amp; would love to pursue his PhD in Divinity at Duke.  So this would be a great place.  Husband is “totally supportive” to move if she is offered this position. 

She talked at length about why there are less Psych providers than needed.  (1) fewer MDs are going into Psych as a specialty b/c of the low reimbursement/payment options. (2)  No PA programs include Psych as speciality;  (3) very few schools of Nursing have Psych NP programs anymore, so the demand is much higher than supply; (4) because of the dearth of Psychiatrists, which are necessary to partner with for NP practice, fewer NPs can practice in Psych area.    Huge demand for MSN Psych NP programs online so people can live where they practice &amp; still get NP degree.

3.	I asked for more details of the $20,000 grant proposal she is working on to fund her Capstone project.  Who is the funding agency she is approaching?
She said her Chair suggested she approach the APNA (American Psych Nurses Association) for funds or the International Society of Psych RNs.  She has written the proposal &amp; is meeting with her Chair next week to discuss further.  The money will be for genetic testing, but wasn’t sure what she would do if it was not funded.  

4.  	I explained the details of the VA-DUSON collaborative practice and our HRSA funding for planned Psych MSN-NP program.  She was very enthusiastic about both opportunities and again reiterated how important the Psych MSN-NP program would be if it was online.  She knows many nurses who would love to study for that degree if they did not have to move.

5.  She expressed appreciation of the follow up phone call and stated that she appreciated our careful review whether or not she was asked to come to campus for continued recruitment.  


Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Again, I am torn about this applicant.  Potentially she could be a huge asset with her strong clinical background and enthusiasm about both the VA-DUSON program and the planned DUSON Psych-NP program.  But neither one of those programs are up and running at this time.  And she is still a DNP student hoping to finish in May.  We have a date for the applicant’s final DNP Capstone defense of mid-March, but that seems very fast for a project involving genetic testing.  And that date is from the student’s perspective and not her Chair’s perspective.  Additionally, her project seems a bit confusing as to whether she is doing only a retrospective chart review with some genetic testing later on or then a followup, or the chart review only.  At this point I would say continue recruitment, but is probably worth another call to applicant later in Fall or early Spring to ask about her progress.</Comment>

<Comment>DNP Duke 2012
Applied for position previously. Has since obtained additional teaching experience at the graduate level. 
2010-present – Assist. Prof. Western Carolina U, SON. ABSN and some MSN
2014-present Simmons College SON, Boston, Adjunct, teaching online pathophys
2008-2010 – ANP in Gastroenterology practice
2010-2013 – Volunteer in Medicine clinic

Areas of Evaluation

General Comment: Per the candidates letter, she applied “last April” for the same position and describes a very favorable review. She was encouraged to obtain more graduate level teaching experience. She has sought an additional adjunct faculty position which has provided this, and she has obtained additional teaching opportunities within the MSN program in her current position. 

1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)
Yes. Dr. Sargsyan graduated from DUSON as a DNP in 2012. She has presented several abstracts and has one publication. This is appropriate for her career stage.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: Several abstracts presented and one manuscript published.  There seems to be a focus, though limited, on substance abuse.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs:  Graduate pathophys, research, undergraduate adult health and informatics courses.


4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs: She is now chairing several MSN student capstone committees.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: Somewhat limited as NP. Practiced as NP in a gastro clinic and volunteer in a medicine clinic for a total of 5 years

6.	Service to the profession: President Elect of a Sigma Theta Thau chapter.  Currently a grant reviewer for HRSA grants. Has been involved in school and hospital committees.
 
7.	Job stability: Good

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON : DUSON grad from DNP program. Pharmacology, and A&amp;P, has taught this in the past. Possible IT courses?

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

Please describe your clinical practice experiences as an ANP.


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  
Perhaps review previous evaluations if this is allowed. If positive,  phone screen. According to the candidates letter of interest, she has obtained additional teaching experience at the graduate level as recommended.</Comment>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :  Paula Glass                			 Position:  AGNP faculty 


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity. No funding. One article in a newsletter and one journal article.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: Stated research focus is on cultural competency in nursing education. No extramural funding.

3.	Teaching experience: Has had experience teaching a number of undergraduate courses, and some graduate level courses. Currently holds adjunct faculty appointments at FIU and Nova (Florida). Past Professor I position for 5 years at Palm Beach State College (ADN-RN program).

4.	Mentorship experience:  She has listed undergraduate student “advising/mentoring”, but no individual mentoring relationships with graduate students are mentioned; she mentions “advising” graduate students.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: Practice relevant to role of AGNP, however there is no evidence of a strong area of focus. Has worked in private internal medicine practices, urology, a laser center, and as a women’s health NP at Planned Parenthood – none of these jobs appears to have been more than one year. There is a gap in practice between 2006 and 2014.

6.	Service to the profession: Membership in professional organizations. No evidence of leadership.

7.	Job stability: 5 years teaching at Palm Beach State College. Two years teaching at FIU. Less than one year at Nova. Practice positions have all been 1-2 years.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON: Adult nurse practitioner experience, and teaching experience. Interest in cultural competency. Some experience in women’s health.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities) : She states in her cover letter “Both student and patient populations I have served and cared for in Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, have been composed of ethnically and socioeconomically diversity (sic), as well as multiple primary languages and educational backgrounds (levels enrolled and degrees attained).”  Research focus is on cultural competency in nursing education.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): It is not very clear from her CV which courses (that she taught) were undergraduate and which ones were graduate courses.


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  This candidate does not appear to have a strong area of focus. She has not held a regular rank faculty position at a peer institution. Very limited scholarship. My recommendation would be to discontinue recruitment.

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.  No active research, limited pubs, last was DNP project publication, 2012. 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: health counseling (student health), asthma, primary care 

3.	Teaching experience: nothing full time, has done guest lectures, in 2006-08, he was CI for ANP program as clinical instructor, and curriculum teaching. He also served on the admissions comm.  

4.	Mentorship experience not evident, is administrative clinic operations supervisor in current position. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: entering 10 yrs of clinical practice, including primary care, emphasis on adolescents

6.	Service to the profession no professional orgs. Listed, has volunteered at free health clinics, speaks Spanish. 

7.	Job stability each position seems to last about 2 years, though the current site is 3 years. 

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON clinical background as ANP, Latino connection may be good, but can’t tell from CV/  

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  has Latino connection, has rec’d award in that area 10 yrs ago, adolescent population experience clinically, service to sexual health/has worked on health education materials prior to NP work. 

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):  

Are you fluent in Spanish?  Please tell us about your positions, and what attracted you to them.  Were their any issues we should know about leaving any of them?  (it seems you have not stayed at one site for more than 2 years).  Are you a member of any professional organizations? What are your hopes for a teaching position?  

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  This candidate does not seem like a strong candidate. However, he has wide clinical experience, and I would conduct a phone interview to flush out what his strengths are because of that clinical experience and possible connect to Latino community.

Applicant :        Alex Sargsyan          			 Position:  Adult/Gero Nurse Practitioner


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
1-2013 publication – DNP work?
2 on CV ‘submitted for publication’ December 2013 – no notice of update

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: Unclear from CV – has spoken on predictors of success in pre-licensure nursing and done some continuing education teaching for practicing RNs

3.	Teaching experience 
Previously applied – reports interim teaching activity is with a (synchronous) on-line FNP program at Simmons College, Boston, MA (MSN pathophysiology – Spring and Fall 2014 – only graduate level teaching recently). 
2010-current at WCU (ABSN and MSN-FNP): MSN teaching all with Simmons College recently – MSN courses (Adult health management and clinical – 2011, patho 2012) all the rest of experience appears to be pre-licensure

4.	Mentorship experience:  chair of 4 MSN student research capstone/thesis projects

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Does not have a current NP practice listed.  Was practicing (ANP) with Transylvania Volunteers in Medicine Clinic – end date listed as 2013

6.	Service to the profession
Underserved/rural practice
Grant reviewer for health resources and services administration
Teaches continuing education opportunities for RNs
Local, national and international conference presentations (prelicensure or con-ed focus)


7.	Job stability – 4-years at WCU

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – seems to have more experience with pre-licensure, graduate teaching in pathophysiology and one AGNP management course (2011). Distance teaching experience is one year of synchronous presentation of course to students at Simmons college


9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
-	His practice was in an underserved area

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):
1)	Have him describe his area of scholarship as it is unclear from CV
2)	What is current clinical practice – what are plans for clinical practice
3)	Further describe his role as instructor for the courses he lists – was he course coordinator? Were there multiple sections to the course? How does he manage a course, what methods?
4)	Further describe his distance teaching experience ie. How many students in his distance course? What methods did he use to teach the distance course

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Cease recruitment vs. phone interview:  Though Alex has taken DUSON search committee feedback to get more MSN teaching experience – it seems as though he still lacks depth of development of area of scholarship and MSN teaching compared to other AGNP candidates.  I get the sense from the review of his CV, that he focuses on one area of teaching, scholarship, service at a time – ie. There are several 2013 end-dates of activities/participation on his CV and his focus over the last year has been teaching distance and teaching at the graduate level.
I know Alex – he was in my DNP cohort – and, perhaps this is my own projection of managing the complexity of practice, teaching and scholarship, but I get the sense from the timelines on his CV that he does serial projects – and that still, he has limited masters teaching experience.  Perhaps answers to questions on a phone interview would convince me otherwise, but my sense is the requirements of this position exceed his experience.  Phone interview.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone Screen:

Applicant:     Alex Sargsyan                                           			 Position:  AGNP Faculty
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?    
Short-term: focusing on teaching in AGNP program. Considers his pathophysiology teaching background a strength and is excited to teach APNs. Feels very comfortable with his background and experience that he would be able to teach a variety of the courses in the AGNP program (Patho, physical assessment, primary care, clinical courses, etc)
Long-term: Integrate into the Duke system and expand his area of scholarship – feels as though he’s comfortable with his teaching, excited to collaborate with others and develop his other areas of scholarship.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Seeking opportunity to teach APNs and expand scholarship.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Desires more opportunity to teach nurse practitioners – at WCU he is teaching pre-licensure mostly. Has had to reach out (guest lecture and on-line opportunities) to be able to teach at the graduate level – nurse practitioners.
Wishes to match his clinical practice with teaching.  
4.	What are your strengths?
Clinical background and time-management (clinically and as WCU faculty). 
Clinical teaching and networking with other clinicians to bring clinical relevance into the classroom.
Feels confident clinically – allows him to ‘empower’ the students to bring their own experiences into their clinical practice.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Taking on too many things – tries not to ‘bring work home’. Finding time for himself and other academic or clinical pursuits.
Interested in pursuing clinical and academics – challenged by ‘logistics’ – difficulty with expanding himself with ‘organizing other non-nursing projects’.  Will help with those ‘projects’ but sees himself as a team-member, not a leader of those project teams.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?

7.	What is your teaching passion?
A.	Class size: 
i.	Patho/prelicensure (50 students – on-campus)
ii.	Graduate (12-15 students)
iii.	DNP – one capstone chair
iv.	Graduate research projects – capstone chair of 4
b.	Clinical groups
i.	Prelicensure:  (8-10)
c.	Online: section instructor for distance course – records lectures, finds content to make available for his content area. Facilitates case study presentations each week – in-depth preparation for each case (uses audience response, synchronous similar to ‘go-to-meeting’, student interaction is synchronous)
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy
Empower the students. Mentor them to synthesize all their experiences (formal classroom, and informal) to apply their experience to clinical concepts and their own clinical experiences.
Guide students – not step-by-step leading.  His clinical confidence allows him to be inclusive of all student experiences and show them how to make an impact clinically. 

8.	What are your scholarship/research interests? Program of research plans?
Scholarship of teaching: student successes (currently has spoken nationally on pre-licensure and RN-BSN) would like to explore this at the master’s level. –predictors of success
This current area of scholarship for Alex is part of a project with WCU to review and/or adapt their admission criteria
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A: Currently working on predictors of success in undergraduate education. 
10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Actively seeking clinical position – the volunteer clinic he worked for closed, actively seeking clinical practice opportunities.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
1)	Have him describe his area of scholarship as it is unclear from CV (see above in 8)
2)	What is current clinical practice – what are plans for clinical practice
a.	Not currently practicing – the volunteer clinic closed. Currently exploring practice options.
3)	Further describe his role as instructor for the courses he lists – was he course coordinator? Were there multiple sections to the course? How does he manage a course, what methods?
A.	See #7a above
4)	Further describe his distance teaching experience ie. How many students in his distance course? What methods did he use to teach the distance course
a.	See #7 above

5)	Time management:  Feels as though he’s learned how to do this well – create boundaries between home &amp; work. Even physical boundaries to go back to work to finish something if that needs to be done. 
Planning ahead the whole semester: what his teaching obligations are, project time, clinical time. Setting group deadlines.

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Campus Visit:
Thoughtful answers reflect a current faculty member who is following his professional goals. Would like to teach nurse practitioners and network with other NP faculty. Interested in continuing to develop his scholarship in the area of teaching masters students, predictors of success of the masters student and predictors of clinical success.
He feels going through the interview process last year helped him grow professionally and is appreciative of the push to gain more distance and masters experience. He feels very confident in  his ability to teach in the classroom and this last year has increased his comfort and passion for distance teaching.  He “really enjoys it!”</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Dina Kerasiotis RN NPP Psy.D.		 Position:  ABSN Psych Mental Health


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

Four publications are listed (do not appear to be peer-reviewed or data-based), from 2003-2006 time frame. Doctorate in School-Community Psychology completed in 2001 from Hofstra University, yet no publications related to dissertation or program of research apparent in resume. No grants listed – no evidence of funding for any scholarly work.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

The publications from 2003-2006 reference trauma, loss, and PTSD. No information provided for the focus of her dissertation, but a program of research or scholarship is non-existent. She appears to be a very strong clinician with administrative skills.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

No teaching experience evident from the resume. No experience with ABSN student, and no clinical teaching experience listed on resume.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

No evidence of mentorship in resume.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

This is her strong point. She has experience as a Psych NP, but I do not see a certification through ANCC or comparable organization.

6.	Service to the profession

	She has participated in disaster relief for Katrina and the World Trade Center.  There are no professional 	organization memberships or leadership positions listed in resume.

7.	Job stability

	Seems to have been employed fairly consistently since 1988 as either adjunct faculty, clinical position, research scientist, 

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

	She has a psych/ mental health background, but absolutely no faculty preparation – no evidence of curriculum development skills, no nurse educator preparation, and has a Doctor of Psychology. Her certification is pending and I’m not sure what that means. She would need a lot of support to develop in a faculty role, and would definitely be clinical track.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:

-	what were her specific responsibilities as an adjunct faculty (merely an occasional guest lecturer)
-	What experiences does she have teaching at the baccalaureate level? Clinical teaching experience? 

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would not recommend phone screen. While she has a whole host of clinical preparation, I do not see where she has developed teaching skills necessary for clinical track ABSN faculty.</Comment>

<Comment>I believe that this is a strong candidate and we should move forward with a phone screen.

I, too, had originally been concerned that she had limited research experience- no publications related to dissertation or program of research apparent in resume. No grants listed – no evidence of funding for any scholarly work.

However, I think her extensitve experience (in emergency and psych nursing)  and doctorate in clinical pschology make her an appealing candidate. She also has had several high profile and high-responsibility positions that demonstrates organizational leadership that I think can help her be an effective teacher and collaborator. 

I fully support moving forward with a phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>I am impressed with this candidate&apos;s cover letter and his responsiveness to our feedback from a prior interview. He has extensive teaching experience and has presented his teaching methods and approaches at conferences. He shows potential to be an effective and reflective educator.

Remi&apos;s applicant review worksheet notes that the bulk of his teaching experience is he does not currently identify NP practice.

I do not see any tangible evidence of significant scholarship or concentrated area of interest at this point in his career (2 manuscripts are submitted - journal not specified - but zero accepted), although that is understandable at this early point in his career.  However, based on phone interview summary, his long term goals for &quot;scholarship&quot; seem poorly defined.

I am impressed with his teaching experience, professionalism, and enthusiam for this position, but I do feel that his CV does not demonstrate excellence or significant scholarship or any research, or his ability to commit to research or scholarship in a significant way.

My opinion is that we cease recruitment and continue to explore other candidates.</Comment>

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
States that she has developed a very diverse leadership team *(need more information)
10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):
What type of instruction has she participated in and grant funding. What are her research interests and scholarship. How has she contributed to a diversity and inclusion in her current role.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Has significant experience that will assist in the development of clinical sites and feel that she will be a great mentor and DNP chair. However concerned that there is no documented clinical or didactic teaching experience. Need to address this if moved to phone screen which I would recommend. I would also discuss with either Sharon Hawks or Charles Vacchiano for fit if possible considering she is confidential candidate.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity. No publications; DNP capstone article described as “publication pending”. No research funding in CV. CV states “Grant applications for CRNA research at Duke University Hospital. Supports and partakes in research activities within the Department of Anesthesia at Duke University Hospital (2007 – Present)”

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship: None evident from CV.

3.	Teaching experience: CV states she is adjunct faculty at DUSON. Has taught leadership course in the DNP program. Has lectured and given presentations at various schools and CRNA professional meetings. 

4.	Mentorship experience: Not in an academic sense; strong clinical mentorship potential.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice: Extensive clinical practice and managerial level experience as a CRNA.

6.	Service to the profession: CV states that she has been “Chairman/Host, 2011 and 2012 Annual North Carolina State Chief CRNA meetings”. Memberships in a number of professional societies, no leadership roles. Student representative on DNP program committee while at DUSON, and student council representative for DNP program. 

7.	Job stability: Solid record of stable jobs; been at Duke for 7 years.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON: Clinical teaching in CRNA program and leadership courses in DNP program; CRNA admissions; clinical mentorship; 

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities): Not evident on CV. 

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): Explain your interest in becoming a faculty member; what are you interested in teaching? Do you have plans to pursue scholarship and scholarly writing? Can you elaborate on what grant applications you have been involved with, and to what extent? You mentioned partaking in research activities in Dept of Anesthesia at DUH – what activities, and what was your role? Are you interested in maintaining a clinical practice while you teach? 


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Biggest area of weakness is scholarship. She otherwise is a good fit for the job description and well known in the community (distinguished clinical career at Duke, experience teaching in DNP program, experience with management of clinical sites, potential to engage clinical partners in the development of DNP capstone project partnerships… ability to serve as a DNP capstone chair and/or committee member, has participated in the CRNA student admissions process). Recommend proceed with phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>Dr. Cho finished her PhD in 2005 and post-doc in 2007.  While the number of publications is relatively low given the length of time since graduation, she clearly has a focused area of research and some notable accomplishments.  Her successful R21 and progression to R01 demonstrate that she has the ability to compete for federal research funding, and she also has received another of smaller industry and academic grants for her work. All her funded research does center around the theme of biological mechanisms in neonates.

She does present herself well on her CV - with a respectable list of publications and conference presentations in addition to her funding.  I am not sure of the rigor of the journals or conference venues, but this CV is certainly representative of research faculty, likely at the Associate Professor level. 

A more extensive list of publications would make her a stronger candidate. At this point, I would probably consider her a suitable candidate for continued phone conversations, and recognize that there might be stronger candidates.</Comment>

<Comment>Requirement:  Candidates eligible for this position will have strong potential for developing a program of funded scientific research.  

Assessment from CV:  Ms. Janna Stephens has a promising CV for a PhD candidate.  She has worked on a number of different NIH grants in different areas with 3 different faculty members.  I believe that this will give her a broad familiarity with research topics and logistics.  More importantly, I think she has a clear sense of research and the faculty role. She has an impressive list of teaching experiences in addition to her research activities. 

She lists 5 publications (2 first author) that are in high-impact multidisciplinary journals.  Only one seems to be data-based, but one is a systematic review. Others describe content analysis and theoretical frameworks in CV health topics and seem to be foundational to her proposed program of research. In addition she contributed to 4 conference abstracts and gave 2 conference presentations and a radio tour (!) for her current F31 sponosred research on &quot;Smartphone Use for Weight Loss in Children and Adolescents.&quot;

Ms. Stephens has an F31 award for the evaluation of mobile phone app for cardiovascular health, and to get an award at this stage in her career is very impressitve.  I think she shows great research potential and high likelihood of collaboration with DUSON and Duke faculty in nursing, health promotion, public health, and informatics.

Her coverletter states she will complete her PhD in a few months, which makes her eligible for the position.  I recommend continued recruitment and a clarification of her defense date.</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:   Meri Gilman Mays 10/14/14                                                Position:  CRNA Faculty 

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short-term goal is currently being fulfilled by increasing her involvement in the school of nursing and education of CRNA DNP students. Wanted to get her DNP so that she could pursue teaching. Currently teaching leadership to on-campus cohort of CRNA DNP students.

Long term goal is to teach and help prepare future generation of CRNA; become a liaison between the students and the clinical setting and act as a mentor and facilitator for students who are completing their capstone projects in anesthesia.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? N/A

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Long term Duke fan. Loved going to school at Duke to get DNP. She was very impressed by the quality of her DNP education at Duke, particularly the advice and encouragement of Mary Champagne and Barbara Turner. Emphasized that her Duke education far exceeded her undergraduate and master’s educational preparation.

4.	What are your strengths?
Good track record in leadership role at Duke for past 8 years. Describes herself as resilient, able to work through tough issues and bounce back stronger (emphasized that CRNAs are a tough group to work with). Another strength is ability to multitask and fill multiple roles. Good speaker – enjoys speaking nationally about CRNA change management. Leads by example – 7 CRNAs at Duke have returned to get DNP since she finished her DNP. Deals with conflict well. “And I’m a great CRNA!”

5.	What are your weaknesses?
Tendency to think big, with the 50,000 ft view, which sometimes leads to missing details; as a result has learned to start small. Sometimes struggles with big decisions and second-guesses herself. 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her current role as chief CRNA at Duke. Started with a small “broken” program, grew from 40-150 CRNAs, built a stronger team. Created a 1-year orientation process w/stipend for Duke CRNAs – unique and only one in US.

7.	What is your teaching passion?
Very much enjoys teaching in the classroom with small groups rather than online (has done both with leadership courses in DNP program). Also enjoys clinical teaching; loves taking CRNA students into OR for the first time, and then witnessing their development over time. Believes most effective teachers are those who are calm and encouraging and remain “human”; appreciates a relaxed style of teaching and feels open to criticism and suggestions for improvement.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
She does not have an interest in research and does not plan to pursue a research agenda. She does however enjoy the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based practice changes (DNP role). Currently has seven quality improvements initiatives in progress – this is a direct result of her DNP education. 

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
She has submitted her capstone manuscript to three journals that have turned it down. She has submitted it most recently to the Journal of Perioperative Nursing, decision pending. She describes herself as someone who has “become a champion at attempting to publish!”

10.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Holds certification as a CRNA – must take on 25 anesthesia cases per year to maintain credentialing at Duke. Currently devotes 5% of her time to clinical practice. She would be open to continuing her practice, or not, depending on the needs of the CRNA program faculty.

11.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Asked about participation in grant writing:  She has participated in grant applications for her department, but not as a lead writer. Example was helping to complete application to obtain funding for CRNAs to have research support at Duke (time to work on research projects).
Asked about her commitment to diversity and inclusion:  Diversity and inclusion have been on her “score card” for yearly performance evaluations since she began her role as chief CRNA 8 years ago. She describes attending CRNA conferences as a “sea of white people” which led her to visit 8 different HBCUs to talk to the BSN students about the CRNA role; she offered to facilitate shadowing experiences and gave recommendations to the students on how to prepare for a strong application to CRNA programs. For the past seven years she has met her annual goal of increasing the diversity of her team by 5% each year. 

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
	Dr. Gilman Mays was very confident and enthusiastic in her phone interview. She clearly has a very strong desire to make teaching the next step in her career, and she pursued the DNP degree for that reason. She has a very strong track record as an administrator and leader at Duke, with a proven commitment to diversity and inclusion. She realizes that her lack of scholarly writing makes her a less competitive candidate, and she understands that as a faculty member she would be expected to engage in scholarly practice and writing. She identified the 7 current QI projects that she initiated after finishing her DNP program as potential areas for dissemination. She has a working knowledge of the Duke CRNA program and what is expected of faculty and students, so she would be able to step into the role and hit the ground running. Potential negatives include the fact that three of our CRNA faculty members are Duke DNP graduates, and there may be a need to bring in someone from outside Duke for a fresh perspective, and although clearly passionate about preparing the next generation of CRNAs, she does not have a strong track record of teaching and has not held a faculty position before. However, given the job description below, I feel that she is highly qualified for the particular role, and I would add her to the pool of candidates to invite for a campus visit. Her stated long-term goal of becoming a liaison between the students and the clinical setting and acting as a mentor and facilitator for students who are completing their capstone projects is also aligned with the job description.
	From the posted job description: “The faculty member is responsible for participating in a dynamic faculty role that includes supporting didactic instruction in on-campus and online environments, assisting in the management of clinical sites, and engaging clinical partners in the development of DNP capstone project partnerships. The faculty member will also serve as a DNP capstone chair and/or committee member, participate in the student admissions process, and be responsible for supporting the evaluation of students in simulated clinical experiences.”</Comment>

<Comment>Faculty Search Committee             Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:      KERASIOTIS, Dina                 			 Position:   ABSN Psych

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short: did not get certified initially b/c not required; has just completed review course and is in process of submitting documents to take certification exam.  I asked her to notify Crystal when she had a firm date.

Long: wants to do research and work with doctoral students; happy to work with ABSN students initially with long-term interest to work with either/both PhD and DNP students.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
After finishing PhD she became a single mother with 3 children and needed to work in positions that paid well. She is now at a point in her life that salary is not as important.  She believes her psych skills would be beneficial to students.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke? 
Duke’s reputation is well known.  She believes it offers professional opportunities and that it would be the right step for her at this time.

4.	What are your strengths?
Strong leader that is good with people and is able to work in difficult climates.  She is ethical, stays up to date on new information, and enjoys her work.

5.	What are your weaknesses?
Has some perfectionist and intense tendencies.  Is aware of those and uses this awareness to tone it down when working with students.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her accomplishments at North Shore – LIJ Health System where she expanded quality management and communication within the system.  During her tenure the system went rom 90 to 400 practices.  She fostered safety and managed finances in a difficult financial atmosphere.

7.	What is your teaching passion? Two things: (1) to convey didactic information based on evidence, and (2) to engage the student so that he understands the clinical usefulness of the material.  Believes this would bring balance to the classroom.

a.	Class size: with beginning students 25-30. As the student progresses and the focus in narrowed perhaps 10-12.  Wants the maturing student’s needs to be met.

b.	Clinical groups: ~5 to ensure close observation and be available to offer assistance

c.	Online: has not taught online but has taken online courses and continuing education. Knows what worked well for her and what didn’t and would tailor online teaching to the course and the student’s needs.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Has not had much opportunity to do research as past and present position focuses on work.  She understands the need to obtain funding, conduct research, and publish.  Her dissertation focused on PTSD symptoms in nurses and found a high level of anxiety.  She would like to look further for ways to prevent/alleviate burnout in nurses.  The second area of interest is to help students match their personality with the type of clinical setting best suited for them when entering the healthcare market.

9.	What are your practice interests?
Current clinical practice involves both a day hospital and inpatient psych settings.

10.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
Reviewer comment: “I do not see where she has developed teaching skills necessary for clinical track ABSN faculty”: candidate relayed she taught full courses in physical, social, and developmental psychology as adjunct at Hofstra.  At Adelphi she taught mental health nursing as well as clinically precepted nurse practitioner and nursing students.

I asked if she had any further information she’d like the committee to know and she replied that she is trained in cognitive behavioral work, psychoanalysis, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) which is recognized by the American Psychiatric Assoc and Dept of Defense as a comprehensive, integrative psychotherapy utilized in treating PTSD.

Her questions for me r/t our process and what the next steps may be. 
 
Committee member’s recommendation:

Campus visit.  
Committee/administration will need to decide if certification as psych NP is required.</Comment>

<Comment>I interviewed Janna Stephens today and was very impressed. She is and EXCELLENT candidate for a tenure track faculty position. She has strong and demonstrated research and teaching and scholarship. She applied for a Junior Researcher position, but her intent was for a traditional faculty position. 

I recommend that we identify a tenure track position for her and move forward with recrtuitment. I suggest we invite her for a campus visit.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)
Research is focused on Hispanic &amp; Asian minority health. Also makes statement in cover letter of her commitment to “promoting diverse and global perspectives in research and teaching”.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
I would include the following questions:
•	If the PI for both of the P20 grants &amp; the R24 is Dr. Wallace, was applicant position on grant a co-PI or project director?
•	Has she ever been funded independently as PI?
•	Where does she see her research going?  As far as next grant mechanisms and research questions.

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?x
Short term: To develop to continue with research plan/program with HIV AA population impact of father/son dyad
Long term: Leadership and/or administration role. Mentor other faculty and lead educational and/or research 
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Has been in education for 11 years and current position since February. Specifically interested in Duke for research around HIV/Aids and enthusiastic about the nurse practitioner specialty and preparing primary care providers to learn how to care for patients which is a highlight for her.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Center for Excellence in terms of faculty and student development. Mission around excellence. Intentionality around faculty development.
4.	What are your strengths?
Executor – if there is something placed before her it gets accomplished. She feels she is reliable and accountable; excels at time management; manages multiple expectations and assignments. Intentional about carving out time for scholarship and self-care. 
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Although strong at building at relationships; how to balance when all team members may not be contributing to the outcome; finds that she will complete the work herself. Focus now on how to find the balance and developing those personnel so they can perform at the expected levels.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Interim Director of Community Engagement – Took the schools strategic plan and developed partnership/collaboration with the hospital and urban ministries (providing education around diabetes (prevention/management). Within a year able to develop those partnerships and begin those services (students and faculty became engaged in those activities once per week).  This  allowed the nursing school to meet that portion of their strategic plan.
7.	What is your teaching passion?
Community and public health. Helping students to see their role outside of the acute care setting and obtain competency in working in the community setting. Taking theory and watching students develop as they learn to apply in the clinical setting.
A.	Class size – 20-25 students but has taught up to 54. Believes in active learning and engaging students in the process which is more effective in smaller class sizes (team based learning; unfolding case studies).
B.	Clinical groups – 8-10 students per group
c.	Online – Developed for community health for RN-BSN program but have not had course that was 100% online.
D.	Discuss teaching philosophy
Educators must demonstrate competency in the teaching/learning process. Educators should be current on information they are teaching. Important to foster critical thinking in teaching strategies.
Encouraging life-long learning; prepared to be competent and skilled. Active student learning strongly encourages positive student outcome. Ensuring that assessment/evaluation procedures are used to determine student acquisition of knowledge.
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Impact of African Amerincan fathers in their son’s sexual behaviors with the goal of developing an intervention that will target African American fathers of pre-adolescent males.
Father-son dyad; biomarkers related to HIV (interested in developing in this area)
Submitted to NC TraCS 2014 (UNC-CH) $50,000 – matching funds from UNC Center for Aids Research and UNC.  Assessment of fathers in their role. Had strong and positive review and resubmitted based on the feedback from her previous submission.
NIHCD health and human development $225,000 – R15 – (Co-PI) Father-son dyad and piloting intervention
If these are not funded to resubmit based on feedback.
8.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A
9.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)

Health disparities expands beyond race and we have to look at the broader picture. Current research which is focused on understanding the contributions of the father/son dyad to adolescent black males sexual behavior.
10.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?
Have done current work with limited resources. Access to graduate students; bio-statisticians; assistance with mock reviews; literature reviews.
Mentorship – networking opportunities; critical, honest feedback; experienced
11.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
Not practicing as staff nurse and currently is focused on her program of research.

What mentoring will she need to apply for an NIH grant? How well-developed are her research questions and will the project be suitable for NIH funding?
Clarify research grants.
Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
She is a good candidate for this position based on the research that she is interested in and also her potential productivity. She would need mentoring in grant writing since she has had limited resources in this area. She has good education background and has a passion for public health which I feel is a great match for DUSON, especially the ABSN program at this time. I see potential in this candidate but would not invite until we have had comparisons/ranking with other candidates.</Comment>

<Comment>Telephone Inteview on 11/14/14:
1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term goal:  Teach psychiatric nursing to pre-licensure students
No long term goals mentioned despite a return to the question
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Opportunity for growth, multiple levels of nurses in training at duson.
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
There is an opening I am interested in
4.	What are your strengths?
Knowledge about psych issues, such as grief , death and dying
she did not mention that teaching was a strength.  
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Havnen’t published, states it’s because institutes where she has worked didn’t have support for it, just a teaching emphasis.
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Earning my PhD
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size:  about 25
b.	Clinical groups: did not answer this
c.	Online: Has been a primary facilitator of an online course, but did not design it. On campus is her favorite.  She likes to “collaborate in the classroom”, “ask questions”, “use storytelling”, “I ask them to share”, says she is not authoritative (in style). 
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy: ” individuals who are unique and with a variety of needs” (should) be given “opportunity for active learning”, they “require a variety of resources “ (for success). Feedback and the environment are  important (such as lighting, comfortable seats, the temperature).  
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
No particular research, could help others in their research.  Thinks post war veteran nursing students are interesting. 
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? n/a

10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  .  I grew up in NC and my grandfather exposed me to multicultural music. She  implied this prepares her for multi cultural sensitivity.  States she has worked with diverse students, both racially and socioeconomically (esp at Walden).Had a positive response about a student with a visual handicap “we don’t know if they will succeed, so we just have to support them”. She was not specific about how to do that. 

11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)? “technology” 

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? Yes, plan to continue “my small practice”. As CNS, she work at nursing homes, visits her clients.  Couldn’t tell me how she billed for her services, seemed not sure. 

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.


Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Generally, I was not impressed from the start. Not much vision, lots of ‘uhs’ . I found myself working hard to draw out information, her strengths, a vision. She likes to tell stories, drops a pedagogical term here and there, but I heard no real vision.  She did not know much about our program.  Her current position is within a set of six faculty, and they were just accredited.  She has not presented at conferences, or implemented any practice innovation or guidelines.  She speaks to church groups.  I did not get the impression she has significant potential for scholarly practice. 
I am also worried the ABSN students will pose questions she cannot answer in an academic way. However, there can be teaching done in storytelling fashion, esp. if it is structured and purposefully builds information and concepts that will assist the student.  I do not feel she is that structured.
My opinion leans towards no further pursuit of this candidate. But, I realize this is an important decision, and would prefer I not be the only word on this for two reasons: I am new at the job on this committee, and it is someone’s career we are impacting. ( I am also aware that we have not been successful with filling the position).</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity. Ms. Liu has 5 publications, including one in press, in what she calls “English” journals and 9 publications in Chinese journals. She has several in review and in preparation.  In addition, she has several poster/oral presentations with one invited presentation.  She has not received external grant funding as PI. In addition, as she states, she has served or is serving as a reviewer for 7 journals in nursing and medicine (e.g., Nursing Research, Geriatric nursing). She also participants as a member of various organizations (e.g., The Gerontological Society of America, The American Geriatrics Society).

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship. Her research focuses on gerontology, cognitive decline, issues pertaining to long-term care and measurement and statistics. For example, her dissertation work is focused on “optimizing eating performance among long-term care residents with cognitive impairment.  Overall, she has been in the role as a research assistant with numerous faculty. 

3.	Teaching experience. Most of her experience has been as a guest lecturer to both undergraduate and graduate students (Masters and Ph.D.).  The areas covered included statistical analyses of quantitative data, measurement and its reliability and validity, as well as the conduct of systematic reviews. She has been involved in what appears to be teaching in training programs, covering such areas as palliative care and dementia care.  As stated in one of her cover letters, she would like to teach research design, basic and advanced statistics, measurement, and the use of various software programs – about which was not stated. No teaching evaluations were provided.

4.	Mentorship experience.  No (research) mentoring experience is mentioned. In service rolls, she has played a role in connecting students with curricula, campus life, and campus resources.  

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice. Other than stating she has an inactive nursing license that is currently being activated, the candidate did not elaborate on her clinical practice experiences. 

6.	Service to the profession.  She is a member of six professional organizations and is serving or has served as a reviewer to 7 journals. There is no evidence that she has served as a grant reviewer.  She is serving as a representative to the Graduate Student Association for the DSO Executive Committee Board and has served as a Curriculum Committee Representative for the DSO Executive Committee Board. 

7.	Job stability. No data were presented as to her various jobs and tenure within each job. It appears that from 2008 until now she has been getting educational degrees. She is expected to get her Ph.D. in Nursing Science at the Maryland School of Nursing in May of 2015. 

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Would contribute to research and educational courses in geriatrics, measurement, and statistics. Her research would also fit nicely with international collaborations with China.  

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities).  She states in one of her cover letters, “I will commit to core values of equity, diversity, and inclusivity by ways of providing my time as required to teaching and teaching-related activities, playing an active role in advising both undergraduate and graduate students, and making an effort to provide high quality educational experiences for the all the students.” What this all means is not clear to this reviewer.   

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):
1.	To discuss more her plans for obtaining external funding both domestically and internationally (e.g., timeline, where, data the person has or needs to submit grants).

2.	What kind of resources she needs to succeed at a researcher and what kind of resources she expects from DUSON.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale: Overall, Wen Liu shows a lot of promise as a researcher. She has been very productive in her early career, and clearly has been involved in many research endeavors, at least as a research assistant.  Would support a phone screen.</Comment>

<DateOfComment>2014-11-19T00:00:00</DateOfComment>
<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity. The candidate has 2 publications and 4 papers in preparation. In addition, she has 3 published abstracts and 14 unpublished presentations – one presentation is in a “other” category which I did not know how to categorize.  She received funding from three external organizations (range $1,000 to $2000) to support what appears to be her dissertation. Among these three, she had to return one source of funding due to changes in dissertation study. She received four honors. 
 
2.	Focused program of research or scholarship. Her research focus is on “technology assisted health self-management and decision making in patients with chronic disorders and their families.” For example, her dissertation work is focused on “factors associated with acceptance and use of mobile technology for health self-monitoring and decision support in lung transplant recipients.” Overall, she has worked as a research assistant in three R01 level projects and one R21 level project. In addition, in terms of educational scholarship, she has developed a 7-module online course in nursing informatics.  The candidate did not discuss her vision to obtain external funding. 

3.	Teaching experience.  Listed in her CV are various didactic courses she has participated in as a teaching fellow from 2009 to 2015 with student composition ranging from 10 to 80+. Most of the courses involved nursing informatics, with other areas covered including: foundations of nursing practice, introduction to basic statistics, methods in technology evaluation and usability, and nutrition for clinical practice.  She lists designing and developing the “methods in technology evaluation and usability” course only. She has  served as a guest lecturer covering such topics as nursing informatics, health promotion and disease prevention. No student evaluations were presented. 

4.	Mentorship experience.  She assisted one BSN study, who was part of the Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program, during the Fall and Spring of 2012. Guidance was provided in the conduct of literature reviews, data entry and analyses, and helping to create a poster. No other mentorship activities were mentioned.   

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice. As stated in her cover letter, her post-baccalaureate work experience has been as a “medical information specialist and a project manager in the department of new drug research and development in a Chinese pharmaceutical company.”  She lists having a nursing license through 2016 (Pennsylvania RN) – among four one of which was as a registered pharmacist in China (inactive). The candidate provided no descriptions of her clinical experiences. 

6.	Service to the profession.  She lists being a member of 8 professional organizations of which she is a current member in four (e.g., American Medical Informatics Association, Society of Behavioral Medicine). 

7.	Job stability. For 2009 until 2014 she has served as a teaching fellow at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Nursing. Prior to 2008, she had several non-academic jobs that last either for a period of a year (e.g., intern for Missouri Rehabilitation Center) to eight years (Joincare Pharmaceutical Group). No specific worries about her job stability. 

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  The candidate would bring strengths to DUSON’s informatics program and possibly research in medical decision making and chronic disease management. 

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities).  The candidate did not outline her views on these issues. She has served as a member to the Institute for healthcare improvement Open School For Health Professions, Pitt Chapter Student Executive Board, University of Pittsburgh and as a student representative to the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Nursing’s  Doctoral Nursing Student Organization’s, Budget Committee.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):
1.	To discuss more her plans for obtaining external funding both domestically and internationally (e.g., timeline, where, data the person has or needs to submit grants).
2.	What kind of resources she needs to succeed at a researcher and what kind of resources she expects from DUSON.
3.	What are her views on diversity and intercultural development. 
4.	Confidence in her ability to defend her dissertation by July 2015 as stated and when she would be able to commence work. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale: Overall, Yun Jiang shows promise as a researcher but would appear to need substantial mentorship. Her number of publications is limited as well as her history of getting funding. Her main area of research, informatics, could be very valuable to DUSON. Unfortunately, she did not embellish on her plans for research and thoughts about obtaining research funding. While I am not highly enthusiastic about the candidate, I think getting greater clarity about her research endeavors would be helpful.  Would recommend phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :        Wen Liu			 Position:  Junior Researcher


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

She has been very productive during her doctoral program with 5 pubs as first author and 7 “under draft” in English and 9 pubs in Chinese; and translated one book. I do not see any evidence of obtaining funding beyond scholarship support. Her letter of interest reports that she did apply for a grant to support her dissertation, but was unsuccessful.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Her research focus is gerontology, function, eating performance, cognitive decline, long term care and statistical/ measurement interests. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Very limited teaching experience, but has done guest lectures and worked as a teaching assistant in a few courses. 

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

She is a PhD candidate, mentorship not evident in her current CV.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

She does not have an active RN license – waiting on a letter from China.

6.	Service to the profession

Has served on DSO committee (not sure what DSO means). Has attended conferences.

7.	Job stability – No evidence of ever having a job in nursing. No clinical experience evident in her CV.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – she has a very close match to my work; and in gerontology/ long-term care would make her a good match.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
-	Has she ever worked in nursing clinically?
-	What courses/ program does she think she would be able to teach in?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would recommend phone screen.</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize).  
Yes, as is PhD student currently at Pitt, with an expected graduation date of May 2015.  Of note is a quantitative methods research minor.  Her prior degrees (BSN and MSN) are from universities in China.  She has 23 total data based pubs, and of these, eleven 1st or 2nd author pubs.  Funding from her old college in China or Ministry of Science/Technology in China, or Doctoral Student award from Penn.  She does mention in cover letter that she was PI of RCT intervention type grant in China.  Her plans for funding are with either AHA, DUSON small grant, or STT pilot grant.  

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Currently focused on behavioral/ lifestyle intervention research using technology for adults with obesity or type 2 diabetes. Integrates mHealth interventions in studies or with older adults having obesity/DM. Graduate research assistant x 4 years with Drs. Lora Burke &amp; Jacquie Dunbar-Jacob at Pitt.  Her research abstract rated very high at recent AHA so doing competitive, interesting research.  

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs
She has 5 years of teaching in China, teaching geriatrics/community health nursing.  Has also been TA for Anatomy &amp; Physiology, patho &amp; microbiology courses at Pitt x 4 yrs.  

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs
None noted on CV or mentioned in cover letter.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
No clinical experience noted on the CV so this is difficult to discern. Unclear if applicant has US nursing license.  Applicant emailed that she is not an NP.  

6.	Service to the profession
Member of several professional organizations.

7.	Job stability
Wants to stay in US after graduation from PhD program.  

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Geriatric/community health nursing.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)
Not addressed specifically in her cover letter or CV.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:
•	Clarify clinical experience as nurse
•	Clarify US Nursing license, VISA, green card status
•	When she would be eligible for NIH funding
•	Her plan for future studies
•	What would she see herself teaching here

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  
Cease recruitment.  Although applicant has excellent quantitative research skills and high long term potential for funding, she is ineligible for NIH funding at this time due to her VISA/green card status.  Applicant is not finished with her PhD at this time, has no current independent funding. Therefore I believe doesn’t meet the criteria for this position at this time.</Comment>

	Does she have any experience with intra-disciplinary simulation (using other APPs or ABSN students in simulation) and/or what are her thoughts on this kind of collaborative instruction
What are her plans for ongoing research and clinical practice?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Phone Screen:  (consider a discussion with Dr. Hawks re: concepts/questions to consider for NAP candidates?)   
This candidate shows a commitment to both her clinical practice and to teaching. Has experience (and has published) about mentoring nurse anesthesia students interested in teaching

Quesiton for committee: 
Position is listed as tenure or non-tenure position - clinical practice (Track 2) or funded research expected? Appears she could be productive with either.</Comment>

<Comment>This candidate does have an impressive list of conference presentations and publications for a PhD candidate.  The papers are in some high impact journals which is impressive.  Candidate appears to have potential as a successful resesearcher in informatics and nursing. Could be an asset and potential collaborator with many DUSON faculty. Candidate&apos;s credentials and interest in Clinical and Translational research might result in collaborations with DCRI, DTMI, and SOM.  Would consider this a strong candidate and recommend a phone screen to determine specific research interest and targets for funding.  (NLM or NINR?)</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

One publication in press. She lists her education as a “Doctorate in Nursing” in 2015 – so I do not know if this is a PhD or DNP candidate, nor a graduation dates

Areas of Evaluation
First: why does CV say Phd 2015 when we aren’t in 2015 yet? Should say expected completion/graduation. 
Next: If earn NP in 2004, why not certified until 2011? Did not pass first time?  Which licenses are active?
Positions:  Student editor of what? Confusing what her NP work was about/anesthesia?  (dept?) /pre op? (later there is reference to Perioperative phone calls)
Why under Invited Presentations do 2 of them say: Attendee? 
Are the 2 postings in 2011 from same trip to Kenya? Why two separate entries?  Just give 
locations/years for presentations to young girls-not sure why so much repetitive entries. 
I am not sure why some categories start with recent and go back, and others start back and go to most recent. Better to stick with one way or other. 
1.	Research funding and publication productivity. None to speak of except for small local STTI chap. 6 mo grant. No pubs yet (1 in print). 
2.	Focused program of research or scholarship –(limited)  Spirituality in young adults with HIV. 1 pub is not same topic: Differences in Caregivers’ Reports of Health Problems and Health Care Use between Maltreated Adolescents and a Comparison Population. Research in Nursing &amp; Health.	

3.	Teaching experience –limited, 8 years ago.

4.	Mentorship experience –I am not sure if you mean they mentored others, or were mentored.  But had 2012 and 2014 Grad. Dean Fellowship and 2013 had NIP T32 fellowship, also, Nursing leadership trainee (adol/young adult ). No mentoring of others except high school presentations. 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice-not clear but seems to have 9 years experience as NP, but overlaps w clin nurse position also. Her cover letter implies lots of experience, the certification date is likely not the original certification date. 

6.	Service to the profession- member for years, and current President of SD Black nurses Assoc., lots of memberships.

7.	Job stability-yes, 18 years as clinical nurse at Sharpe, 9 years at Vista Com clinic. 

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – HIV research, partic. w/ adolescents, spirituality and health care.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  - yes with commitment to black nurses, including student member Diversity in action Comm on faculty diversity. (Free flu clinic service-who did that serve?)

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):  Clarify questions at top.  What are her needs for research and scholarship? What plans does she have for her field of scholarly work? 


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  
I don’t recommend phone screen.  Not enough funding/research/pubs. (unless T32 is significant).</Comment>

<Comment>12/4/2014:  Do not recommend phone screen at this time.

Ashley Schoenfisch is clearly productive and a successful researcher in terms of publications and presentations.  Although she has definitely worked on a number of different grants, her role is usually Epidemiologist (not co-investigator or PI) and so I do not see immediate evidence of demonstrated grant writing or funding. Based on her publication history, I would say that she does have potential for external funding and an independent research career, but little demonstration of this.  
 
Given that we have so many other qualified applicants, I would recommend that we hold on a phone screen for the time being.  Ultimately, I think we would send her a decline letter, as I suspect that other applicants would be more likely to rate as a better fit for DUSON and this Junior Researcher position.</Comment>

<Comment>Phone screen scheduled for 12/11/2014 to clarify the following concerns:

(1) that applicant has not had any apparent independent face-to-face teaching experience of leading a course, so would need mentoring there, not to mention help with online teaching; (2) concerned that the grants she has funded may have been written as team &amp; she does not have those independent skills, but may have been included as team member rather than PI of studies. I am unclear about her roles as RA, co-investigator, vs PI; (3) concerned about plans for future funding.  So feel like a phone screen to get our questions answered would be helpful.</Comment>

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA

10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities).  She is Chinese and is  interested in US-Chinese populations. She is interested in understanding culture with cancer patients, especially the role of the family in helping the patient; the family is very important among those with a Chinese culture. Wants to understand minority needs (Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Chinese-Americans)—for example, family processes and decision making.  

11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)? First passion in your topic of research in order to continue with it. Being able to collaborate with several people (e.g., engineers, clinicians in oncology) and work together as team. Writing is important – because English is her second language, she needs and desires to do more writing.  She also believes in having a long term goal and then try to achieve it step-by-step.  She will need organization support (e.g., from the grants office, small funding, have people to review grants before submission, editorial service). 

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? Has license in nursing. Does not feel she will do clinical practice. 

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. 
A.	Confidence in her ability to defend her dissertation by July 2015 as stated. She feels very confident. Has several abstracts already. Has worked on the data for a long time.

14.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment. Can start a position as early in August. Good for interviews in Spring of 2015. 

15.	Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.? Yes, currently a student VISA

16.	Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.). As she approaches graduation, she will apply for OPT (optional practice training) to continue working.  When she gets a faculty positions, she will apply for H-1B upon job offer and a green card if the organization supports her.  

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:  Yun was pleasant on the phone, and she does have a relatively deep accent. It is clear she is very motivated to pursue research at the intersection of nursing and informatics using technologies to improve health/disease self-management. These interests, combined with her focus on cancer populations can benefit DUSON’s interest sin oncology and informatics. At the moment, she does have some short-term plans about what to do to support her research. She does seem to have some teaching experience and can probably teach a variety of courses (see above). May have some concerns about being able to obtain external federal funding. She will also need some assistance with writing, given that English is her second language. Would consider her to be  a viable candidate for campus visit.</Comment>

He had already built a collaborative research team at DUSON, Duke University and UNC. There are many potential collaborators for him here at Duke, including the neuroscience program and Duke Institute for Brain Science. Has worked with Duke investigators on measuring oxytocin levels continuously.  There are also great collaborations at UNC whose clinical medical program has an emphasis on post-partum depression which is a good fit as they have the population associated with his research.
DUSON is considered a leading institution for nursing research.
UNC is the only U.S. hospital with a dedicated focus on post-partum depression (identification, mgt., and research) and he currently is working there as a clinician building his skills and developing relationships for his research.
4.	What are your strengths?
A.	Knowledge of his biological and behavioral symptoms research area (post-partum depression and post-partum/early childhood experiences; especially in Latino populations)
b.	Ability to create interdisciplinary collaboration and strong group leadership skills
c.	Strong writing skills
d.	Ability to use variable design and statistical methods

5.	What are your weaknesses?
A.	Lack of clinical experience in the U.S. (working on improving this area as he is participating monthly in a clinical experience at UNC)
b.	Limited experience  teaching in the United States
c.	Has not had experience as a course coordinator

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
A.	His recent K99 application which is under review (he pulled together a strong team and support letters)
b.	Two research excellence awards  in Mental Health from Brazilian Nurse Association

7.	What is your teaching passion?
A.	Class size   - ideal class size is 20-30 but could do a bigger class with support.  
B.	Clinical groups  - limited experience in this area
c.	Online   - has some experience with online. Would likely find it more challenging to “engage” students online or have hybrid of online and in person
Discuss teaching philosophy  --(paraphrased a little)  “To help students think on their own terms.  To help them take abstract concepts, big ideas and big aspirations and break them into smaller bits. Help them learn to problem solve and promote intellectual thought.”  He feels it is important to provide a balance and structure for students.  
Possible teaching areas:  
•	Quantitative or Longitudinal Research Methods 
•	Maternal health, family health (including clinical courses)
•	Mental health (has knowledge of anxiety and other disorders in addition to PPD

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Move research to become more complimentary by incorporating genetic and imaging compoenents to current research area. Is working collaboratively with bio-behavioral pilot study with post-doc at UNC.
9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A
10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  

•	His focus of research is on low-income Latino families. He has done outreach and is engaged with 2 Durham community organizations (Durham Connect and El Centro Hispanico) that research out to vulnerable and underserved Latino populations. 
•	His objective is to reduce health disparities in these populations by providing assistance they need to cope with parenting. 
•	Appreciates different perspectives. Multi-disciplinary.
•	Appreciates different backgrounds and is very interested in cross-cultural teaching (at DUSON) and the use of different languages/translation tools.

11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?

•	Access to Bio-behavioral lab (he currently works there to look at oxytocin levels).
•	Observational coding; needs human resources to assist with this. 


12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

He would continue clinical rotations at UNC.


13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

14.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.

Told him that campus visits for selected candidates will happen in January, with notification likely by the end of Dec. 2014.


Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Rachel:
Hold on campus visit to see how he rates in comparison to other candidates.
Hudson is a perfectly fine candidate with great potential for research and external funding success.  Hudson is clearly skilled (qualitative research) and has been well-mentored in his time at DUSON.  Coming from a post-doc position, he obviously has less experience than some of the other junior candidates.  He has submitted a K grant but it has not yet been funded. He has some teaching experience and a number of publications and conference papers (most outside of U.S.)
He could fit well within DUSON but might not be the strongest candidate or match on research interests beyond his mentors here.  Would wait to invite for campus visit until we see if other applicants are stronger. 
Brigit:
While he does require some mentoring, he has a strong base support here and strong collaborative inter-disciplinary teams which he has created. This is a tremendous strength. He has a focused area of research and already understands areas in which he would like to expand and has taken some steps to move in those directions. He is not currently funded but has a K award under review. I don’t see him as weak as the other reviewer and would consider him for campus visit.</Comment>

<Comment>12-12/14:  I had a phone screen with Ashely yesterday and was very impressed with her reported accomplishments - including writing involvment in grants and her articulated program of research and research plans. 
Detailed notes from phone screen are posted in her CV folder. Summary below:

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:   RECOMMEND ON-CAMPUS Visit.  Ashley has participated in writing a number of grants and has received non-NIH funding form a number of sources, and completed those projects. She provided the most comprehensive and well articulated and ambitious research programs I have heard in one of these interviews.  She is also dedicated to her research, and has a clearly defined program of research and incredible enthusiasm. I think she will be able to contribute to DUSON and nursing profession through her research, and can get a quick start since she has been at DUKE SOM.</Comment>

 1.) Process of constant observation (patient attendants/sitters through her violence project but could not find ant literature on costs and risks for them.  The NINR community based research grant is of interest to her and she is starting to write this. Ultimately wants training for this group and how they can 
2.) Set up a cohort of nursing students and follow them after school and a few years after. Wants to look at why they stayed in the field.  Is some work in Swede n to model. Manny Beringie (Duke Occupational Med) is a potential colleague here at Duke. 



Long term goal –
Ashley has clearly identified and articulated a number of broad issues that she would like to explore: 

•	Workplace / workforce Issues with patient outcomes – want to understand more patient populations nurses care for and how nursing workplace safety and violence prevention impacts them.
•	Workforce, particularly the aging nursing workforce population.
•	Wants do to more qualitative research or work with DUSON investigators that do ; she is trained in quantitative epidemiology but everything she does is really mixed methods. So she has some exposure and great appreciation for this.  
•	Wants to explore and promote the strength of observational methods, which are gaining new importance and appreciation with so many EHRs and high cost of prospective research. Because of her training in Epidemiology, she can bring public health perspective to DUSON projects. 
•	Retention  of nurses and impact on patient outcomes and the workforce capacity

Does not want publicity but wants to be known for impact. She wants to make a difference. Wants to be known for making an impact on the nursing workforce and on patients. Most of her research is targeted to and funded by NIOHS, but NIOHS does not fund research on patient outcomes.  She would like to take her ideas and explore other funding sources that would allow her to really look at the impact of different workplace and workforce issues on nurses and patients.

 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position) – N/A

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  

She is currently Asst Prof in Duke School of Medicine (Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Community and Family Medicine). 

Wants to get teaching exposure.  Wants to work in an environment with lots of researchers and commitment to build a work force. Looking for a supportive and stable environment.  Wants a permanent faculty position in a setting that will support her goals for long term research career and to get independent funding.  Wants to remain at Duke but appears to be looking for more stability. 

She has so many community ties here at Duke and UNC that she could transition to Duke seamlessly. 


4.	What are your strengths?

Enjoys writing.  Can write to the reader of the grant.  Another strength is that she is good at seeing the big picture.  E.g., has put in grants that have not been funded and has noticed on reviewer feedback that they do not always see the big picture but focus on a minor detail. 

Also, she is not afraid to say no to projects that are not exactly in her program of research or interest area.  She has been invited to join many grants but she will not do things that do not “fit” her.  

Asks us PLEASE to check her references. They have been great mentors and she has learned so much from them; due to their influence and support she wants to be a good leaders and mentor in the future as well. 
 
5.	What are your weaknesses?

 “opportunities for  improvement”  (lol) 
Does not have a nursing degree.  Though she knows about nursing workforce and context of care and caring.  She realizes that she is “a block away but sometimes a world away” from clinical care settings. She recognizes this and will work to get a better sense of daily nursing practice and issues.

Does not have a teaching component to her job now but she would enjoy expanding her skill set and teach more. Has had luxury to been able to pick students to work with (on guided research projects). She will need mentoring and support from DUSON to be able to work with a broad range of students and manage a full class.  

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?


7.	What is your teaching passion?

Admittedly she has very little teaching experience (only lectures, and some train-the-trainer training) but she wants to gain that experience here at DUSON. She has taught classes as needed.  Enjoys it a lot.  Enoys boiling down hard concepts into smaller chuncks.  And dynamic.

Areas to teach – particularly can do Epidemiology; Special topics in occ health.    - - happy to teach where ever needed or develop a new course in her specialty area.

She is a Certified Instructor of the Crisis Prevention Institute’s Nonviolent Crisis Intervention Program.  (week long course). Focused on how to understand when patients/others becoming agitated and when to intervene in appropriate times.  Perhaps we might want to offer here at DUSON…..


8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?

Safety and health of patient care work force has been her passion for 9 years, and unfortunately there has been little changes.  Violence and muscular skeletal injuries are 2 important focus areas, and she wants to advance her research so that interventions and policies can be developed to impact nurses and patients.


9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?  - N/A


10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  

Most of her work is on vulnerable populations; e.g., poultry workers in rural eastern NC; this has enlightened her about the range of settings and circumstances that people are in. 

Outside work environment – was on a strategic planning committee for her church and did lots of outreach and research to identify  perspectives &amp; needs for her congregation.

She and her family have been part of interexchange group for 6 years. They host student from another country. Au pair program (to nanny kids) but they come a J1 visa as student for cultural exchange.  Has enjoyed experience. Differences in culture immediately noticeable for meals, etc. …


11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?

Has had luxury to been able to pick students to work with. She will need mentoring and support to be able to address the range of student needs/interests, and to manage a full class.  

She has an excellent grants administrator now. Will hope that we have that good research support. 

Looking forward to connecting with DUSON faculty on her research issues.  (Rachel note: Although not formally represented in current DUSON faculty research interests, I think that workforce safety and retention issues are highly relevant to nursing and should be of broad interest.) 



12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

Not a nurse so N/A. 

She has gone to some of Duke’s work training programs. 
Also became a Certified Instructor of the Crisis Prevention Institute’s Nonviolent Crisis Intervention Program. Focused on how to understand when patients/others becoming agitated and when to intervene in appropriate times.  Kind of like a certifications. Has tried to pitch the idea of Duke sponsoring  this training (and her to lead it) to the SOM / DUHS as a Duke course but they declined. Perhaps we might want to offer here at DUSON…..
This was a week long course. Originated from the health care industry (rather than academia). 


13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

14.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.

15.	Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.?

16.	Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.)
(If answer is no to question #15 or yes to question #16 let Crystal know.)



Notes: Interview wanted to clarify her actual grant writing experience. She has written a great number and participated in many (where she is Epidemiologist). Many of her years at Duke were in positions where she did not have responsibility to write grants.  After the interview I am very impressed with her research program and ability to develop new ideas and work collaboratively.  ( I marked up her CV with my notes from her recitation of which grants she wrote and which ones spun off from what. I could not keep up on all my notes.)
She has gotten targeted expertise in gerontology here at DUSON from Kirtsen Corazinni. She looks forward to more collaboration with DUSON faculty on occupational issues. 

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:   RECOMMEND ON-CAMPUS Visit.  Ashley has participated in writing a number of grants and has received non-NIH funding form a number of sources, and completed those projects. She provided the most comprehensive and well articulated and ambitious research programs I have heard in one of these interviews.  She is also dedicated to her research, and has a clearly defined program of research and incredible enthusiasm. I think she will be able to contribute to DUSON and nursing profession through her research, and can get a quick start since she has b</Comment>

Graduated from UNC and is from NC…her family is in NC….would like to return to Triangle. From NC and family is still in the area. Still wants a university.  Is happy at UAB, has good collaborators, open-minded group….but would like to be near family and she has 4-5 potential collaborators at Duke.
Has been working with DHD for past 15 years….they have published together (2008 – 2014)

4.	What are your strengths?
Research and scholarship. Strength is her research, and she would like to be more visible with dissemination….
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Not much time to develop teaching strategy and service.  Would like to explore new strategies for teaching – including gaming.  Rachel described the support for teaching that we have at DUSON.

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Her R01 award.  Funded through 2019.  She completed post doc in 2007 at UNC….R21 in 2010, then RO1 in 2014.  

7.	What is your teaching passion?
She enjoys teaching although admittedly has less experience than desired.  Still she has taught a number of undergraduate and graduate classes at UAB School of Nursing.

a.	Class size   - likes face-to-face and in-class teaching; live is better for her, although most all her teaching experience is online. 
b.	Clinical groups  -- no clinical teaching experience or desire.  
c.	Online  - has plenty of experience
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy   -   She is committed to always provide Fast response on graded student papers and always gives EDITS and COMMENTS .. 
Teaching interests, what do you like about teaching, your philosophy?
Likes both in class and online teaching…..feels in class teaching works better…..likes to do a lot of editing with student work…passion for “in depth” teaching….likes to stay in close contact with students and keeps strict deadlines for responding and giving feedback….feels like students deserve a lot of support and feedback.
No clinical teaching.
Most of teaching has been research courses and stats., and would like to continue to teach those types of courses.
Keeps current RN license, but does not practice clinically.
Has not taught in DNP program – has taught mostly in PhD program.

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Current work through 2019 biochem measurements….developmental delays…..hopes to lead to development of screening tool for infants with a developmental disability, including autism spectrum disorders.
Wants to get an RO1 renewal – multisite. Also interested in autism research being done at Duke (outside of nursing). Would like to collaborate with a particular Duke investigator who has develope a mouse model for autism.
She has focused her career so far on “Show and tell” research to explain disease phenomena, but wants to move beyond Want to do deeper and high impact research. 

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
n/A
10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
She gave a great answer. Her research team has a couple of minority students – enjoys mentoring those students - would like to have cultural diversity among her team – feels it is helpful to “expand her mind and viewpoint” – also feels research participants are more comfortable with a research team that is not all white.
Because of the minority students on her team, she is thinking about writing an NICHD supplement grant to get tuition funds and stipend for minority students.


11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?

Collbarotators.  Has found 2 Med School faculty at Duke. Phys and neonatal/peds.  She sees potential .. 
Needs lab – observational 


12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

When she originally applied for Sr position, she did not know about the Jr. position, so she apologized for the trouble of 2 applications. 

Ideal time frame for relocation to Duke: Expected the date to be August based on the job posting, but she could start couple of months prior to that if necessary. There will be a six month delay in transfer of her grant funds when she leaves UAB. 
Would like to know how many courses she would have to teach….also wants to know what type of research/teaching time split she can negotiate. Her understanding is that she would need to teach one course per semester. Currently she has 45% research time for her RO1 work. Also asked about when she could start mentoring students. She has been a PhD student committee member, but has not served as a chair. 

If she gets a campus visit, will she have the opportunity to meet with potential collaborators?



Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:  
Recommend campus visit.  She has demonstrated independent research funding and has a defined and successful program of research, plus clearly arti</Comment>

(If answer is no to question #15 or yes to question #16 let Crystal know.)


Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Discontinue recruitment. Was not able to articulate very well even when provided with leading questions. It seems that she did not read the position announcement very well and did not have an understanding of the need to be able to have potential fund research at the percentage the position requires. Teaching experience is limited to undergraduate and could not expand on potential to teach in other areas. On the positive, research is a good fit with Dr. Tanabe and ADAPT.</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant: Shayne Hauglum Ph.D (c), MSNA, CRNS, ARNP                                        	Position:  NAP

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

Overall: Has significant clinical expertise and has taught students in a variety of settings. Would like to utilize this experience as a faculty researcher, clinician and educator.
Short term goals: Develop as a faculty researcher
Long term goals:  Produce research in the areas of TTE ultrasound (U/S), pain predictive models for improved practice changes (e.g. pain management - 70% of patients still have post-op pain).  

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)N/A

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?
  
Duke is cutting edge &amp; has the creative innovative technological (e.g. google glasses etc.) and mentorship resources. These resources will allow me “to push unique best practices forward in healthcare (anesthesia). For example, the stethoscope (swan-ganz catheter; TTE) will be replaced by U/S devises where providers will be able to perform visual real-time assessments. Mr. Hauglum would like to apply his significant clinical expertise towards developing research to improve practices and to “give back to community”.

4.	What are your strengths?

Has a unique clinical/teaching experience and is exposure to all types of students (BSN, APNs, DNP, undergraduate, graduate) primarily including CRNA’s. Able to teach practical clinical concepts but dove-tails this clinical experience with his business entrepreneurship. 

•	Interventional pain (intervene preoperatively based on predictive pain model)
•	Developed improved simulation lab
•	Teaching multiple diverse students
•	Business entrepreneurship

5.	What are your weaknesses?

Academic scholarship. No other peer-reviewed publications, or poster presentations except for dissertation. While his initial goal was to obtain a PhD in physiology he realized that he wanted to first make a significant &amp; immediate clinical contribution and impact patients &amp; students. Originally, he had not been close to academic centers that would allow him to develop scholarship. However, he has reached out to other scientific disciplines. He currently is working with a Marine biologist who has applied for a grant to U/S sharks to perfect the portable visual ultrasounds technique. Understands that he will need scholarship mentorship which is why he is looking towards DUSON. 

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
He had more than one:
•	Extensive clinical expertise (and teaching)
•	Through his creative entrepreneurship he developed an interventional pain clinic and a 24hr anesthesia access program which was able to take a “hospital out of trouble”. Year 1: Increased revenue by 15%; Year 5: Doubled revenue
•	PhD
              
7.	What is your teaching passion?

a.	Class size-has taught variable class sizes as a teaching assistant (current position)
b.	Clinical groups-taught various clinical groups (via lecture and simulation lab) 
c.	Online-limited exposure in doctoral and teaching experience but University of Miami is moving to distance based model. Not averse to online teaching and excited to incorporate his media teaching methods online teaching. Imperative today to implement technological teaching methods
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy: Grew up in a rural area where he observed his father (a teacher) educate students and himself, as well. Learned very early on that traditional lecturing is not optimal. Blending traditional with creative non-traditional allows for more successful individualize learning experience.  He is passionate about engaging students with a hybrid teaching model. Students “need to see the heart move rather than read about it”. He has incorporated visual U/S and media in teaching methods to successfully teach physiology in class (and in simulation labs).

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?

1.	Postoperative pain predictive model -“Prediction of Severe Postoperative Pain: Modification and Validation of a Clinical Risk Prediction Tool”.  Confirmed anticipated completion May 2015 (retrospective study of 3000 patients-in data analysis phase). Developing a model to identify preoperative patients at high risk for pain early on in order to develop an individualized interventional treatment plan to reduce pain postoperatively.
2.	Develop a prospective study using predictive model (include other factors- psychological predictors)
3.	Develop education research using simulation-visual U/S and cadavers 
        Research Interests noted on CV: 
•	Acute and Chronic Pain, preoperative predictors and management strategies
•	Ultrasound technology in education and clinical practice
•	Alternative Models of Anesthesia Delivery in Today’s Healthcare Environment
•	Anesthesia simulation in improving the education of nurse anesthetists along with improving patient care, safety, and quality.
•	Critical thinking development through simulation

9.	For recent (DNP) graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?

This PhD candidate is on “target for graduating in May 2015” and will publish, shortly thereafter.

10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  

•	Appreciates that Miami has a diverse (international, Spanish) students and patient population.   
•	Established a 24hr anesthesia service to increase access in rural underserved NH hospital
•	Provided anesthesia service to Veteran population 

11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for non-researcher candidates)?
 
Research mentorship &amp; resources. Technological &amp; clinical support. 

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

Practice Interests: Regional anesthesia (interventional pain). Desires to create an U/S Institute and Fellowship for CRNAs for certification (e.g. TTE, Fast scans) - money generating opportunity.
Will maintain certification and understands practice requirements for certain tracks.

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
 
Mentorship experience: Student Mentorship established with extensive experience as a preceptor, clinical &amp; simulation lab instructor. Shayne has mentored University of Miami graduate students for oral board defense (and soon DNP capstone).  Mentored many professionals as a business owner.

Research role/Grant funding:  Has not established grant funding but collaborative works with aforementioned marine biologist who is obtaining grant funding and as a research assistant with  colleague‘s related research: Nurse Anesthetists Education -“Attitudes and Perceptions of Newly Graduated Certified Nurse Anesthetists about Their Nurse Anesthesia Program’s Ability to sufficiently Educate Graduates to Practice Anesthesia Independently as Full Service Providers”.    

Publications: stated previously

14.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.
Available Thursday’s and Friday’s if asked for an on campus interview. 

After asked:
Candidate available after graduation in May 2015. No major relocation requirements (e.g. no house to sell).  Wife has a DNP and would be interested in opportunities in the Durham Chapel Hill area. She is supportive of Shayne’s goal to obtain an academic faculty position and her ability to relocate is not a barrier. 

15.	Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.? Yes

16.	Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.) No

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: 

The interview Shayne Haughlum reiterated the prior review of his submitted documents. (See worksheet)

Bottom line:  
•	Strong clinical NA expert with 10 yrs. experience as business entrepreneur (e.g. Founder of White Mountain Anesthesia – “Responsible for all aspects of running &amp; managing an anesthesia department…” 
•	Has initiated multiple innovative teaching experiences (visual U/S simulation).  
•	No peer reviewed publications, scholarship for this PhD candidate who will defend in May 2015. Per the NA faculty position posting:  “A record of scholarship” distinguishes a well-qualified candidate for this position.The other non-Duke NA candidate has more academic scholarship.

Engaging interview and would bring this strong clinical candidate for campus interview unless we require established publication and evidence of grant funding.</Comment>

Areas of Evaluation

**Typos in her CV, and obvious lack of ability to pull together an academic CV. Cover letter rambles. I’ve never seen anyone submit two CVs.

1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

•	Publications are not in peer-reviewed journals, one listed publication is a conference proceeding. 
•	She does not report any research funding, and under research, lists working on a R01 as a Research Assistant.
•	She lists an unfunded HRSA grant – no date listed.
•	Lists “Secured multiple grants and funding individually and as part of a community agency or task force”. No listing of type, amount, or purpose of any of these grants.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

•	No program of research or scholarship is evident in her CV. 
•	She does not report any research funding, and no scholarship evident since 2012.  
•	For her ND degree, she reports “Data was compiled and analysis completed plus several drafts of the results written for publication in 2003”; however, none of these drafts are reported to have been published. 


3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

•	She was previously a social worker, second degree RN. She has taught Psych-Mental health nursing.
•	Her Master’s degree is as a CNS in Psych-Mental Health, but no certification is evident; nor has she practiced in this area since 2003.
•	She is certified as a Nurse Educator, but not as a CNS.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

•	Has done independent studies with students in the past. No other formal mentoring on CV.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

•	Last practiced in 2003, but experience was as psych-mental health consultant, hospice and palliative care. 

6.	Service to the profession

•	Only local school service listed. No leadership positions on her CV at any level.

7.	Job stability

•	She tends to stay in one place for 1-3 years, longest position was 6 years in academic nursing.
•	Looks like she has been employed in academic nursing since 2003 without any gaps.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON

•	She may be a psych-mental health nurse and nurse educator, but has not demonstrated scholarship at any level for the past three years. It is my impression that she has been in teaching-intensive schools, and that may be the reason why (re-read the cover letter, this is her rationale for lack of scholarship).

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:



Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would not recommend a phone screen.</Comment>

No program of research or scholarship evident from CV. CV states that several drafts of her doctoral work completed, but not published.

Very little clinical practice. Ten months as a hospice nurse in 2003. A clinical rotation in MSN program in palliative care in 2002 for one semester. Psych Consult Liason Nurse for 2 years 2001-2003. No clinical experience since 2003.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):  How much course coordinator role he has had (ie primary teaching of a course, or more as guest lecturer). What education courses/instructional design courses has he had? Does he intend to continue practice if faculty position here?

<Comment>Applicant Reviewer Worksheet  (completed by R.Richesson)                                                   

Applicant :   Linda Stone               			 Position:  Nurse Anesthesia


Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.

None.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Some of the content on her CV is underspecified and not formatted as would be expected in an academic CV. She lists 7 “professional presentations” related to chemical dependency and wellness activities for nurse anesthesists, but there are no dates (just the years). One presentation entry was attributed to the “Duke University DNP program” from “2009-2011”.  This leads me to believe few if any of these presentations were peer reviewed or for formal conferences. 

No other scholarship evidenced.




3.	Teaching experience 

No formal teaching experience is evident on her CV, although she does list dozens of lectures that she has given to students. 

Her cover letter mentions that she has ten years experience as a nurse anesthesia educator.  

Her current position is as Associate Director of Didactic and Clinical Education at the Raleigh School of Nurse Anesthesia in Raleigh, NC (since 2005).  

4.	Mentorship experience   - None evident 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice  - Extensive clinical experience 

6.	Service to the profession

She chaired the North Carolina Association of Nurse Anesthetists Education and Research Committee for five years
very active in the national and state nurse anesthesia professional associations, and has held several leadership positions.

7.	Job stability  - Has been in the Raleigh area for nearly 20 years in 3 different positions, each for a substantial amount of time.  She has been in her current position (Associate Director of Didactic and Clinical Education / Assistant Adjunct Professor; Raleigh School of Nurse Anesthesia) for 10 years.  

(Note: CV lists this current role as affiliated with UNC-Greensboro – not sure if there is a relationship there or it is a typo / copy-paste mistake.)

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

She has clinical expertise in Nurse Anesthesia, seems embedded and engaged with state Nurse Anesthesia organizations, and seems to have many years’ worth of experience coordinating clinical preceptors in this area. 

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)    -- None evident.  (She did receive a NCANA Humanitarian Award in 2010, but not sure what for.)

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):

Elaborate on teaching experience. Given her current job title, would expect to see more formal teaching accomplishments and responsibilities highlighted on CV. 



Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  



Cease recruitment. While she likely has more teaching experience than is evident on her CV, she does not have any demonstrated scholarship that is a fundamental requirement for this position.</Comment>

10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale: On campus interviews, exceptionally strong candidate. We will need to address clinical practice questions. I also recommend scheduling interview time with Terry Valiga or Marilyn Oermann due to his strong interest to gain pedagogical skills in didactic development. Others: Barb Turner, Sharon Hawks, Chuck Vacchiano, Frank Tich.</Comment>

Reference Name/ Title/ Organization:  Nancy Woods/Professor/University of Washington
Quote from Dr. Woods: “Most promising young people I have seen in the field in a long time.

Established a faculty practice while at UNC, the clinic is a community based clinic in Durham had a need for a psych mental health NP. Cheryl developed the core of the mental health program for the clinic. She continued to practice there. Had many talks about the value of her continuing to practice.

She really understands what the community needs. 

C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement).

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
a.	Two poster presentations - ? DNP work: Lit review and results from Nurse Faculty Shortage
b.	one documented presentation Health Services Cost Review Commission, Presentation of the Program Evaluation of the Nurse Support Program II

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

a.	Difficult to discern from CV: 

3.	Teaching experience 
a.	Unable to evaluate – appears none	

4.	Mentorship experience: None listed on CV – her current position is as an administrator (unknown if Administrator III indicates a senior-level position). 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

a.	ANCC Psych-Mental Health Certificate (RN-BC)

6.	Service to the profession: behavioral health in rural NC – the ED in which she works serves a very diverse population.

7.	Job stability: nearly 5 years as an Administrator for the Nurse support program, 12years doing behavioral health triage. Also currently in DNP program, unclear which position is her primary position and if either is a per-diem position.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON: is ANCC certified in psych/mental health, has psych/mental health nursing experience in an ED that serves a very diverse population in eastern NC.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):
Please describe current clinical practice and how this prepares you for this position.
Can you give some examples of how you’ve been a mentor? (interested if her examples are clinical, or in the administrative position)
Please describe more about what you do as an administrator for the Nurse Support Program II 
Ask about her DNP program of study – what is her timeline (CV says 2015…where is she in the process)? Describe your capstone project – I’m interested in finding out if her capstone project (potential area for scholarship) is clinical and/or utilizes her psych/mental health experience, or if it’s focused on leadership or some aspect of her work with the Nurse Support Program

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Phone screen: it is difficult to evaluate this candidate from this CV. Unable to determine percentage of effort currently focused on clinical practice, and there is no mention of teaching experience and limited scholarship.  Her other position suggests a need for a diverse skill-set (organization, leadership, supervision).  I recommend a phone screen to explore this candidate’s own sense of how her clinical experience has prepared her for this position. I also would like to give her the opportunity to expand upon her CV.</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     

Applicant:    Geoffry Williams, MD, PhD                                    Position:  Sr. Nurse Researcher
Interviewed by Rachel Richesson, May 21, 2015

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

Short term: he wants to continue to pursue his research in a new environment with new opportunities.   Longer term: wants to change clinical practice, care teams, and make impact. His specific research / clinical goal is to develop:  “More intensive interventions with TEAMS and technology to reach more people. “


He framed this in terms of his life goals. History….  Has worked at U. Rochester for 30 years (redisency  PHD fellowships). Has gotten grants. Earlier research built qx first, and then build models around health behavior change from those models.  All around mental and physical health outcomes.  (Incidentally, he had the unique opp to train with George Engle (devl of biopsychosocial model).  Has also written/tested 5-6 interventions trying to build health outcomes.

Now…. Trying to decide what to do with rest of career. Wants to work with at a high-level to expand models for health behavior change and MAINTENANCE.  The latter part is a big gap in the literature.  Sees many opportunities =- plus all the changes in health care going on make this drive a need for change.  It has been demonstrated that teams work well or better (i.e., Give more change / impact) than single clinician and he wants to build evidence and tools to support those teams.

He is Curious to design and test “virtual environment” around planning and goal adoption at home.  Then he REALLY wants to extend these tools to healthcare teams.  
He has developed and validated a qx on patient automony.  Believes this concept is critical to achieving patient centered outcomes.  He thinks we need to be looking in patient charts and EMRs and looking at documented measure and evidence of autonomy….  He asked me if Duke values importance of patient reported data…  and is the idea of collecting surveys from patients and integrating into Epic EHR on our horizon.  (An interesting question that indicates to be his readiness to incorporate his work into practice tools. )
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)

He “grew’ up there …..  so, gets less attention (especially in terms of access to EHR or changes in process. 

His children are growing up and he is open to a new place.  This is an opp for him to think “at this stage of my career are there new opportunities and where is the best place to achieve my goals. 

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Open to all options and this point.  Has visited the area and likes it. 

4.	What are your strengths?
Has trained lots of nurses and nurse practitioners, in addition to physicians, Pas, and other providers. Mostly tobacco, but now lipids and control.
He has taught medical interviewing  for many, many years (and points out that it could just as easily be nursing..) It is all about the quality of communication and patient needs.
Communication skills and training experience. As part of his teaching he watches video tapes and helps learners understand the quality and effectiveness of the communications. 
He strongly believes that clinicians “get” something out of communications as well …    and he finds it rewarding and important to explore how both patients and providers benefit from good communication. 
In his current care environment he works with 5 RDs. And gives feedback on their interviewing for diet qx data. 

5.	What are your weaknesses?
(Sorry – I forgot to ask!)
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?
Worked with the American Academy of Health Care Communication, and I was honored to receive the George Engel award from that group several years ago. The Engel Award is presented annually for outstanding research contributing to the theory, practice and teaching of effective healthcare communication and related skills.
7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy – 

Philosophy is embedded in Self Determin Theor.  He believes learners need to be introduced to the material, given enough structure to get them started, but then people need to have their own motivation to carry them through. He is “hands on”.

Typically, he gives a lecture, assigns reading, demonstrate the interview; then he watches, and lets students tell him when they are ready to try …. 
His dissertation was on how learning climates affect medical education …. (Interviewer note: very relevant to education and his research area.)

______________________________________________

Has not taught a semester long class.  He mostly teaches clinically. But, with that said he gives lots and lots of lectures.

He gives series of lectures each year to med students on behavior changes (~10 topics) and mindfulness teaching.  
For School of Pub health– 2-3 lectures per year. Will train any fellows (from cancer, endocrinology, …)  that ask each year.  People can come to him to get specific training as well.   (e.g., a psychologist from Portugal cam for a few weeks to learn teaching methods. Person from HIV clinic came over 3 months to learn specific behavior change motivation skills.) 

Preventative medicine residents – he gives feedback in terms of interviewing style.   
Every year he teaches medical interviewing  course – with standardized patients.  ~10 days a year.

Does most work of his teaching in graduate seminars (10 + years) – people read and bring projects and he presents feedback and suggestion. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Needs to de-stress primary care. .. and promote patients to adopt healthy behavior. Focused on building interventions to do this.
Sees lots of messaging and internet resources that are NOT helpful to patients. Example, FDA puts scary messages on meds. But does not give information on natural consequences of untreated disease.   So patients uninformed about drug choice.  Also they are under-informed about the impact of lifestyle on disease.  Behavior change can have a bigger impact then meds but not well described or promoted.
Med adherence, exercise, smoking .. diet….  Those are hard … 
WANTS to bring these messages, and care teams together. ..  Choose CV area because they are common , and we have lots of meds and behaviors to change….
It is limitation of contact time that clinicians have with patients.  How make most of that.  Has created 5 virtual clinicians.  They can substitutes for real clinicians (not as well, of course) and take some of the time burden off them. Wants to evaluate them and put into real use.

We need good data.  His access to EMR has been difficult at UR …  He wonders if that would be different at another institution..
(Interviewer Note: his language through the interview made it clear that he is very cognizant of care team members (nurse, doc, PA, pharmacists ) and roles, and seems to value them all.)

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
n/a
10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)   

Great question and fully supportive of diversity. For example in his virtual tools, he has long thought that it could be adapted to appeal to different audiences . And can test if it is best to match people on race, age, culture.

Fundamental issues of race, justice and autonomy are important in any discussion of diversity.

Autonomy is a human need that touches all races and cultures.  Autonomy might be enhanced or not for some populations or cultures.  This can undermine motivations …. If do not attend to important needs.  Has looked at smoking intervention effectiveness in black vs white communities.  Would like to conduct future research to see if sense of autonomy is related to different responses to behavior interventions.

Loves working with people of different cultures. Has worked with people from all different cultures and sees differences worth exploring further.

11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?
Would love to have a (Motivation/psychs)  lab where he can test this out. All CV guidelines have changed from risk levelts. But no one knows how patietns react to that.  
Would need a team to work with him, or psychometrics/stats .  Does not need his own FTE for these  but access to this kind of expertise.

Need access to EMR.  Access to make changes and ….
Health Services researchers and health economist to help measure cost effectivess of interventions he wants to propose.  

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

He does not know all opportunities .. so that is his job to understand them. But when pressed for an early guess of his priorities:
Would spend 30% time clinically and the rest research or teaching. The cutting edge is how to bring interventions into clinical world and he wants to do whatever combination of research and teaching that can facilitate that.
Focus: Smoking cessation, lipids, hypertension, physical activity. 

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Clarify experience with Nursing students and faculty/researchers:

For all 3 nursing PHD students that he mentioned in his letter, he was an official listed member, but never the chair. The chair had to be in primary dept as student… So, he did not qualify. He was on each committee because they wanted Self Determination theory expertise.
His appt is in the Med School, although he has had adjunct appt to the SON over the years.  (Can’t remember what years or if current.)

Darryl Minicuchi (Sharp), RN, PhD,  has been a collaborator of his since 1989.  And she is on a number of papers with him.  She could be a reference if we want to call her. He was on her committee.  Her dissertation was on Self Determination Theory.  Now they are colleagues.
He served as an informal medical consultant for the medical screen program  (working with the Assoc Daean at School of Nursing at the time.)

He thinks that NP more open to motivation theory than most docs. He has worked with advanced practice (PA and NP) providers in his practice for years.  He is the Collaborating physician for Darryl (NP) .  She is a psych nurse NP. He is not certified in Psychiatry but has had psych training.

He is about to start (survivorship program) in Cancer Program, he will be working to train the new NP that they hire regarding lipids, smoking, etc. They are promoting a lifestyle program for patients who smoke.
He has trained NP in the HIV community to develop strategies to deal with smoking cessation in HIV-infected communities. (High prevalence of smoking.  Big issue because it lowers immune system, but they get a different form of atheroschlerosis.  ..)

Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:

Discuss in search committee.  If there is issue of “fit” or need/preference for a nursing degree then that needs to be determined before inviting him. 
I suggest continued recruitment and campus visit. This candidate is clearly an established and competent researcher with demonstrated success in external funding. He is still actively writing a number of grants and has high likelihood of success.  His expertise and training align with important educational and research needs of DUSON. 
After the phone interview, I found this applicant to be pleasant and unassuming and very focused and passionate about his research interests. I felt that he had an understanding and genuine respect for nursing research and advanced and independent practice. I think he would work well with faculty at DUSON and in Duke, and would add a valuable component to teaching and research activities here.  Based on his comments, I see immediate opportunities for collaboration with DUSON faculty in: informatics, oncology, CV, medication adherence (Bradi Granger), diabetes, and HIV. He has 30 years of medical experience working with providers of all types and patients. His experience teaching medical interviewing and PhD in psychology could benefit a number of nursing courses here.</Comment>

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :     Brett Howard	             			 Position:  Psych NP


***CV does not include teaching experience and scholarship program. If this is really the case and not an oversight,  I think that he may only qualify for an Instructor level, which I am not sure we are offering at this point.
Can Crystal ask questions about teaching experience and scholarship? If answer is I do not have them, then I recommend not calling.   If otherwise, append these information to his CV and I recommend a phone screen.

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity. (see below)

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
His CV did not contain any information about program of scholarship. Candidate obtained PhD in in Psychology from Alliant University in 2003 and it is odd that he did not even list his dissertation as an evidence of scholarly work.  I am hoping that this  is only an oversight on his part (although a major oversight, I must say!).  His program of scholarship and pubs are questions that need to be verified.

3.	Teaching experience 
No teaching experience at the undergrad and grad level.

4.	Mentorship experience 
No mentorship experience

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
This area is his biggest strength. Started as a research psychologist then behavioral consultant then was an Intelligence Officer for the US Intelligence Service 2005-07 and was even deployed to Baghdad. Back to the States, realized he can do more to advocate for mental health care, went back to school to be a nurse. Became a nurse in 2010 then Pysch NP in 2013. Been in clinical practice as psych NP since 2013 .

6.	Service to the profession (see above, I do not see any membership to professional organizations mentioned in CV).

7.	Job stability – been in his position since 2013

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Clearly, he brings expertise in mental health.  He is also knowledgeable about veterans’ needs and he will be able to contribute immediately to the Psych NP training grant that Duke and Durham VAMC has.  I am hoping that his CV is incomplete and he just did not include teaching experience and scholarship program. This needs to be verified with the applicant.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
His exposure to the military has afforded him opportunities to the many mental health needs of the veterans. In his letter, he stated that he will provide training on depression to NP members of the AANP DC Chapter. In November, he will also be talking to a group of physicians who are members of the American College of Physicians DC Chapter.

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):
**needs to obtain information about his program of scholarship (pubs, grants) and teaching experience. The info derived should be appended to his CV

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  
Recommend that Crystal calls to verify if indeed he has teaching experience, pubs, and scholarly work. This is a clinically strong candidate with an interesting career background (behavioral health counselor then,  PhD, then Intelligence Officer in the Army, then Nursing, then Psych NP). If he indeed lacks teaching experience, pubs, and program of scholarship, he can be considered for an Instructor track  but I do not think that we are offering that. And for this reason, no phone screen.

If with pubs/research and teaching experience, then go ahead with phone screen.</Comment>

<Comment>1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

Had a K30 (junior scientist is position described in CV) at Univ of Alabama Birmingham after completing his PhD from UNC. Has participated in grant writing for larger grants (VA), but most of his funding has been small grants. Has 10 publications (4 as first author), and 2 book chapters (one as first author). 28 presentations listed. To be 8 years out of his PhD and experience in research intensive schools, his funding and publication record as PI/ first author is minimal to be an associate professor in Miami. In addition, his publications do not appear to be data-based, but more clinically/ education focused – does not appear that he published anything from his dissertation, unless the first two with Kjervk are papers 1 &amp; 2.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

Research interests appear focused on juvenile and minority populations mental health needs.

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

Has experience as clinical faculty, course coordinator, and program director in area of pscyh-mental health. 

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

Has mentored DNP, PhD, and graduate students on various committees and serving as chair on one PhD committee presently.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Has experience as a Psych-Mental Health NP and is currently practicing clinically.

6.	Service to the profession

Has professional and community service congruent with the position applied for (PMH focus)

7.	Job stability
Is currently an Associate professor at University of Miami

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

He appears to be a very qualified academic/ clinical PMH candidate who’s work has also focused on diverse populations.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would recommend phone screen.  From his cover letter, he is seeking full professor. Based on his CV and my understanding of the APT process at DUSON, he would only meet criteria to come in as an Associate Professor without tenure.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :  Thomas Hill             			 Position:  Sr. Nurse Researcher    (reviewed by Richesson, 29-june-2015)

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.

No research funding. No NIH grants in review.  3 fellowships are mentioned but it is not clear whether there was external funding or by what mechanism. UC-Davis sponsored 2 of the 3 mentioned fellowships - a pre-doctoral and graduate fellowships. It is not clear if the NIEHS funded his fellowship below:
2006-2008 National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences Fellowship, University of California – Davis 

Candidate lists (2) other grants submitted and not awarded. Both were from the University. Appears to have no experience submitting NIH grants. 

2 first-author pulciations: one in Journal of Molecular Biomarkers &amp; Diagnosis (2014) and one in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications (2010).  Nine other co-authors publications ranging from 1989 – 2014 – all on topics of molecular biology or veterinary.

5 first-author/presenter Juried presentations listed – all for toxicology or cancer conferences.


2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
None.   PhD is in toxicology. The candidate has a few publications in toxicology and cancer. No focused program of research evident and no articulation of research objectives. The cover letter indicates that Dr. Hill is undertook the PhD in toxicology to be a translational researchers – exploring molecular mechanisms of cancer, but there is no evidence of clinical translation (or even intent for clinical translation in his publications, talks, grant applications, or cover letter).

3.	Teaching experience 
In past 2 years at U. Northern Co., he taught:
NURS 612 Advanced Pharmacology (major revisions 2014/2015)
NURS 614 Advanced Pathophysiology (revisions in progress)
NURS 658 Applied Nursing Genomics
NURS 326 Pathophysiology (minor updates)
NURS 380 Research and Evidence-based Practice (new course, online launch)
Was a teaching assistant for a number of courses in toxicology and biology from 2007-2011.
Has led several writing workshops.

4.	Mentorship experience  -- None

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
CV reports he was a Clinical Nurse II for 2 years in a burn unit (1992-94) and then as a Clinical Nurse II Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit – both at UC Davis.

Cover letter says his “clinical experience spans the Medical, Pediatric and Burn ICUs, the Pain and Chemotherapy Infusion Clinics, as well as the practical aspects of toxicosis and its health-related impacts.”

There is no evidence of engagement in nursing organizations as listed presentations nor do any of his publications address nursing.

He does list these memberships:
STTI (Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing)  1992 – Current
ABA (American Burn Association)  1991 -- 1995
AACN (American Association of Critical Care Nurses)  1994 – Current
Board Member, Sacramento Chapter 1996-2000
SOT (Society of Toxicology)  2007 -- Current
NLN (National League of Nursing)  2013 – Current

6.	Service to the profession -- None

7.	Job stability
Not clear. Has been at Univ of Colorado since 2011 - as a post-doc, and now assistant professor (since 2013).  There is a very odd and suspicious gap in his doctoral work (“*Progress to doctoral degree terminated in spring 2003 due to abrupt loss of research funds in sponsoring department.) for 2 years.  Then he does a second MSN in Nursing Educations.  A strange progression of majors and jobs over the years and no clear focus.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON  - None

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
None evident.  Cover letter states: “Finally, the focus on diversity and the individual student at Duke University resonates with my values as an educator and an under-represented minority in nursing; I believe you would find me to be a strong asset to the School.”

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): None.

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Cease recruitment. I see no evidence of successful program of research or external funding. No central themes to his publications and presentation and no articulation of his research objectives.  No presentation or publication in any venue that has any connection to nursing, public health, or translational research. I do not see where he would contribute specifically to DUSON, and certainly I see no potential for independent external funding.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :  Thomas Hill             			 Position:  Senior  Nurse Researcher  (SrNR)

Areas of Evaluation

1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
SrNR Position announcement clearly states: “Eligible candidates will have a well-established program of funded research and will be eligible for appointment at the Associate Professor or Professor rank with tenure”.

There is no clear record of established, current or potential NIH research funding in the post-doctoral setting base on the material presented. Based on these data alone that indicates lack of sustainability I recommend to cease recruitment.

Research Funding:
Candidate lists 2 graduate basic science fellowships (in pharmacology for drug development and pulmonary immunology) and one pre-doctoral fellowship (in toxicology) without clear funding source.
UC-Davis probably sponsored the pre-doctoral and graduate fellowships. It is possible that the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences funded some of his fellowships (via research training program). Received a student award.

No current grants in review.  No primary NIH grants submitted. Lists 2-unawarded University of Colorado (research or research to practice) grants. One grant was submitted to The Mountain and Plains Research Center which is funded by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Publications:
Only 11 peer reviewed publications (1 in review) which consist of 2 first authored publications focused on molecular level research. Publications primarily focus on bench molecular/biological research and no evidence translation into clinical practice through publications or presentations although cover letter indicates that candidate obtained PhD in toxicology as a foundation to become a translational researcher. First authored peer reviewed presentations are in basic toxicology or cancer research conferences.
          

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
PhD is in Pharmacology and toxicology from University of California-Davis. 
Research areas of interest are:
•	Effects of environmental toxicants encountered in home and workplace on normal immune function and symptom management in presence and absence of pulmonary comorbidities. 
•	Specific focus on toxicology of small molecule aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenicals and metalloids in drinking water to the epithelium of the pulmonary tree and the dermis. 
•	Effects on signal transduction, biochemical functions of the innate immune response and wound healing. Investigations in population based, in vitro and ex vivo systems.

As Assistant Professor of Nursing with the University of Northern Colorado, he began developing a proposal for a translational research program investigating environmental impacts on the innate immune defense of the lung due to the ingestion of heavy-metal/metalloid contaminated drinking water. While he maintains that his research interests include translational clinical components. His initial email clearly states: “While I enjoyed my former academic position, my ultimate goal is a research and teaching position with an active bench laboratory component.”

Limited scholarship as required for this position as noted above. Limited publications and presentation focused on bench research and not translation to clinical practice. Many academic awards listed.

3.	Teaching experience 
Assistant Professor at University Northern Colorado since 2013.
Courses Taught:
NURS 612 Advanced Pharmacology (major revisions 2014/2015)
NURS 614 Advanced Pathophysiology (revisions in progress)
NURS 658 Applied Nursing Genomics
NURS 326 Pathophysiology (minor updates)
NURS 380 Research and Evidence-based Practice (new course, online launch)
Taught toxicology and biology courses as teaching assistant (2007-2011).
Selected Courses Developed:
NURS 380 Research and Evidence-based Practice revised, adapted and launched as new on-line 8 week course with innovative virtual student presentation exercise. (2014)
NURS 711 Advanced Theory and Knowledge Development in Nursing (2013)

4.	Mentorship experience 
No mentorship for doctoral or research projects.  He has precepted nursing students in clinical practice. Inherent mentorship as an assistant professor faculty member.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Cover Letter: “Clinical experience spans the Medical, Pediatric and Burn ICUs, the Pain and Chemotherapy Infusion Clinics, as well as the practical aspects of toxicosis and its health-related impacts.”

CV: Clinical Nurse II for 13 years: Two years in a University of California-Davis burn unit and then (11 years) in a Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Clinical specialization includes Pulmonary and Burn Critical Care, as well as complex wound care for surgical reconstruction. He has CCRN (Critical Care RN) Certification.

6.	Service to the profession 
Limited. There is limited data in publications and presentations to suggest professional service.

There is no evidence of current “active” nursing organizations membership 
Current membership include: Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing since 1992 (Faculty counselor in 2014), American Association of Critical Care Nurses since National League of Nursing since 2013.
He lists the current membership to Society of Toxicology

Some prior (2014) academic university services include: Faculty affairs committee, graduate Curriculum committee, Nursing-Faculty Student organization, School of Nursing Faculty representative.

Past memberships include: American Burn Association 1991 – 1995 Board Member, Sacramento Chapter 1996-2000. Candidate list 2014 – 2015 Northern Colorado Medical Center Foundation Scholarship Committee, Committee member

7.	Job stability
Stability exists with 4 years at the University of Northern Colorado but limited upward research mobility since PhD completed in 2011. Mr. Hill has been an Assistant Professor for ~ 2 years.

He worked At the University of California- Davis for 13 year as a nurse and 1 year as a nurse intern.

Interesting MSN to doctoral education trajectory which was interrupted due to lack of funding. He changed from a doctorate in Nursing to a PhD in Pharmacology and Toxicology after completed his MSN.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
Limited in the SrNR position as stated.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities).  Candidate is an “under-represented minority&quot;.  He has “specific cross cultural preparation (? Source document) and reads both German and Spanish.” 

Mr. Hill is developing a proposal for a translational research program investigating environmental impacts on the innate immune defense of the lung due to the ingestion of heavy-metal/metalloid contaminated drinking water. Data suggests that such exposures not only affects Third world but Continental US”. As such he proposes that his research “addresses community health issues and nursing concerns relevant to rural and underserved populations that may affect both incidence and persistence of upper respiratory infections in healthy or compromised individuals.

Cover letter states: “Finally, the focus on diversity and the individual student at Duke University resonates with my values as an educator and an under-represented minority in nursing; I believe you would find me to be a strong asset to the School.” 

10.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): 
Not applicable

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Cease recruitment primarily due to a lack of well-established program of funded or potentially funded research in the post-doctoral setting which indicates lack of sustainability at this point in his career. Mr. Hill’s limited publications and presentations are focused on bench research. While he has established experience as a nurse and in teaching and in developing curriculum (including  pharmacology, pathophysiology) at a school of nursing there is limited evidence that his research has been translated to clinical, nursing or community health at this time. I think that his contributions to DUSON in the applied position are limited at this point in his career.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant:   Tony Roberson  205-470-7253     Position:  Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner	
PHONE INTERVIEW
Additional Questions:
1) reviewed CV and cover letter – please could you further discuss your role
 Please further discuss the UA-Tuscaloosa /VA collaboration and his role in the development of the PMH-NP program (role as director of practice partnerships)

Psych NP interested in collaborations with community partners, met DON at Tuscaloosa VA – shared interest in rural veterans and recognized that there was a lack of resources (medical and psych) How could they develop a program to develop FNPs with psych specialty as these would be the providers who could meet this need.  Established educational program, recruited from within VA (nurses who were established in the VA system – hoped those nurses would go back to their comfortable settings). Consulted with VA providers to tailor the curriculum that would fit VA needs  

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? – Long term goal: promotion, but also grow as a psych NP, scholar and educator. Bring together research &amp; practice interests consistent with academic 
Would like to get back into more clinical work than consulting or balance these more.
Patient population: experience with VA system and juvenile justice system/prison system
2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Has been strategic and deliberate in his academic moves – he’s ‘not unhappy’ in current job, but this current position isn’t the fit (clinically and personally) for him (more Miami than the university). Seeking a different position for clinical and personal reasons as well as he feels he’s ready for the opportunities Duke has to offer at this point in his career. 
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  (“seeking appointment at a professor level, non-tenure earning/clinical track” currently an associate professor) – refer to position announcement
Enjoyed living in triangle when lived here previously (while in PhD program @ UNC) knew he needed to seek other experiences, not ready to be fully in academia yet, wanted other experiences but has always wanted to ‘come back’.  The comment about seeking full professor in his letter was to indicate career goals - not a &apos;deal breaker&apos;. Interested in a position at Duke - understands that each university has own APT committee &amp; academic advancement pathways.
4.	What are your strengths?
A.	Effective educator across all levels of nursing (prelicensure – PhD)
b.	Clinical background broad – can apply to various settings and offer students a diversity of experiences clinically. 
5.	What are your weaknesses?

Comfortable with teaching large class sizes. Has been clinical instructor for pre-licensure students as well as clinical preceptor for APRN. Feels like he’s flexible and can make clinical experiences work for any level learner.  Feels as though his clinical practice has been with a diverse population enjoys infusing cultural sensitivity throughout classroom and clinical activities.
A.	Class size: Comfortable with big classes (70 pre-licensure) as well as clinical groups of 6-8 or 1:1.
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online: uses ‘flipped classroom’ approach with on-campus activities – allows him to be facile with distance education as well.

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?  (are licenses current? Appear to be expired on CV. Please describe current clinical practice and what kind of practice you anticipate pursuing locally in NC)
Yes licenses are current – was embarrassed about that, offered to update and send new CV with those changes. 
Most recent clinical practice is mostly consulting with juvenile justice system (Miami Dade county) and community violence action group. Working with youth who are engaged in domestic violence against parent, runs group therapies.  More consulting work – but interested to get back into ‘frontline/clinical’ work

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet        (completed by R.Richesson, 7-23-2015)                                             

Applicant: Eun-Ok Im, PhD, MPH, RN, CNS, FAAN    Position:  Sr. Nurse Researcher


1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short term – waiting for 2 R01’s to be funded (she is optimistic and hopeful), and wants to continue to work that research.  If her one R01 submission (score=12%ile) is not funded by NIA, then it is in the funding range for NINR, and so she would hope that NINR would fund. She has had several conversations about this with NIH project officers and her research advisors at UPenn about how to transfer the application if not funded. Now she is waiting on NIH council for NIA funding decision.   
Long-term goal – moving research toward long term interventions and evaluation research question.  
She wants to continue teaching and mentoring students.

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Daughter just graduated UPenn and she is now free to move and pursue other options.  She recalls a fondness for the Triangle area after she has spent some time here at UNC. Her daughter is looking for jobs in the Triangle area and Dr. Im welcomes the prospect of living closer to her.

3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
Duke in particular has high potential to support her research and has a reputation of teaching excellence that she can feed into.  Also, her ; interests in international health and women’s health would be supported here.

4.	What are your strengths?
•	Feminist approach in teaching and research.  She tries to listen to students and incorporate their opinions in her discussions.
•	Significant expertise in nursing theory 
•	International research projects (Hong Kong, China, Korea, Tawain, Singapore, …)
•	Also, she note that she is a nice person (   ) and that has contributed to her research accomplishments.
5.	What are your weaknesses?

She is not a native speaker of English, and she knows the limitations of her accent.  She uses a number of multi-media tools to minimize the impact of this for students.  

(Note from interviewer:  I found Dr. Im to be articulate and fairly easy to understand. There were occasional on the call that I had trouble understanding her, but I think is was more an issue of our cell phone connections than her accent. Certainly, she was very thoughtful or forthcoming in all her responses and understandable from my perspectives.) 

She also added as far as another weakness… Perhaps her work with triangulation of methods have perhaps made her research skills in a tad weaker in quantitative or qualitative than if she had focused her research exclusively on one method.  

6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?

Her research program and her R01’s that have been funded:
2007-2013 PI, NIH/NINR, R01, “Ethnic-specific Midlife Women’s Attitudes toward Physical Activity.”
$1.84 million (R01 NR010568).

2005-2011 PI, NIH/NINR/NIA, R01, “A Multiethnic Internet Study on Menopausal Symptoms,” $1.2
million (R01 NR008926).

2003-2009 PI, NIH/NINR/NCI, R01, “Cancer Pain Management-Decision Support Computer
Program,” $ 1.8 million (R01 NR007900).

7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size – Ideal class size is 10-15, but she has taught classes up to 25 students.

b.	Clinical groups  -  N/A

c.	Online – has used hybrid methods, such as online discussion that is later followed up with live class discussion. Has never done exclusively online teaching.

d.	Discuss teaching philosophy
Uses feminist perspective; she has had a history of good teaching evaluations from students; her classes tends to be relaxed and she does not set up situations for students to challenge each other,  but does try to stimulate their learning and processing of complex ideas. She also uses a lot of multi – media tools in her classes.

Desired courses she could teach at DUSON:
Research methods, Nursing theory (has taught for 20 years); international and global health; community health; women’s health issues
8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
If NIA does not want the Ro1 could be transferred to NINR, and it is in their funding range.
Not sure if it will be funded at this point so she cannot begin the transfer yet.  Also she is not sure if there is a minimum of 1 year on NIH grant before it can be transferred from UPenn to Duke. 
She is also working on 2 more applications related to depression in Korean Americans ; maybe by October she can submit them. Not sure.
I asked if she had applied for PCORI funding, and she has in the past but has not been funded. Hard to address review comments from patients on the review panels. She is a standing member of PCORI research panel .

9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?   N/A

10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  

Her research has focused by definition on different cultures and ethnicities and the impact of these factors on individuals’ healthcare behaviors, experience and outcomes.

She was awarded a minority supplement:
2005-2011 PI, NIH/NINR/NIA, R01 Minority Supplement for Maresha Clark, “A Multiethnic Internet
Study on Menopausal Symptoms,” (3 R01 NR008926-01-02S1).

…for the R01 grant listed below. Further, for that particular R01 study, she purposefully identified a student that represented each ethnic group studied in the research and worked with them to develop and deliver the proposed research data collection.  

2007-2013 PI, NIH/NINR, R01, “Ethnic-specific Midlife Women’s Attitudes toward Physical Activity.”
$1.84 million (R01 NR010568).



11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?
Time for research, infrastructure to develop center grants; opportunities to network with other researchers; perhaps pilot funding to support her development of R01.

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

Not practicing ; Has maintained certification in CA for Comm Health Nursing 


13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

She is interested in a number of populations and could conduct her studies in this geographic area if she were to relocate here.  

Aside from NIH grant apps in review, she will not bring any current funding with her, as she holds a number of smaller pilot study grants that would be wrapped up before she came here.  She was concerned that an award specialist from Duke would help her transfer R01(s) here should she get the award(s) in the next few months. She is not sure if she would need to start the research and have the award for 1 year before she came here. I told her that we would certainly assign someone to help her with this, and all could be negotiated with the Dean if the position was offered.


14.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.

Dr. Im does not appear to be in a hurry, and seemed surprised and flattered when I told her that we would respond as best we could to meet her timelines or if she had a sense of urgency (or other potential job offers).   (My instinct is that she has not applied for other faculty positions at this time.)

In response to her desired start/relocation date if she was offered the position, Dr. Im said she thought she might be required to give 1-year notice for her school to leave her current position.  She needs to check that and will do so soon.  So, at this time, she is not sure what a realistic start date might be.

Given that, I asked her preferred timeline for a campus visit if the committee decides to extend an invitation to her (i.e., sooner or later).  She asked our preference, and wondered if summer would be a hard time to schedule.  I said it probably made sense for her to come sooner rather than later for the visit and the actual start dates could be negotiated if there seems to be a good match for her here.  We agreed that September might be good month to target for a 1-2 day campus visit, given the following:
 Aug 13-24. – She will be in Korea.
Sept -- &gt; open most days but Mondays 
Oct  - &amp; Nov  Possible but tend to be busier and harder to schedule for a number of reasons.

15.	Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.?

Yes .  She is a U.S. Citizen.

16.	Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.)   No.

17.	Please rate the candidate in the areas related to diversity and inclusion listed below, adding additional comments, if needed.  

	Poor	Fair	Good	Excellent	Unable to rate

a.	Promotes diversity and inclusion among student populations.    Rating = Excellent
Comments: 

Sure – she says her research on diverse ethnic and cultural groups caries over into the classroom. She was awarded an R01 student minority supplem  for an African American student. She uses theories from her multi-ethnic research in the classroom and is confident that she address and promotes diversity and inclusion more than most faculty members at this time.
				


Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Continue with recruitment.  She is a strong candidate, has a clearly established program of research, numerous publications and strong grant history.  She is an excellent and dedicated educator, and very pleasant on the telephone.  
For a number of reasons, I do not think she has a sense of urgency about this position (maybe she wants to start in 1 year….) but I think we should schedule a campus visit to determine if this is a match and to begin discussion on timelines for the position. September seems like a good month to target but she is flexible for whatever timeline we propose. I told her to contact us at any point if her situation changes and she wants us to move more quickly.</Comment>

<Comment>Applicant :        Carrie Palmer			 Position:  AG NP (VA)


Areas of Evaluation

1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)

No funding reported. She is a DNP who has been involved with teaching and clinical practice, and has a few publications. She only has three publications since graduation with DNP 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

She has three publications, all as first author; two on diabetes, and one on hyperlipidemia. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs

She is currently an Assistant Professor at UNC, and a Duke DNP graduate. She has served as course and clinical coordinator(s) in various MSN courses at UNC. Also has undergraduate, face-to-face, and online teaching experience according to her cover letter. Her resume does not reflect course type, title, or delivery method.

4.	Mentorship experience congruent with position’s needs

She has served as DNP chair and member for several students while at UNC.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Clinical background is in primary care, but emphasizes diabetes interest in her cover letter.

6.	Service to the profession

Has served on NCNA NP Council, and various MSN committees at UNC –  she lists this service as “University Service”, but I think she means UNC SON Service. She was selected for NCNA Leadership Program for 2015.

7.	Job stability

Has been gainfully employed clinically and/or at UNC since graduation with MSN. She does not detail any work experience as a RN on her resume.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
She has experience in academic nursing as a DNP faculty member; the job she is applying for is 50% clinical practice (per my understanding) and has nurse educator (NE) requirement(s)– so she is likely a good fit for the position. Also, since she is employed by UNC SON, she has met the NC NE requirements.

9.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:


Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    I would recommend phone screen.</Comment>

	How has the experience in her current position prepared her for this position?
	What has her role been as adjunct faculty at York College besides clinical preceptor? Experience with distance education?
Plans for publication of DNP work?
What resources would she need to turn some of her public speaking effort into publications and/or what are her goals for scholarship?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Phone screen – I think a phone screen is necessary to determine this candidate’s understanding of the VA position.  Also would be an opportunity to allow her to discuss her teaching – minimal details provided in CV or cover letter.</Comment>

1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
Funding is not mentioned in the CV
Three publications. She is first author on two published articles, and a third (her dissertation work?) is listed as “accepted “ by Open Journal of Nursing. 
Seven oral presentations between 2011 and 2015.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Not evident from her CV. I’m guessing her doctoral work was focused on a nurse-led mindfulness intervention with at-risk adolescents, since she has written on the topic recently, and she presented study findings at STTI research conference in Puerto Rico this year.   

3.	Teaching experience
Visiting instructor, Towson University for 3 years.
Clinical instructor for 3 years at UM, Baltimore; assistant professor since 2014. Has taught BSN, MSN, and DNP students. CV does not list courses that she has taught. 

4.	Mentorship experience 
Not evident from her CV.

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
RN experience 1996-1999. FNP experience 2000-present. States in her cover letter that she maintains an active clinical practice in addictions; current practice setting is Elkton Treatment Center, Elkton, MD.

6.	Service to the profession
Faculty Council Secretary for the UMSON, manuscript reviewer for Journal of Psychosomatic Research and Journal of Professional Nursing. Membership in STTI, AANP, NONPF. Mentions volunteering in the community in her cover letter, but not mentioned in her CV.

7.	Job stability
She has been at UMSON since 2011. Clinically active as an FNP since 2000.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON
She states in her cover letter that she has “…a strong desire to improve the lives of veterans and the quality of health care they receive”, and she worked on a research project at the Baltimore VA with AA women with breast cancer. She has a background that blends clinical practice and teaching, so she is potentially a good match for the VA/DUSON NP program.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities) 
States in her cover letter that “providing care for unique and diverse populations” is a priority. She worked with AA women at the Baltimore VA, and she no doubt sees a diverse population of people working with addiction medicine in Baltimore.

11.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Although this applicant has experience working with students within the VA system, teaching, and clinical experience, her CV is lacking evidence of leadership and the type of commitment to scholarship expected of DUSON faculty.  Do not recommend a phone screen. -LH</Comment>

Review # 2

Areas of Evaluation
•	Research funding and publication productivity.
3 first author publications – 2015, 2014 &amp; 2011, no indication of team projects or team publications, for example, mentor shared publications
•	Focused program of research or scholarship
None reported on CV or letter of application, recent PhD (2014), little to no information on her dissertation work
•	Teaching experience 
No specifics reported in CV or letter of application, although clinical instructor 2011-2014, recently appointed Assistant Professor at University of Maryland, Baltimore (2014), no report of specific teaching or other faculty responsibilities. In letter of application she reports “developing courses and teaching in various Schools of Nursing at Baccalaureate, masters and doctoral (DNP) level.” No details given.
•	Mentorship experience 
None noted in CV or letter of application
•	Relevance and extent of clinical practice
Candidate has practiced as a certified Family NP since 2000; presently her clinical practice is in “addictions”, working as an FNP at Elkton Treatment Ctr. 
•	Service to the profession
Member of 4 professional organizations, journal reviewer for 2 journals, faculty council secretary (dates?) 
•	Job stability
Steady employment since earning BSN around 1998/1999
•	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Uncertain about match because CV and letter lacked pertinent information, the lack of attention and detail to simple academic  CV requirements concerns me, particularly since she states she has been teaching at doctoral and BSN level for some time
•	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
No evidence
•	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): 

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  No phone interview; it seems that her teaching experience is limited, although she states having course development experience. Her more recent clinical experience is limited to substance abuse treatment. I remain concerned about this individual’s background and fit.  Because we know so little about her prior teaching, could she fill a gap in the AGNP program as a FNP or would she just teach psych, since this seems to be her clinical area?   Given the limited information shared, I question whether the candidate is taking us seriously or there isn’t very much information to share.</Comment>

<Comment>Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:  Campus Visit
The position requirements include a clinically experienced NP with “commitment to teaching and practice”
Dr. Bock has been a clinically active nurse practitioner consistently since becoming certified in 1994. She has owned two practices (3yrs and 14yrs) and has Clinical, business and entrepreneurial experience.  In addition, she has maintained the educational and clinical requirements to pursue also a certification as an Emergency NP, and continues that practice.
The position also requires 2-3 years teaching at the graduate level and experience teaching and caring for diverse adult/gero populations.
While a business owner and full-time primary care provider, Dr. Bock consistently sought out opportunities to teach as adjunct faculty.  Dr. Bock has experience with course development for an advanced pathophysiology course for a remote campus of Widener University and taught physical assessment and issues in advanced practice nursing. Dr. Bock is a frequently invited lecturer to speak in various academic, community and state forums about professional advocacy, empowering NPs and increasing access to healthcare by removing restrictions on NP practice.  
In addition to being an experienced clinician, Dr. Bock role-models service to the profession. For several years, she has been a  leader on the Pennsylvania Coalition of NPs (president, vice-president, chair of reimbursement committee), served on the Health Occupations Careers Advisory Committee, and SERVPA Administrator (coordinate NP volunteers for emergency disaster response when needed by PA department of health) AANP National Certification Committee Item writer

Copy of Telephone Interview Notes in-full:

Applicant:      Lorraine Bock                           Position:  VANAP-GE Program Nurse Practitioner Faculty
1.	Please tell me what you understand to be the goals for this faculty position
Primary care track – develop skill set for primary care providers to address the needs of the veterans population
Allows for balance of clinical and academic practice for the faculty member

2.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?
Short-term: Utilize DNP “finished a year ago” have been working for the government and feels she’s made an impact on advanced practice from a political standpoint as the president of the Pennsylvania coalition of NPs and providing health services to the members and employees of the PA general assembly. However, her current practice doesn’t allow for formal opportunities to teach. She wants to integrate the program evaluation and quality improvement experience and her clinical expertise into making an impact on students/her future colleagues. Would like to focus now on an impact healthcare delivery through education of new providers. 
Develop skills and find DNP mentors
Long-term: Balance clinical and academic practice
3.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
Current position involves training emergency responders and she’s been a clinical preceptor for may years.  Her opportunities to “teach formally” are “above and beyond” her current job. , She’s been adjunct faculty for many years and would like for teaching and scholarship to be part of her professional focus and be in a position where she’d be expected to teach and be supported in those efforts.
4.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  
School of nursing is prestigious 
Loves the area interested in moving to the area
Opportunity to move to an area of the country she (&amp; family) would like to be in and opportunity with the university to combine clinical practice and academia. Be supported in her desire to teach and be a clinician and have strong DNP clinical faculty as mentors.
5.	What are your strengths?
“A starter” likes to get things up and running, then mentor folks into sustaining those projects.
“Started the program at the capitol” to get NPs to be health care providers
Likes the challenge of establishing something new
Persistent and passionate about advanced practice, increased access to health care and the NP role
6.	What are your weaknesses?
Could be considered a weakness, that once something is ‘up and running’ that she likes to hand it off to be sustained.  Likes to start things, teach colleagues to be proficient at maintaining the project, and then move on to start or evaluate something else.  start a program then hand it off…
Won’t quit – very persistent, sometimes tunnel vision if passionate about a project
7.	What is your most significant accomplishment?  (OWNED OWN PRACTICE)
Professionally: in state when NPs don’t have good regulations- she had a primary care practice that was well respected. Took care of GLBTQ and those patients felt accepted
Insurance reimbursement was too difficult for her to maintain this practice and send her adult child to college. Chose to close the practice and went to become director of legislative health services and legislative NP. 
Also feels she’s had a strong impact on the NPs of PA as an advocate for the role. Has been active and provided leadership to the PA Coalition of NPs since 2005.

8.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size -  enjoys both lecturing and having students in clinical. 
b.	Clinical groups – feels comfortable with 1:1 precepting but also enjoys coordinating the learning experience of several clinical students
c.	Online – limited experience with this as a teacher – has limited access to the technology to offer this. Her Doctoral program was ‘on-line’ so has experience as a student.  Enjoys lecturing, enjoys sharing clinical experiences and ‘precepting’ / exposing NP students to clinical opportunities and mentoring students in the clinical area
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy –“ If students understand ‘why’ – they will understand the importance of doing what their doing correctly. Teach so others understand ‘why’  then they will become expert at ‘how’”

9.	(combined with question #11) What are your research interests? Program of research plans?/ You have listed several different honors and presentations on CV – how would you summarize your area of scholarship interest. And what resources do you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing your scholarship interests?
-	Very interested in moving DNP pilot forward and expanding on it to integrating technology into areas of caregiver support – want to recognize and emphasize value of ‘stay-at-home’ caregivers.
-	Establishing a program of ‘respite care’ for care givers.  A lot of care-giving of disabled veterans falls back on their families.
-	Colleagues in AANP (Fellows) for transition. Clinical responsibilities would help her connect

10.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? (graduated may 2014) Enjoyed the work she did with caregiver support-group. (DNP project) Presented it at DNP conference as a podium presentation (she told me this during the phone interview – I couldn’t find it on her CV as a presentation, but also didn’t ask her to expand on this presentation any further).  DNP work was a Pilot study – would like to work on that and expand that, not currently in a position to be able to do that as she is currently limited by lack of technology resources.
“Technology is the way we need to connect” – would like to be in an environment where there were experts/resources in technology to be able to move this forward

11.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
“A significant portion” of her primary care practice was GLBTQ.  Provided support groups and education out of her practice.  Was active with the community for her practice to partner and support opening an AIDS community alliance.  Also in her work with ‘care-givers’ she recognizes that there is a great deal of diversity in the notion of family (gender, ethnicity) and feels fortunate as a primary care provider to have been able to have a very diverse patient population 

12.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?
Has “always found a way to be involved with the profession, and teach but it’s been in addition to full-time clinical work”  looks forward to being in an academic setting, having the opportunity for career to include not only the opportunity for but expectation of teaching, scholarship and practice. Discussed that having other DNP/clinical faculty as role-models and support to bring teaching and practice into balance. 

13.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?
FNP – ANCC and Emergency Nurse Practitioner (only available since October 2014) – goal to maintain both of those. Currently work per-diem (16-36h/month) at local emergency departments.  Interest in this position in particular because of the blend of teaching and practice.

14.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.
1.	Please clarify about the DNP education programs (2 are listed). 
	Significant changes in DNP program faculty at initial school – Waynesburg University – Capstone work no longer fit with the focus of the school so she transferred.
2.	Were you course faculty for the teaching you list, or guest presenter?
“have done all those things (course faculty and clinical teaching) throughout my career” – involved as clinical faculty and lecturer.  Most course-development and classroom experience with Widener University.  Worked with developing courses to be offered at the Harrisburg campus. Dr. Bock and the program director designed the pathophysiology course (case-study approach) for the other campus.  Also taught physical assessment and professional issues course – has been both responsible for whole courses and been guest lecturer.   
Has done clinical teaching of all kinds of professionals (EMT, nurses, NPs) and precepted students in the ED, primary care, etc
3.	What are your scholarship goals and what would help you attain those?
Did not address the position specifically in cover letter. Only one comment in the cover letter re: Veterans – what does she understand the practice/teaching/administrative aspect of this position to be?
	How has the experience in her current position prepared her for this position?
“certainly have to be flexible when you work in a place where politics is the norm” – owning own business and working with government has helped her know when and under what circumstances don’t allow for compromise ie. Patient safety. And learning how to advocate for patients and patient populations that are underserved, what is best, what is ethical and what is fiscally responsible
Art of Compromise!

15.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.
Mission trip to Honduras in October 
Would want to give her employers a month’s notice. Could be available (no strings attached) by mid-November
Start Spring Semester

16.	Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.?
yes
17.	Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.) N/A

18.	Please rate the candidate in the areas related to diversity and inclusion listed below, adding additional comments, if needed.  

	Poor	Fair	Good	Excellent	Unable to rate
a.	Promotes diversity and inclusion among student populations.  
Comments: did not mention students specifically – did discuss patients and patient families and care-givers

Applicant Reviewer Worksheet     completed by R. Richesson, Sept 3, 2015                                                

Applicant :   Lisa Boss, PhD, RN, ACNS, CEN       Position:  Assist Prof Track I

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
She has modest amounts of funding and a few publications in journals with moderate impact factors.

She has received a number of grant awards to support her dissertation and research over the past 2  years.  She lists 3 current grants that started in 2015 (this year) totaling around $18,000 combined, from the following funders: Human Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI) and the Dr. Mara Baun Faculty Endowment (internal UT funding I presume). She is co-PI on all of them so it is not clear how much of the grant writing she was responsible for. 

She is co-PI on another active grant, started in 2014, from the International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ) &amp; Waltham for $45,000 Annual Direct Costs.

Past funding with her as sole PI is a small $11,500 support for her dissertation from the Speros Martel Endowment for the Aging; Texas Nurses Association District #9 Foundation Research Grant; and the Dean’s Research Award, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Annual Direct Costs: $6000

No NIH or federal grant funding at all or mentions of applications planned or in progress.
No current or previous funding from nursing organizations.

Oddly enough, she does not explicitly state the title of her dissertation in her cover letter or on her CV. So, I am not sure which of the publications, if any, represent her dissertation.

4 publications (3 first author)  all during 2014-2015.  Her first author publications are in the following journals: 

Western Journal of Nursing Research, International Psychogeriatrics, and  Aging Clinical and Experimental Research.

Of those publications, 2 are reviews. An additional 2 publications are in press, one of which she is second author and it is not in her area of research (it is on nutrition reporting measures). The other in-press manuscript is in International Journal of Nursing.

Excluding several local presentations and  about 6-8 posters over the past 3 years, she seems to have only one PEER-reviewed presentations (Sigma Theta Tau International’s 26th International Nursing Research Congress).

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

She received her PhD in 2013.  Here overall research question is to understand the physiologic impact of psychosocial factors on cognitive function in the vulnerable homebound elderly. Her initial studies have focused on stress, depression, loneliness, religious coping, salivary biomarkers of stress and inflammation, and executive function.

I see a theme and emerging program of research, but it is not very developed at this point.

3.	Teaching experience

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

Has clinical teaching experience in community nursing and adult nursing.  Could teach emergency nursing or gerontology.  Biofeeback and biomarkers for stress. Potentially could teach research methods courses.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  

No specific mention of diversity or intercultural development activities is included in the CV or cover letter. 


10.	 Please rate the candidate in the areas related to diversity and inclusions listed below.  Feel free to add additional comments where indicated.  
	Poor	Fair	Good	Excellent	Unable to rate
a.	Evidence of impact related to diversity research/scholarship 
Comments: 

Her area of research is with the elderly. 

In her cover letter she states “Teaching the next generation about vulnerability and diversity is
critical to the fabric of our society.”
		
x			
b.	Potential for obtaining external funding/grants for educational programs that advance diversity and promote inclusion
Comments:
She might have potential for funding for gerontology research, which is a vulnerable population, but I am not considering that in my answer to this. 
	x				
	Poor	Fair	Good	Excellent	Unable to rate
c.	Commitment to bridging academic programs and diversity and inclusion.  
Comments:
No mention in CV and nothing evident on cover letter.
					x
d.	Has prior experience with diverse environments.
Comments:
She very well might, given her 12 years clinical practice in emergency rooms, but I see no evidence on her CV or letter. 
					x
e.	Experience with educational programs that meet the needs of diverse student populations
Comments: 

I assume not since nothing is mentioned on her CV or cover. I was tempted to rate her as poor, but in the end, I chose unable to rate, since I cannot truly assume this.

					x


11.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):

Experience or commitment to diversity. Especially in the classroom, but also in her work and research with the elderly. This is not clear from her application.

Intent/plan for NIH grants?



Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  


Cease recruitment.  She does have extensive clinical experience and impressive amount of activity in service roles and conferences in the past few years, but she does not have strong evidence of strong research nor does she show potential for NIH or federal grant funding. The latter of which is a key requirement for the position.

She has worked hard, and is growing a nice collection of small research projects that might develop into a program of research some day, but I do not see any true excellence in her work.

I think that she is not an ideal candidate for the position, and hence recommend that we wait for other more qualified candidates.</Comment>

<Comment>Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.  Candidate recently finished her PhD from UNC-CH in May 2015. She was a T32 pre-doctoral fellow.  She has one grant listed from the Heart Failure Society of America’s Nurse Research Grant focused on biomarkers associated with heart failure.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship –  One literature review first author publication for 2015 all focused on hear failure – the second one she list is not a journal article, it’s just where her dissertation was posted on ProQuest – and thei first one is “in press” but she doesn’t cite this in APA so you really have to read closely what she has listed. Not sure why she is listing publications “in preparation” – but clearly demonstrates this is a VERY junior candidate who’s mentorship team did not review her CV prior to submission for this position.

She also lists an unpublished predoctoral fellowship project from 2010, and unpublished master thesis from 2004.  7 presentations listed all focused on cardiovascular areas (6 of 7 as first author). The presentation for Greece just says the abstract was accepted – so it’s unclear if she presented or not. 

3.	Teaching experience – she has worked as a clinical associate with DUSON since 1996 with NP students in cardiovascular specialty and primary care. 

4.	Mentorship experience – no mentorship experience evident on her CV

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice – clinical practice has primarily been at Duke in cardiovascular arena, and primarily as a NP

6.	Service to the profession – she has served as a reviewer for three publications, has served on Duke IRB. The other things she has listed as “Leadership Projects” are extremely confusing and very unclear in what her role was on these various projects. The majority appear to be local service within Duke University hospital and nothing at a local community, state, ,regional, or national level.

7.	Job stability – appears to have been gainfully employed primarily as a RN or NP since 1985 in nursing. Has some clinical research background.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – she has worked with colleagues at DUSON including Bradi Granger &amp; Midge Bowers – and from UNC (Barksdale, Neelon,  

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:    She has been in her doctoral program for five years, two of which were on a T32 grant for which she has one published literature review. She has not demonstrated the ability to be a productive scholar with that much time and support already. I recommend ceasing recruitment.</Comment>

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

As stated in her letter, her research focuses on the physiologic impact of psychosocial factors  on cognitive function on homebound elderly. However, her pubs/presentations to date, do not reflect her focus.  This may be due to the fact that her program of research is at the developmental stage.

Clearly, her research population is in gerontology.  Her focus in gero is less certain. She is presently conducting 4 small scale studies as co-PI such as  Biobehavioral effects of therapy dog visitation in elderly intensive care unit patients ($5,923, Human Animal Bond Research Initiative ); Efficacy of animal assisted activity on heart rate variability responses in undergraduate nursing students(Dr. Mara Baun Faculty Endowment, $5,170);  Effects of animal assisted activity on biobehavioral stress responses of hospitalized children   (Dr. Mara Baun Faculty Endowment, $7,558).

Describe her planned strategies in moving her program of research forward (describe focus, mentorship need, resource need). What her plans for obtaining external funding?

Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

Yes to phone interview. This applicant, in my opinion, meets the minimal threshold to be considered for Assist Prof, Tenure track. She has pubs and has obtained small scale funding.  Cannot gauge her potential for research advancement based on her CV so I would be curious to hear her plan to move her program of research.

<Comment>Applicant :            Gretchel Ajon Gealogo      			 Position:  Asst/Assoc Prof Tenure Track

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
PhD in nursing science from The University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio this May 2015.

Has 6 published articles – 3 of which appear to be opinion papers. No data-based article. Since she just finished her PhD, there is no publication yet resulting from her dissertation.

Research support in CV were mostly support for research expenses incurred while a student scholar  and not about her program of research. 

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship
Unclear but based on her presentations with abstracts, I think it is about dementia care. Her letter states that her dissertation was an organizational ethnography of an adult day care program serving elders with dementia.

3.	Teaching experience 
Nurse educator and TA but no formal teaching experience in academic setting.

4.	Mentorship experience 
Unclear 

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

Clinical experience began in 2009 as RN until to date. Also has experience as clinical preceptor and nurse educator. Currently CEO of a AG Nurse Consult (began in 2005).

She has certification in Pain Management

6.	Service to the profession
Member in several national organizations such as STTI, AGS, APS, etc.

7.	Job stability
Note: Nursing is second career – first career was in Military (BA in Government/History in 1998 and also obtained Master in Human Relations in 2003). BSN in 2009.  

Has maintained nursing position since 2009.

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 
Unclear based on materials submitted. Not sure where her teaching expertise is as she has not had any teaching experience. Her research focus is dementia care so she may fit in Division 2, which is the Adult/Gero /Chronic illness division.

9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
I would say yes as evidenced by her involvement in the military with several awards given.

11.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):

N/A
Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  

I recommend that we cease for the following reasons:
1.	No clear trajectory for her program of research 
2.	No academic teaching experience. Uncertain on her teaching expertise.
3.	No research funding to date. Her documented funding support  were mainly meant to provide assistance to her as a PhD student.
4.	She has 6 pubs, the last 3 were opinion papers.
5.	In my opinion, her best fit is at the Instructor level but we do not offer that.

<Comment>Applicant :                 Michael McIntosh 			 Position:  Assistant Professor, Track I

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.
	
Completed PhD in 2006 from Temple, with two small grants totaling $6K (one internal to SON - $2K; one external to SON but within University $6K) – both funded from 2014-2015 (he has dates backwards on one of these, so unsure if the $2k was over one year or just a month like the $6K one. Publication list is also confusing: looks like he has one chapter(?) that is “expected” to be published in February of next year. Given that he lists this “expected” chapter as “published” –  the second publication is truly only  “in press”. (When I google the third “publication”, it comes up as an accepted paper for a conference in Singapore in 2016. Nothing in CINAHL or PubMED.  The 4th listing is a true publication, written as a doctoral student. The 1999 publication is a true publication and is in CINAHL – a clinically focused paper, and not research focused.

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

No focused program of scholarship or research is evident in his CV. He has one published paper from 1999, and since completing his PhD, he has not published the results of his dissertation – in fact, no listing of what the dissertation was about on his CV. 

3.	Teaching experience 
4.	
Has teaching experience, but given the poor organization of things he has stated he published, the integrity of his CV is in question and no way to verify what he is asserting/ time to figure it out.

5.	Mentorship experience 

He has chaired one DNP project as Chair, 2014-2015.

6.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice

He’s done a lot of service, but nothing that resulted in scholarhip of any kind.

7.	Service to the profession

Only service reported is within the Temple SON and a lot of volunteer work in his local area.

8.	Job stability

Seems to change jobs about every year or two. He has his job listing mixed in with serving on the IRB/ service 

9.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

None are evident from his CV

10.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  
11.	
Seems committed to diversity with all of his activities. While focused on a diverse population, he has zero focused scholarship as an academic.

<Comment>Applicant Reviewer Worksheet       - completed by R.Richesson, Oct 2, 2015                                  

Applicant :  Esther Thatcher, PhD, RN, APHN-BC                	 Position:  Assist Prof – Track 1
	

Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity.

•	New graduate (PhD) University of Virginia, Charlottesville (2014)
•	One year into a 2-year Post-Doc at UNC
•	Research focus is on social determinants of healthy food access. Overall research aim is to prevent and reduce the burden of nutrition-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, among socioeconomically vulnerable populations. 

•	Was awarded and is supported by a T31 training  grant from NINR for $11,579. (Interventions to Prevent and Manage Chronic Illness) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing

•	No first author publications
•	Has “partnered with mentors” on 7 peer-reviewed publications (non first-author)
•	Has 2 first-authored manuscripts currently **in review** 
•	Has presented at national, regional, and local research conferences.  (impressive; includes APHA)


Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI: E. Sue Cantrell). Healthy Food Access in Lenowisco Health District.Appalachian Prosperity Project (no number). 2013, $2,000.

No significant external or internal grant funding (other than her T32) but she mentioned she came close:
“I took a lead role to apply for a major grant ($685,853) from a coalition of funders including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. This proposal on Appalachian community health resilience was selected as a finalist for the single award, though not funded.”

2.	Focused program of research or scholarship

•	PhD dissertation project: “Spatial and Psychosocial Influences on Food Access in Rural Appalachia” described community food access through qualitative interviews with low-income women, geographic information systems (GIS) mapping of food stores, and a food store survey. 

•	Cover letter mentions that she plans to apply for R21 pilot funding for:  to develop and evaluate a cost-effective, scalable intervention to train home care workers on nutrition and food preparation skills. Home care workers prepare food for older adult and disabled clients, whose nutritional care can significantly affect their risk for hospitalization. 

3.	Teaching experience 

Limited formal course teaching experience, but that is expected with someone not in the instructor/professor role:
I am prepared to teach in nursing courses on a variety of topics, such as community/public health nursing, adult health, and research courses. I learned the foundations of college educator roles in UVA Teaching Resource Center’s Tomorrow’s Professor Today certificate program. As coordinator for UVA School of Nursing’s project to redesign its BSN curriculum, I worked closely with a large team of tenure-track and clinical faculty to organize the content and logistics of the new curriculum. I currently serve on UNC’s PhD Executive Committee, where I am learning about the structure and design of PhD education. As a UVA teaching assistant for six semesters, I was involved in syllabus preparation, guest lecturing, grading, online instruction, and individual tutoring.

4.	Mentorship experience   - N/A

5.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice  - 9 years community nursing

6.	Service to the profession
Has served on numerous committees at UVA and UNC.  Has served as reviewer for several journals.

7.	Job stability  - N/A

8.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON 

Experience with community nursing, food and nutrition, and vulnerable populations would be an asset.  Mixed methods research experience.
Fluent Spanish speaker.


9.	Commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  

Nice thoughtful paragraph on diversity in her cover letter:

“My commitment to diversity is integrated in my philosophy about leadership and working with others: when we support each other’s success, we all become more successful. I value diversity among colleagues, students, and community partners. Diversity promotes social justice and equal opportunity for all people, and provides tangible benefits to organizations’ abilities to grow and achieve their missions. I try to be aware of my own unconscious biases, and make intentional efforts to create situations where everyone feels safe, welcome, and respected. As an educator, I recognize that students have diverse strengths and ways of learning; I plan to use innovative teaching approaches, such as flipped classrooms and hands-on activities, to help all students succeed and find their passion in health care.”

She has very little teaching experience at all given her recent graduation.
					x


11.	If this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):

Certification and practice 



Reviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  
Discuss in committee.  She is a new graduate only 1 year into a post doc.  She has no first author publications but a couple submitted.  Perhaps it is too early for her to apply?  Not sure what our expectations for scholarship achievements are. She has a number of conference presentations and nice research interests (nutrition, vulnerable populations) and history of community service.

She does have potential for future scholarship and external funding, but I am not sure this is the strongest candidate.  I defer to the committee discussion.</Comment>

Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet             completed by Richesson, 10-15-2015                                        

Applicant:   Rosa Gonzalez-Guarda                                 Position:  Associate Professor (tenure)

1.	What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

Wants to grow an independent research program and address health disparities in Hispanic immigrant populations. 
Long term she wants to do more with biomarkers and biological factors of stress response.  

Interests are to address health disparities in Hispanic populations; in particular she wants to explore underlying MH conditions in Hispanic pop and role that stress plays on health outcomes in Hispanic immigrants.
Wants to advance her understanding of those biological mechanisms, and then build interventions to address.
Hispanic immigrants are usually healthier when they arrive here than after they become acculturated. She believes this is stress.   

2nd interest area– prevention /intervention for intimate partner violence. Most work is community based participatory research. She has done a lot of this.  But would like to do more. She feels ready to pull out of her community research in Miami and know that she has made an impact there. ..  Now she wants to explore new ideas and implement them in “different” Hispanic populations. 

2.	Why are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)
N/A
3.	Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  

Duke has faculty doing bio-psychosocial type research.  Interested in impact on Telomeres and she thinks her NINR funding options will be higher here. 
Wants to be in an environment with more research and have …. More time to do that.
Despite that her interests are very well-aligned with her current school of nursing in Miami, she wants to be exposed to more diversity and different ways of thinking – to stimulate diversity.  Wants to be in a new and diverse environment and wants to brings multi-disciplinary perspectives. 
Also, in her school there are only 7 tenured faculty (including the Dean).  She is taking on more leadership roles than she thinks she should at this point in her professional / research development.  She spends about 60% of time leading mentioning programs to encourage new students to get into health disparities and mentoring PhD students but she feels that she should be more focused on her research.
4.	What are your strengths?
Is a “very warm and happy person”. Therefore she is flexible and positive. Can adapt to challenges and enjoy successes. So she thrives on different environment and change.
5.	What are your weaknesses?
Associated weakness is that she can at times be overly optimistic, and at times can be disappointed if things do not work out. Her enthusiasm for new opportunities can lead her to over-commitments. 
6.	What is your most significant accomplishment?  (She has 2 accomplishments to report – 1 for research and one for service.)

1.) research - the community based participatory relationship she has promoted in her community related to EBP for intimate partner violence. This took a lot of time and energy to build. She is proud of community partnership (and its impact); and the fact that she has managed to get research publications out of it.

2.) service – Was on the IOM Committee for Future of Nursing. She was worried at first about her potential/ability to contribute to the committee. But she was proud hat she did add to the report and initiative. She worked ion diversity of Nursing Workforce and using nursing to reduce impact of health disparities.  She has now seen the impact of that report on communities and grant funding, and she is proud of 

7.	What is your teaching passion?
a.	Class size
b.	Clinical groups
c.	Online
d.	Discuss teaching philosophy
Has had a lot of experience teaching across programs and levels. Undergrad. Diadactic and clinical. Teaches a lot with MSPH graduate students. And developed  that program. 
Also has taught some in PhD program.

She enjoys Pubic health nursing, research, and health disparities. Those are where she has more to offer.  She likes small classes better but can do large.

Enjoys most the mentorship component to exposing students to research for the first time. She likes working with them 1:1.  Likes to break stereotype that research removes nurse from care – community research can be engaging and have IMPACT on pt care.

Teaching philosophy – best strategy for learning is teaching. So she likes to encourage students to play a role in the teaching (in class_).

Has done some online teaching several (&gt;5) years ago.  Was a distance based.  In BSN.  Has done synchronous online teachings. 

8.	What are your research interests? Program of research plans?
Submitted R01 (NINR) in October 2015  (Aims: to explore the longitudinal relationships among acculturation, stress, health promotion practices, biological aging (as measured by telomere length) and health status among Hispanic immigrants.)
She wants to move forward program of research around understanding impact of unique mix of stressors that Hispanic immigrants face and how can programs address those. First she wants to understand the etiology of problems and then develop intervention and then evaluate their efficacy.
Very interested in role of context of these stressors. E.g., in Miami, Hispanics are the majority but in NC not much. How are health outcomes differ… 

Will come here with no current funding. 
Current funding all relates to training. Has a big T37 grant (Through Office of Minority Health….) .   5 year grant. 
Also has a supplement to a health disparities research center (HIV/survivors of intimate partner violence. Doing data analysis and publications now.


9.	For recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?
N/A
10.	Please discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  


11.	What resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?
Mentorship, particularly in biomarker research.  In Miami she formed relationship with a geneticist.  
She would need funding support until her grants get funded.
Access to labs for her research.  

Someone that can help her connect to local community agencies. 

12.	What are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

Clinical specialty is advanced practice public health nursing. There is a certification (CPH) which she has. She does not have Adv Practice PH certification because it is not well-recognize but she can pursues. .

13.	Integrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.

14.	Discuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.
No urgency.  Anxious for a visit soon.  Move would have to time out with children’s school time. 

15.	Are you legally authorized to work in the U.S.? yes

16.	Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.)

17.	Please rate the candidate in the areas related to diversity and inclusion listed below, adding additional comments, if needed.  

	Poor	Fair	Good	Excellent	Unable to rate
a.	Promotes diversity and inclusion among student populations.  
Comments: 

Is very concerned with lack of diversity in nursing student population.  In particularly the Hipsanic are 5% of nursing student pop (and 16% pop at large). Has worked on a number of diversity initiatives. Florida Blue Fnd to diversify students in nursing, particualrty PhD.  

Active at pogram level and policy level (IOM; NCNEP committee recommendations to congress). 

Is aware that just because students in class does not mean their needs are being met. Tries to bring this issue to faculty attention. 
Articulate about what diversity means – more than just racial/ethnic/gender.  Also, diversity of thought. 

Can speak to theme of inclusion. 

Read our diversity statement and likes our r				
X	


Committee member’s recommendation and rationale:
Invite for campus visit soon. She is passionate and articulate about her research. Committed to diversity and inclusion. Demonstrated expert in Community-based participatory research.
She has great potential and shows success in grant writing and project mgt. But, needs to move her funding from training and workforce development to the R-level research grants.
Although she has no current and no history of “pure research” funding, she clearly has leadership and collaborative potential and grantsmanship skills and a VERY HIGH probability of successful and independently funded research career. 
She would be a great asset to DUSON.</Comment>
