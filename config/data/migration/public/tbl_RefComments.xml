<ReferenceText>Scott Saccomano provided us with 5 references.  I called all 5 and have heard back from 4 of them – 2 folks from SUNY New Paltz (his current position), 1 from Seton Hall (his doctoral dissertation chair), and 1 from Southern CT State U (where he worked for 2 years).  The 1 I’ve not yet heard from is the nursing dean at Seton Hall (where he worked for 4 years while completing his doctorate at that school … not in nursing).  I left her a message a week ago and will follow up with her if you think it’s needed.  I think I’ve heard very consistent messages (except for 1 concern) and follow up with this person is not necessary, but I’ll do it if the group wishes.  

Overall, the references for Scott are excellent.  He is described (by almost everyone) as a fabulous teacher whom students (undergraduate &amp; graduate) love … a good role model, particularly for the male students … easy to get along with … motivated … someone who inspired others in his doctoral program to move forward … a team player … collegial (in fact, his doctoral dissertation chair and he are working on a paper together) … someone who mentored fellow doctoral students who were earlier in their program (without being asked or required to do that) … able to interact positively with everyone … thought provoking … someone who inspires dialogue … passionate about the clinical nursing environment and what enhances it … up to date regarding clinical practice … someone who earned the respect of fellow faculty and those outside the university … flexible … willing to “jump in” when things need to be done … dependable … someone who puts things in good, healthy perspective … someone with a “strong presence” … versatile … tech savvy … someone who can use humor effectively ... an experienced teacher whose “hand does not need to be held” …calm … and energetic.

The individual who was the dean at Southern CT State U when Scott was there described some concern.  She said he was hired initially on a tenure track line.  He worked well but then was paired with a faculty member who was not “carrying her weight” in the course.  Rather than working to deal with that situation, Scott resigned.  Within a short time after resigning, he called the dean, saying he wanted to come back.  By that time, it was too late for him to come back to the tenure track line, so he was hired on a 1-year appointment and encouraged to apply for tenure track while on that appointment.  Scott never did apply for the tenure track position and left again (and permanently) after that second year.  This dean expressed concern that he is “unpredictable” and unable or unwilling to deal with conflict, particularly with faculty colleagues.  I wanted to share this since it was information I gleaned from the reference, but I do want to point out that none of the other references made any comments that were at all along these lines.  

Finally, when asked what they thought Scott’s greatest contribution to DUSON could be if he were appointed, I received the following responses:  thought provoking … ability to bring in grant funding if mentored … experience as a teacher … some involvement at the university level, so knows the “bigger picture” at least a bit … ability and willingness to inspire and mentor others … clinical expertise … and leadership and management skills.  Except for the concern noted above, everyone else said they had no hesitation to recommend Scott, and they saw no real weaknesses in him.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Hansell is the dean of the SON at Seton Hall, where Scott taught for a few years while he was completing his PhD (in a department outside nursing).  Dr. Hansell said she never observed Scott teaching, but the students liked him, he is &quot;entertaining,&quot; and on RateMyProfessor he gets good &quot;marks&quot; from students … She said he should be &quot;fine&quot; in the classroom, and his experience teaching ABSN students should be helpful for the position we are seeking to fill.  She also said the faculty liked him, he got along well with collegues, and was actively involved in the work of the school.  In terms of scholarship, Dr. Hansell noted that she did not think Scott could &quot;hit the ground running&quot; and would need mentoring and guidance to develop and pursue a program of research; however, she does believe he has the potential for solid scholarly work.  Her final comments expressed a &quot;minor concern&quot; … She indicated he was open about taking the job so that he could get free tuition for his PhD program, and when he finished, she said Scott &quot;jumped ship rather abruptly.&quot;  When I asked what she meant, she said that he did not give a lot of notice, and it caught them by surprise a bit.  I know Dr.Hansell from many years ago, and she does not have a particularly exuberant personality, therefore, I was not surprised that she was rather low-key about Scott and not as &quot;bubbly&quot; as several of his other references. While she was not overly enthusiastic about him, she also had many positive things to say and indicated she thought he would do well as a faculty member here at Duke.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Letvek was very positive about Terry Ward who was award the PhD on yesterday, May 14. She noted Dr. Ward’s strengths as an excellent, articulate, and talented educator, who is a natural leader, a creative problem solver, up-beat, and a well respected  professional across the state. She described her as well grounded in her specialty, Psychiatric Nursing, the area she primarily teaches at Watts, and which was the focus of her dissertation. Dr. Letvek stated that because of her many talents as an educator and a leader, she encouraged her several years ago that she needed to move beyond Watts to a university setting. She felt that the applicant is very passionate about her research on bipolar disease among patients who live in shelters and prone to self- medicate.  Dr. Letvek noted how driven and dedicate the applicant was as a doctoral student and indicated  that she had written several small grants to support her research. Again, she stressed that teaching is her major interest but that a university setting would allow her to excel in both. She mentioned her commitment to minority recruitment and retention. When asked if there was anything else she wanted to add, she boldly said, “we would hire her in a heart-beat, if she would just do the commute.” Dr. Ward does not wish to commute to Greensboro.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>A very favorable characterization of Dr. Ward was provided. The relationship dates back 10 plus years when Ms. Neal hired Ms. Ward as a manager of orthopedics, where she quickly demonstrated excellence. She engaged staff and was able to lead the group in problem solving and the development care models for the unit. Because of her stellar qualities, she was transferred to Watts School of Nursing, but maintained close linkages with nursing service. She served for years on the research council, mentored staff at both the hospital and the school and served as interim director of the school. She is described as very smart and listens and works well with others. Students regard her highly bestowing awards of excellence in teaching. As a teacher, she is very professional, instilling professional standards and works effectively with students in identifying and correcting weaknesses.  Her ability to aid students in understanding the art and science of nursing is evident through her association with the Kaplan NCLEX review program. Increase in board schools at NCCU are credited in large measure to the work of Dr. Ward. She currently has two IRB approved research projects presumably involving Durham Regional. She is highly recommended by Ms. McNeil.</ReferenceText>

She followed her development as a doctoral student and urged her to seek a post-doc. Dr. Kearney described U. Kelly as an exceedingly strong  academic scholar and that her preparation was of the highest order. Her direct knowledge of UK’s teaching was as a guest lecturer, through presentations of her doctoral work, and some instruction at the MSN level. UK was described as forthright and clear. Kearney has indirect knowledge of outstanding performance as the director of and as an instructor in NP education at Mass General and through teaching in second degree programs. As a PhD student, UK stood out as a very good writer, as being very dedicated with high standards. She is published and is believed to have potential for increasing level of productivity around the important work of spousal abuse and an emphasis on Hispanic women.  UK is believed to be positioned to make a major contribution to the profession. Overall, has great potential, but could benefit from more attention to confidence building and realizing that she has something significant to contribute. Dr. Kearney did not know of her interest in Duke, but was aware of her intention to apply to Penn, Hopkins, &amp; UNC. She was encouraged to apply to Rochester, but not sure if she did.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Nicholas described Dr. Kelly as a superb teacher, researcher, clinician, and committed to a career in academia. 
Dr. Nicholas is most familiar with Ursula Kelly through her teaching role at MGH Institute for Health Professions. Both are nurse practitioners and taught together in the APRN program; direct entry track and the RN to MSN track. She was thought to be a terrific colleague; understood curriculum; superb at integrating theory into practice; able to prepare course syllabi from start to finish; keeping the course updated; an effective lecturer, and clinical expert. Though not first hand knowledge, she believes Dr. Kelly can cross over and effectively teach in undergraduate programs as well as graduate programs. 
Dr. Kearney also spoke to having knowledge of her scholarly writings. Dr. Kelly has used Dr. Kearney to review manuscripts for her. There seem to be three manuscripts being prepared from the dissertation, and one accepted for publication in Advances in Nursing Science. She also believes the Post-doc was very good for Dr. Kelly in the further development of her area on research on intimate partner violence and cultural issues. She focuses on Hispanic women. She speaks fluent Spanish. She is also generous with community service. She described her as an excellent practitioner.

Dr. Nicholas recommends Ursula Kelly highly without reservation for a faculty position at Duke. She did suggest that it would be helpful to have a community of colleagues to continue to guide and encourage her research.

Following that collaboration Ms. McKenna worked with Dr. Wise on editing of the text  &quot;Nursing Care of the General Pediatric Surgery Patient&quot;.  Dr. Wise was primary editor on this textbook.  Ms. McKenna stated that &quot;Barbara is an excellent writer and she had to re-write and add material to many chapters that the authors had difficulty completing by the required deadlines.&quot;  Dr. Wise completed this project while completing her PhD at the University of Maryland.  Ms. McKenna described Dr. Wise&apos;s pediatric experiences as very broad.  She has worked in the NICU as a staff nurse, pediatric general surgery and transplant as a CNS, and in pediatric urology and oncology as a nurse practitioner.  She has expert technical skills to place PICC lines and perform LPs as well as expertise in cultural differences and psychosocial needs of families.  Her only clinical weakness was described as the lack of any primary care practice experience.  However, Dr. Wise has completed several mission trips to Honduras where she provided primary and acute care to as many children as they could see and just recently Dr. Wise went on a trip to Cambodia where she provided education for Cambodian nurses.

Telephone Reference for Kay Mueggenburg

Ms. Snapp has know Dr. Mueggenburg (M’burg) for 5 years in her role as VP for Education, Research, and Community Education and through collaborative work in the Oncology Nursing Organization. M’burg was described as absolutely relentless in her energy and commitment to the work of the hospice and the community. Defined her as well read, very current in her knowledge base, well connected and respected by other health professionals, serves as mentor and teacher to all professionals (nurses, physicians, social workers, etc). Her knowledge and understanding of Community Health is evident through the integration of community in the work of the hospice and also through the inter-phases with the health department.

She is considered a mentor and educator; she develops curricula for programs and training sessions for the hospice and for large conferences held for the region.  Her programs qualify for CEUs and CMEs. The agency has learned so much from Kay and she is well respected as a curriculum developer, teacher and evaluator. 

Before coming to Hospice of the Bluegrass, she was on faculty at the University of Kentucky.

When asked about her research, Ms. Snapp was less informed. Noted that she saw her as more of a facilitator of research project of others (fellows and students from Uni Kentucky in all disciplines) than as an independent researcher.

It was noted that if she left it would be a terrible loss for hospice. Stated that Kay wanted to get back into academia. There are also some things changing in the environment of the hospice that Kay does not agree with and she feels limited somewhat in what she is able to do</ReferenceText>

As Director of Professional Development, she knows KM&apos;s professional strengths through her role as faculty with the Hospice Managers Development Program at NHPCO. KM teaches in on-line courses and serves on a variety of committees. She spoke in superlatives in describing KM pioneering role and leadership in moving  the organization to an on-line format in its training program. KM came with the background and know how and mentored others in linking the pieces toegther for an effective on-line program. She demonstrated knowledge and skill in curriculum development and in translating what was traditionally face to face classes to on-line formats. All respect her knowledge base and leadership capacity. KM was described as one of 3 persons in the organization who is an exceptional  senior faculty member and with whom paried with new educators in a mentoring role. Feedback from participants in classes  describe her as high energy and highly motivated and highly effective. She generates a lot of comments. Most rave about her ability to effectively translate theory into practice in ways that people can use in concrete ways. Ms. Bouton, while not really knowing her as a community health nurse, felt that she effectively used community health principles with the community-based hospices and the family-based approach to care. She was felt to get along very well with interdisciplinary teams and that non-nursing team members responded to her very positively and looked to her for much of their training. Her ability to work effectively with multiple disciplines was deemed a strength. Noted that she is well known and respected throughout the state. There was not knowledge of her scholarship; either writings or research. Ms. Bouton could not think of any area needing further development. Just thought she was fabulous.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Arras knows KM as a colleague dating back to their time together at Southern Ill. Uni. They were co-teachers in Community Health Nursing(1996-2001). KM came with many more prior public health experiences and exposure to the community; as such, she was mentor and able to use her wealth of experience to help shape the course and clinical experiences.  KM was described as &quot;a teachers teacher,&quot;  very smart, capable of making the didatic come alive and the clinical thrilling, &quot;champion of on-line teaching&quot;, hard working, and an excellent manager who could juggle multiple responsibilities and remain calm at all times. When questioned about her rapport with students and the type of ABSN students at Duke, Dr. Arras simply stated, &quot;she will dazzle them.&quot; She further explained that KM is highly motivated, creative, able to explain concepts at multiple levels in an effort to connect with all students, fair, helpful, and highly respected by students. Stated she is not an easy instructor but very fair. Dr. Arras and KM attended their doctoral programs together and that is where the interest in on-line education began. KM excelled and uses it in multiple ways for teaching. She believes that KM is scholarly in the way she uses evidence in teaching and practice, and through her numerous presentations. She noted she has some publications, but explained that Southern Ill places more emphasis on teaching than on research. However, she felt with support and collaborators she would be successful at a place like Duke. She highly recommends KM, feels there are no areas for which we should be concerned and that there is simply &quot;no finer person.&quot; 

KM was also described as very connected with the community and works exceedingly well with individuals from many disciplines and walks of life.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>This is a letter that was sent from Ms. Madden.  She is a nurse practicioner colleague of Dr. Mize.

Dear Dr. Brandon,

I am writing to you in reference to Marisa Mize RN, DNP, CPNP who has submitted her application for consideration as a full time faculty member in the Duke University School of Nursing.  I have known Marisa since 1997 and would like to convey my wholehearted support of her application to your department.   

 I had the pleasure to work with Marisa in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Maryland for three years.  During those three years we also worked together as Clinical Instructors in Pediatrics for Marymount University School of Nursing.  Marisa is an excellent pediatric nurse practitioner and a superb educator.  She uses well developed assessment skills to gather knowledge of each patient’s physical and psychosocial status.  She consistently identifies problems, prioritizes them and then plans care to mitigate the patients’ problems.  Marisa has a very broad and strong fund of knowledge in pediatric nursing, pediatric critical care and emergency medicine.  She possesses an extensive knowledge of pathophysiology and psychosocial theory and readily applies it in the planning, evaluation and rendering of patient care.  Patients, nursing staff, practitioners, physicians and other members of the multiprofessional health care team like and respect Marisa personally and professionally.  Her concern is consistently for the welfare of the patient and she readily articulates that concern.

Over the past nine years, I have continued to have professional interactions with Marisa.  It has been my pleasure to collaborate with Marisa on sections of the Procedure Manual for Pediatric Critical Care, supported by the American Association of Critical Care Nursing.  I have also had the opportunity to participate with Marisa in regional and national conferences.  She is a skilled and experienced speaker who is able to readily engage her audience and convey her topic in a confident, practiced and professional manner.  Marisa consistently challenges her learners to achieve their maximum potential.  The high level of skill and knowledge that she expects from her students is no less than she demands of herself.  Marisa has developed a wide compilation of lecture topics which address the spectrum of beginning nursing student to experienced advanced practice professional.

Marisa is a truthful and trustworthy person.  She holds herself to the highest standards for both professional practice and education.  She is compassionate, genuine and strives for the highest level of practice.  It is gratifying to me both personally and professionally that I have been able to work and collaborate with Marisa.  She has been an incredible source of strength and a respected colleague.  

I know that she would be a wonderful asset to your school and your students. I support her application without reservation.  I hope that you will strongly and favorably consider her application as faculty for the School of Nursing. If there is any further information that I may provide, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Thank you for your time and consideration of Marisa’s faculty application.


Sincerely,

<ReferenceText>Maggie Kelly-Hayes, Dr. Kelly-Hayes knew Dr. Bettger when she worked for the American Heart Association. She sees herself as the one who encouraged Bettger to get her doctorate. Boston University does not have a tenure system and Dr. Kelly-Hayes says soft money living is a way of life there. She knows Dr. Bettger wants a traditional faculty position.  She has seen Dr. Bettger teach and collaborate across disciplines and sees that as her major strength. She thinks Dr. Bettger writes well and could become a productive PI with some mentoring in a system like Duke where senior mentors are readily available.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText> Dr. Naylor has worked with Dr. Bettger for the past two years as part of the School of Medicine T-32 expectations which funded Dr. Bettger at PENN. Dr. Naylor has the highest praise for Janet Bettger. She says Dr. Bettger writes very well and has the theoretical and empirical knowledge necessary to integrate rehabilitation concepts into a number of specialties, particularly neurological research. She believes her to be PI material and believes Dr. Bettger would be frustrated if not allowed to become both independent investigator as well as a collaborator. When asked what Dr. Bettger’s challenges are, she noted that -as with many exceptionally bright people- Dr. Bettger needs to focus on being tactful with her observations. She hastened to say that many exceptionally bright and creative people struggle with this very issue because they are capable of identifying key issues and implications very quickly. She observed that having a senior mentor can help with this issue. In closing, Dr. Naylor noted that she would hire Dr. Bettger if she could but the UPENN SON is focusing on senior nurse investigators for the three faculty lines currently open.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. White-Traut was Bell&apos;s dissertation chair and has worked with her since she was a student in the MSN program (10 years ago). Dr. Bell worked with her as a Researh Assistant while in the MSN program and then came back as a PhD student. One of her reasons for returning to the PhD program was to improve clinical practice and Dr. W-T describes Bell as very thoughtful about the kinds of clinical questions she has asked during her time in the program. Bell is highly motivated, meticulous about her scholarship and is an excellent writer and presenter. She has had a funded NRSA  and and is also an active participant in a research seminar. Dr. W-T believes she is very capable of teaching ABSN students but like any new faculty member will need mentoring. She highly recommends her for a position on our faculty.</ReferenceText>

Dr. Plassman noted that Bei successfully pursued collaborators in China and capyured her interest in China, as well. Her interest in aging and  global health is self motivated and she has a strong commitment to addressing issues of the elderly in China. She was described as one of the most motivated people she has ever met, and as one of her collaborators, she finds it hard sometimes to keep up. Dr. Plassman described their three NIH funded projects. She has another R-21 in China with another researcher. Bei, noted Plassman, has learned how to write grants very well, and to run grants effectively and efficiently. She noted that we can&apos;t go wrong if we are able to successful recruit Bei. She felt she was a joy to work with and thought that would be the same with colleagues at Duke.  When asked about her teaching, Dr. Plassman said she honestly had never seen her teach, but they had presented together many times and she was a good speaker.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Chi wrote a short reference as she was traveling in China. I have pated the entire note below:
Thank you for inviting me to give my opinion on Dr. Bei Wu&apos;s research and scholarship.  I am currently travelling in China so I will only make a short recommendation for Dr. Wu through email.  
 
I have known Dr. Wu since 2004 and we have written a few papers together.  Dr. Wu has impressed me as a serious scholar with strong research abilities.  She is a very diligent and produces excellent research outputs.  Since your search committee members have already reviewed her scholar achievement, I do not want to repeat them.  I just want to comment on her involvement in developing Chinese research network in US and China in recent years.
 
Dr. Wu indicated to me her interest in researching in China when we first met.  Subsequently, I have invited her to co-convene the informal interest group at GSA since 2006.  Our interest group will be co-hosting a meeting in Beijing in mid-July and Dr. Wu has been very active in assisting to plan this meeting.  I also invited her to participate in our recent conference on intergenerational support of older adults in China at USC.  She presented her cross-national study in the conference and facilitated with the group discussion.  In a nutshell, Dr. Wu has keen interest in studying older adults in China and she has built a wide network both here and in China.  
 
Although my letter is short, I have no doubt on Dr. Wu&apos;s scholarship and I strongly support her application to the position at your School.  Please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me if you need more information.

Iris Chi</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Crout has been the Associate Dean of Research in the School of Dentistry for 30 years. He describes Bei Wu as the most productive investigator he has ever worked with; she is  a &quot;tireless, passionate investigator who is willing to go the extra mile and to share with others.&quot; She was the top researcher at the University of West Virginia Health Science Center and mentored a number of faculty in Denistry. Drs. Crout and Wu have three current NIH grants together. He worked with her to provide dental input on research on Oral Disease and Cognitive Functioning. She recently received a  2.8 million dollars  R03 with China. She is described as a phenomenal epidemiologist, member of a NIH Review Panel on health disparities, and well accepted by peers. Her greatest expertise according to Dr. Crout is her ability to write successful grants. Parenthetically, he said we would &quot;short change ourselves if we had her in the classroom two days per week&quot; because her value is in research and developing grants. He was quick to add that this should not be interpreted to mean she is not a good teacher. He sees her as extremely collaborative and very open to including junior and senior researchers in her work. She is a passionate researcher and a great addition to any university. She is able to multi-task; working on 3 separate grants and 4 manuscripts at the same time.  &quot;She is also a fun person; great to be with.&quot;

Dr. Crout was sorry to see her leave West Virginia, but she did consent to stay on as a consulting faculty . For the current grants where they collaborate, she contributes a small percentage of time weekly.. They usually have a conference call once a week. When asked if he thought she would eagerly embrace the work on aging in the Caribbean. He said she is the type of person who is willing to work in multiple settings and interested in a variety of settings.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Ms. Kowalczyh has worked with Dr. Nash for the past 5 years in the clinic and in the classroom. They co-taught a primary care course together and then did guest lectures in a global health course for undergraduate students. She reports that Dr. Nash is comfortable in the classroom and has a nice pace to her lectures. Oftentimes she uses mini-pretest to introduce new content and she has a nice way of drawing students out that encourages student participation. She brings examples from her current practice to the classroom and is capable of managing large classes (usually 60-70 students). Whitney is approachable and comfortable dealing with difficult student situations. She is a role model and understands the business aspects of running a clinic. She pulls examples from her global health experience into classroom lecture. Her current contract with the school is 50% clinical, 50% teaching and as such does not require service to the school. However, she has done special projects to include working to have med students rotate through her clinic at the race track. Yes I would hire her.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Turley worked with the candidate as a doctoral student and continues to interact with him since then.  He describes Dr. E as &quot;one of the best students I&apos;ve ever seen in my life.&quot;  He has many unique abilities but one that stands out is his ability to listen to a discussion and come up with a visualization of the ideas and complexities of it …he creates a visual, &quot;ruminates&quot; over it, refines it, and comes up with a visual that shows complex interrelations, etc.  He is an excellent writer and &quot;a better editor&quot; .. He is able to get at what others are trying to say and help them say it effectively.  Dr. E is incredibly hard working and will take whatever time it takes to get something done, but he will get it done on time.  He is a great peer mentor and can easily transfer those skills to a faculty role.  He is very collegial, has &quot;stunning insight&quot; into problems and can truly understand them, and is a great speaker.  He can work independently, but in a way, that&apos;s a waste of his talent because he&apos;s so good at bringing people together and having him as part of a team takes full advantage of that skill.  Dr. E has good technical skills, maintains his connections with his &quot;home base&quot; in Mexico, and is definitely an emerging leader in Informatics … someone who will be leading the profession one day.  According to Dr. Turley, &quot;If you are lucky enough to get him, you&apos;ll have a great person in your midst.&quot;  Dr. Turley expressed no reservations whatsoever.</ReferenceText>

Although Dr. Sittig joined the faculty after Dr. E graduated, he says that all the faculty there speak very highly of Dr. E and he is one of the favorite students of all the faculty.  Among the strengths of Dr. E are the following:  (a)  helpful, outgoing, and the kind of person others like to be around … (b) generates lots of great ideas (especially about how to use technology in education) with one idea followed quickly by others … (c) a good writer and researcher … (d) a good teacher and thesis mentor … (e)  persuasive, dedicated, and innovative (e.g., he &quot;pushed the idea&quot; for and then set up systems at U Texas to help faculty use iPod and iTunes to support student learning … (f) pushes to explore the theoretical basis for why we do what we do in Informatics (a field where there is a limited theoretical base) and creates models to help identify the theoretical underpinnings of the practice.  Dr. Sittig was well aware of Dr. E&apos;s continued involvement with Dr. Turley and his doctoral students and noted the leadership and teaching abilities of Dr. E in those group meetings.  Dr. E continues to work hard with his &quot;home&quot; university in Mexico, pushing that institution to integrate Informatics there.  He is definitely seen as someone who will be a leader in the field.  Finally, Dr. Sittig commented that Dr. E has no green card but is working on it; additionally, he has applied for a visa for &quot;exceptional people&quot; and expects to get that soon.  Overall, the comments about the candidate were extremely positive and encouraging.</ReferenceText>

While in maryland, they were peers, Distler was director of FNP program while Vasquez was director of the PNP program.  Vasquez had extremely positive remards about distler.  Hard working, gets along, students love him, know a great deal about adult learning and knows how to take leadership of a project and yet can blend in an be a team member.  He gave some honest short comings for Distler stating that he needs to be more clear about his career trajectory - howere Distler was clear with me stating he would probably teach for another 10-15 years and would like to retire at a top school (i.e. Duke).  Vasquez stated that Distler has a great deal of experience in online education and is passionate about Adult learning.  Has tried to recruit Dr Distler to University of Miami as well as El Paso however Distler and family did not want to relocate that far south.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>In speaking with Dr Ambrosia, I got a sense that Dr Distler would be a good fit for our program.  He had the usual positive things to say about a reference: team player, leader, excellent teacher.  He believes Dr Distler would fit in well and would be successful at a research intensive university such as Duke.  He has demonstrated success while acting as FNP program chair at University of Maryland.  Ambrosia and Distler were colleagues while at Univ. of Maryland.  Feels Dr Distler&apos;s weaknesses were essentially minimal in comparison to his strengths that he could contribute to this school.  Believes Distler has excellent leadership ability as well as ability to be a team player.  His experience with family practice, online learning and adult learning would be a benefit.  Dr Ambrosia is currently a professor at University of Miami.</ReferenceText>

Dr. Wallace described Ms. Lekan as a very bright, hardworking doctoral student whose dissertation has been slower to materialize than expected.  The delay in Ms. Lekan’s dissertation has been primarily because of the many opportunities for other scholarship as well as her work obligations.   When asked about a realistic time frame for Ms. Lekan’s graduation, Dr. Wallace stated that she felt that Ms. Lekan would finish between May and August of 2011.  Dr. Wallace believes that the dissertation is now Ms. Lekan’s priority and therefore Dr. Wallace is confident that she will work diligently to finish within that timeframe.  Dr. Wallace has not had the opportunity to observe Ms. Lekan’s teaching, but given her poise and confidence when presenting in her doctoral work and expertise in cardiovascular, health disparities, and geriatrics she feels she would do an excellent job.  Dr. Wallace recommends Ms. Lekan for a faculty position without reservation.</ReferenceText>

Negative comments that she had include a lack of experience and knowledge of the full scope of the faculty role.  Mentions that he will certainly need mentoring to learn the additional work faculty do aside from teaching students.  She has also mentioned that he sometimes gets overextended with his commitments and then does not fully invest in the non-clinical work he is involved with (i.e. committee work, meetings, etc).</ReferenceText>

Worked with him while he was a resident and Dr Blessing was a staff nurse.  Has seen Bob grow into a very seasoned, competent, and well respected advanced practice clinician.  States that Dr Blessing is a solid clinical educator.  Demonstrates great attention to detail.  Has witnessed his expertise in teaching staff nurses, residents, and NP students.  Believes he would make a very easy transition to being faculty at school of nursing and splitting his time between DUSON and DUHS.  States Bob has done a fantastic job developing and growing the acute care role at DUHS in neuro ICU.  Believes he would be an asset at DUSON.  Downside that he mentions is that Dr Blessing may be spead a little too thin at times because he wants to have a hand in clinical practice, education and research.

He reported that she has taught some Stats classes and is rated very highly as a teacher.  She is &quot;the kind of person you want … someone who knows State, who can work effectively with PIs on projects, who communicates well in order to keep all team members on the same page and keep the train moving.&quot;  She is not a theoretical statistician but is excellent at helping researchers find statistical approaches that will help them answer the questions they have raised.  She works will with the research team and is always a valued player on it.  Dr. Landerman &quot;could not think of anyone to recommend more.&quot;</ReferenceText>

Although she was Mustillo&apos;s supervisor, they developed a collegial relationships, partly due to Mustillo&apos;s excellent contributions to the team and her personal style.  She ran &quot;lots of analyses,&quot; managed all the data, and wrote papers with Dr. Farmer.  She is a good collaborator who has high standards.  &quot;It&apos;s not about her but about what it all means.&quot;  Mustillo is masterful at sitting with others to work out what to include in a grant application, how to strengthen the methodology, and how to approach data analysis.  Her background in Sociology helps her focus not only on formulas but on how things link together.  She is good at discussing the conceptual base of a study and spends time getting into the substance of what she is studying in order to understand the field and how others have dealt with it.  Although Dr. Farmer has not seen Mustillo teach, she does say she takes teaching seriously and always wants to do the best she can to help students learn.  In essence, Dr. Farmer described Mustillo as &quot;wonderful&quot; … a &quot;great collaborator on how to structure data.&quot;</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. Owens has known Mustillo only for 3-4 years while they were both at Purdue, but he thinks very highly of her.  He was on the search committee when Mustillo was interviewed for a &quot;strategic&quot; position (one of 100 or so that were created to advance specific agendas of the university) that was to be part of a Stats cluster to advise faculty across the university.  She was &quot;up against other very good candidates&quot; and was selected because of her background and expertise (she is well-trained and has studied under a top notch mentor).  (Sadly, the vision of these &quot;strategic&quot; positions never materialized, and Mustillo has been called on to do more and more &quot;mundane&quot; things that do not necessarily tap into her talents.)  Dr. Owens has worked with Mustillo on 3 projects, one of which involved very complex statistics, and she did a superb job with developing the model, explaining it to those with limited Stats expertise, and managing all the data.  They have worked on papers together, and she is great to work with; she also has been the Stats person on some major grants, out of which have come superb publications in prestigious journals.  She puts time in to figure out Stats &quot;puzzles&quot;, gets along well with members of the team, and is approachable.  Finally, she has been teaching graduate Stats at Purdue and &quot;gets high evaluations.&quot;  Dr. Owens recommends Mustillo without reservation.</ReferenceText>

However, she does have good publications and is &quot;fantastic&quot; on a team (comes well-prepared, takes responsibility for tasks, follows through, and works very hard to help the team succeed).  She came to Dr. Mishel as a new doctorate but is highly capable as a researcher.  When asked about any concerns, she said she had none really.  When asked about her &quot;demonstrated leadership of EBP and implementation science initiatives,&quot; Dr. Mishel said she could not comment on that.

<ReferenceText>   Match with position &amp; research:  Good match with EBP and IS.  For example the RWJ grant which is a translational project in which she has taken the evidence about pressure ulcer management and is implementing it in nursing homes.  In this research, she determined that culture was a barrier and has obtained two grants to first develop a measure of nursing culture and then test it.  She uses the diffusion of innovation model in her work.  The next step is an R01.  Dr. Kennerly believes she has very high potential for research.
   Teaching:  As a new faculty member Dr. Yap was given a large statistics course to teach and is now seeking ways to improve her teaching.  Dr. Kennerly attributed teaching issues to the topic which “nursing students hate.  Dr. Yap sought assistance to improve teaching and is taking faculty development courses at the University on course redesign.  
   Other Strengths:  She is one of the best thinkers that Dr. Kennerly knows.  Says it is one thing to be intelligent and another to be able to think analytically.  Excellent writer.  Best person Dr. Kennerly knows at bringing together a productive research team.  Good collaborator.  
   What would have Dr. Yap improve if you could?:  She is still learning organizational/administrative skills such as managing a lot of paper—finding things etc.   She is also shy—does not appear so in small groups but is shy if giving a presentation to a large group.</ReferenceText>

He is always on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; in his work and does not just do &quot;the safe steps&quot;.  He is very generous with his partnerships with students and faculty alike.  He knows how to interface with industry in developing and moving ideas to market.  He would be a good SBIR writer.  The only shortcoming she could come up with was his speed at which he tries to get ideas published.  &quot;He writes too fast and hard to get ideas out.&quot;  &quot;He could be a little more polished, he just wants to get his ideas out.&quot;</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>I spoke with Dr Mary Haack this morning from University of Maryland School of Nursing regarding Dr. Alemi.She had nothing but very positive things to say about Dr Alemi.  She has worked with him over the past 10 years on a variety of projects.  Although he is not a clinician, he fully understands the clinical applications and translation of his work and research.  She was extremely complimentary of his work in personalized medicine and said he needs to be in a place like Duke where he will have the opportunity to work with people who do work in genomics and personalized health care.  She states that he is a very innovative and forward thinking scholar.  He is a high producer and a prolific writer.  She describes Dr. Alemi as very generous with his time and intellect.  She goes on to say that the people who work with him note he pushes his view point, but only to push scholarly discussion of a particular project or topic.  He is able to negotiate and compromise very well when working on a team.  The only negative/ short coming that she could come up with when pushed for one is that &quot;he is so smart and doesn’t understand where others are coming from sometimes&quot; , &quot;He is so forward thinking sometimes expects people to jump into the middle of projects with him and not lay the background for collaborators.  That can be intimidating to some who want to move forward slowly.&quot;  Overall, a very positive reference.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>I had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Peggy Maddox this morning regarding Dr Alemi.  She gave him a glowing reference.  She started by saying &quot;I wish I had a position to offer him, he would be a big gain for Duke&quot;.  She knew him as department chair and acting Dean - states he is an outstanding colleague who embraces the academic mission and big picture leadership but also fully thrives with academic freedom.  He is described as a self taught informaticist coming from an engineering background.  He is an operations researcher who does interdisciplinary research very well.  &quot;He is a pioneer in broad delivery of educational content on the web.  He expanded his informatics background into programming early in career to deliver the educational content.&quot;  He is described as easy to work with, is a true innovator and great thinker and values the contributions of other disciplines.  The only shortcoming she would give is that he is a results oriented person - early in his academic career he was more focused on the results and output and was frustrated with the slow progress and extended discourse of settings.  She stated he has grown over the years and has come to engage fully in the scholarly give and take.  Dr Maddox finished our conversation saying that Dr Alemi would be a very good fit for our organization not only within informatics but also with genomics, personalized health care and many other other ways.</ReferenceText>

*******************************************************
I have known Mr. Shankar Viswanathan from 1994 till date. He joined as a post graduate student in the department of Biostatistics at the Christian Medical College, Vellore India. The Chairman of the department pointed Mr Viswanathan out to me as a bright student with exposure to health related statistics for two years from 1992 at the Community Health Program at Pachod, run by Dr. Ashok Dayal Chand, one of the senior alumni of the Christian Medical College. 

During my interactions with Mr. Viswanathan since then, I have found him to have gained a good insight into medical problems and reasoning, as well as having developed a great ability to work with diverse groups of researchers in medicine from obstetricians, virologists, nephrologists, pharmacologists, surgeons and nurses. Mr. Viswanathan was a statistical advisor for the MSc nursing trainees.

I have had a fruitful collaboration with Mr. Viswanathan in Renal medicine that resulted in 9 publications in journals with high impact. He has assisted in countless smaller projects including some which has brought in small grants from the institution. 

I still continue to seek his wise counsel regarding statistical insights, the latest has been one on vaccination against H1N1 influenza viruses in the transplant population that I currently work with in Australia and hope to continue working with him on missing data in the transplant data that I am currently studying. I have tried unsuccessfully to entice him to work in Australia as he prefers working in the USA. Mr. Viswanathan is best used in an environment that he understands in depth, line and length and not with just the requirements of a particular study with its silo of information.  

I realize he has worked with injury prevention groups and has submitted a thesis on newer techniques with missing data, a bug bear of all research. 
He is meticulous to a fault and a gentleman to the core, loves a good game of shuttle badminton and a lovely evening of classical arts. 
I believe Mr. Shankar Viswanathan is the best and among the statisticians who have interphased and collaborated with the division of renal medicine in my career of 25 years and he would enrich the setting he lives and works in.

<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Marshall is on Mr. V’s dissertation committee.  He also has worked with him on projects through the Biostats core group in the injury prevention research center; Dr. Marshall was in a supervisory role on those projects.  Finally, they have done some guest lecturing and workshops together.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
As you would expect, Mr. V has a good understanding of advanced and complex statistical methods.  More importantly, however, he is a good communicator … able to clearly explain the Stats, etc.  He also is easy to work with, respects deadlines, and is a good team contributor who helps move things ahead.  Mr. V is able to engage with the team in an intellectual way, getting at the substance of the topic at hand, and is not afraid to go outside mere statistical methods in what he contributes.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Like any new PhD, the main areas that will need improvement are those related to his logical career growth … refinement of grant-writing skills, mentoring to obtain independent funding, support in the teaching role, etc.  There are no major weaknesses or anything that is outside what one would expect.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Mr. V is good at juggling multiple demands, fulfills responsibilities, respects deadlines (e.g., for grants), and follows through.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
He is very much a team player who works well with others and who becomes very engaged in the projects in which he is involved.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Mr. V is good at working with “Math-phobic” students.  His passion for data and working with statistical methods comes through to students, and that helps them learn.  Though he initially had a tendency to focus on the “algebra,” he quickly learned to “get to the heart of the matter” and use realistic examples that would have meaning for applied clinicians.  He is respectful of authority figures, but is very “Americanized” at this point and is not overly deferential to them.  He engages with others in a collegial way.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  … DEPENDABILITY … ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY … ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ..ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY ...QUALITY OF WORK
As noted earlier, he follows through on projects and always delivers.  He is dependable, and able to both follow direction and work independently.  He has worked in a “consulting environment,” where (as we know), it’s easy to get overcommitted when one is in a “service” position (i.e., helping others on their projects), so he is somewhat aware of the need to keep a balance, but this is something that develops with time and experience.  He may also need mentoring regarding dealing with “demanding” individuals who think their project is more important than someone else’s.  However, Mr. V is well aware of the need for being “demanding” when grant deadlines are operating.  Dr. Marshall expressed no real concerns about any of these qualities.

<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Cai is the chair of Mr. V’s dissertation committee and has been impressed with the work he did to develop statistical methods to analyze recurrent data (e.g., repeat asthma attacks) when data are missing.  She has worked with him for 4 years, and during this last year, Mr. V was her RA, helping with several research projects.  He helped prepare the Stats section and do some sample size calculations for some CTSA grants.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Mr. V has experience with collaborative/applied research and enjoys collaborative projects.  He is particularly interested in the “applied side” of Stats.  He has taught basic Stats before and is a good teacher.  And he has experience helping write and implement grants.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
There really are no weaknesses to be concerned about, but if one area needing improvement has to be identified, it would be that Mr. V needs to keep up with his expertise in methods.  While he is interested in methods and is current in that area from his PhD program, he much prefers the “applied side” of Stats and may have a tendency to focus there, leaving the “methods side” go a bit.  He needs to maintain expertise in both areas.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Mr. V is organized, follows through, can be counted on, and meets deadlines.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
He communicates well, develops good relationships with other students and faculty, offers ideas to the team, is respectful, is friendly, and has a nice personality.  Dr. Cai said she enjoys working with him, and others do as well.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Mr. V has a very positive attitude and is willing to take on a variety of responsibilities.  Others know they can count on him to do the work, and to do it well.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  … DEPENDABILITY  … ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY … ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS … ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY … QUALITY OF WORK
He is highly dependable, happy to take on responsibility, and good at following instruction but does not do so blindly.  He questions appropriately.  He also is able to work independently and has demonstrated this by doing independent searches of the literature when given an assignment or presented with a problem, offering alternative ways to approach a problem, etc.  He is thorough, but sometimes can be “too thorough” and need guidance on when to stop and set some limits.  Finally, the quality of his work is always at a high level.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?

A.	Nature of relationship between reference and candidate
First met Paula in the community when she arrived in Wilmington as she attended similar community meetings.  In 2008 Ms. Conner got to know Dr. Reid in a community HIV women of color open forum conference.  Dr. Reid was suggested as a facilitator for the panel of HIV+ women.  Dr. Reid has participated in that conference every year since and will be participating in the Spring 2011 conference.  Ms. Connor is very impressed with Dr. Reid&apos;s ability to connect with people.  For example all participants in the panel said “Dr. Reid makes you feel like you are the only person in the room when she speaks to you.  Ms. Conner stated this was true whether there were 2 or 200 individuals in the room.
	Co-facilitator of the women’s support group in Wilmington.
B.	Describe candidate’s strengths related to position description 
Paula’s work and conversation with others appeals to a wide variety of people.  She is a wonderful people person.  Dr. Reid appears to able to both teach and conduct research in a very positive way.  &quot;You know some people can do one or the other, but not both&quot;

C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement)

Very dependable, and always provides quality work.

E.	Describe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate)
Awesome to work with, &quot;You know there are people that we come across in our professional life that have been engaged in their work for a while and you see mediocrity.   Dr. Reid is not one of those individuals&quot;.  She is always striving to be better and make sure that content is appropriate.

F.	Describe candidate’s attitude/relationships with a) students, b) colleagues  c) administrators
Healthy relationships with everyone she meets and Ms. Conner would expect that Dr. Reid would be the same with students.  She has a good mix of setting boundaries, but also being very positive with people.

G.	Comments on candidate’s
a.	Dependability- very dependable follows through without any follow up.  When she says she will do something it is done.  Phone calls and emails are returned promptly.

<ReferenceText>I spoke with LT Colonel Rich Prior, Assistant Professor from Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS) this morning regarding Dr. Pamela Slaven-Lee.  As expected he had very positive comments.  He worked with Dr. Slaven-Lee for 2 years at USUHS working together to develop and teach primary care courses.  He describes her as a very well liked professional with a diverse skill set.  She is noted to be a very good lecturer who has grown into an effective faculty member who is not afraid to be a team player and step up to the plate for a challenge.  She had limited committee responsibilities however she did work effectively on the CCNE accreditation committee for their FNP program.  The students loved her and would describe her as tough but fair and approachable.  She wants to do the best she can to help her students succeed as competent clinicians.  She is very organized in her personal work as well as in what she delivers in the classroom.  She is clinically adept but is articulate when speaking about research and scholarship.  The only point for improvement that he mentioned was that she need to carve out structured time during her work week for scholarly work.  He was very sad to see her leave USUHS due to her husbands transer and she was a valuable faculty with a lot of potential and she will be missed.</ReferenceText>

<DateOfCheck>2011-01-12T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Ackerman is Jina’s dissertation and academic advisor at the University of Michigan.  He was not in this role during her first year of PhD work, but he has been in this role for 4 years or so.  Jina also has worked on an NSF-funded research project with Dr. Ackerman.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Dr. Ackerman described Jina as intellectually curious and someone who has “great taste in research and theoretical problems,” meaning she focuses on issues/questions of importance and significance.  She also has a real talent regarding creative ways to look at qualitative data.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  IDENTIFY AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Dr. Ackerman has never observed Jina teaching, so he is not able to comment on whether or not she would need guidance/support in that area of responsibility.  He also pointed out that she does not know the nursing field and would need to learn more about that so she could be most effective in teaching students and working with colleagues on projects or research teams.  And, as is true when anyone moves to a new place, she would need support to establish connections that would engage her in collaborative work.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Jina can function quite independently, and she gets the work done in a timely and efficacious way.  When you hand her a problem, she comes back to you with a solution/proposal or with good questions.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Jina has a wonderful ability to develop positive relationships with fellow students, faculty, and members of the research team.  She responds to constructive criticism, and she has been great at “anchoring” the research group and her doctoral student colleagues, meaning she helps the group stay focused and moving forward in productive ways.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY … ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY … ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS … ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY … QUALITY OF WORK
There are no concerns in any of these areas.  She can work independently but is also good at following directions.  The quality of her work is always of high caliber, and she is willing to take on responsibility and can be counted on to fulfill that responsibility.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
Jina will be finishing her PhD program this summer.  She is actually doing 2 studies, which is not uncommon in this department.  She is finished with one study and is in the middle of the second.  Dr. Ackerman has no doubt she will successfully complete the program this summer.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Dr. Ackerman wanted us to appreciate two things.  First, Jina’s thesis is a very challenging one, particularly regarding qualitative data analysis.  She has taken on that challenge in a very positive way and dedicated herself to learn social science methods, which required a change in thinking and conceptualization from what she had been accustomed to with her design background.  Second, Jina has published results of the study she has completed in conference proceedings, which is a significant accomplishment.  Conference proceedings are heavily refereed and they regularly move on to journal publication.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Pollack was the dean of the School of Information until last summer and during that time (for 1.5-2 years), Jina worked with her as an RA on some research projects while she was working on her dissertation.  The research projects related to patient scheduling in clinics, and the teams were interdisciplinary one.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Jina knows what it takes to “walk the walk,” not just “talk the talk” regarding interdisciplinary collaboration and research.  She appreciates that questions of informatics cut across disciplinary lines and is respectful of that.  She listens carefully to and respects different perspectives, but she can also relate her perspective to the team most effectively.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT 
LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Dr. Pollack has not seen Jina “in action” with nursing students, so she cannot speak to that, but she has seen Jina in interaction with clinicians and has no doubt that Jina can do well with teaching.  Her biggest challenge will be to make the transition from the role of student to that of faculty member, so guidance and support from colleagues who can help her bolster her confidence to 100% that “I can do this as an independent scholar.”  Dr. Pollack indicates that she thought this was something that all new PhDs need to work on and have help with.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Jina is great!  She would take a project or task or assignment and “run with it.”  She seeks guidance and help appropriately, but she can easily pick things up and make continued progress.  She also can work independently and be counted on to fulfill her responsibilities without question.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Dr. Pollack noted that she was particularly impressed with how Jina worked with computer scientists on the research project to try to truly understand the “back end” elements of what they were doing, even though that is not her area of expertise or even real interest.  She was impressive regarding her ability to interview clinicians as part of the study.  Everyone who works with her, respects Jina and enjoys working with her.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Dr. Pollack had no comments other than those already noted above.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
There is no question that Jina is highly dependable, able to follow direction, but also able to work independently.  She will speak up and not “cave in” if she has an important perspective to share.  The quality of her work is excellent.  Dr. Pollack said she has no concerns in these kinds of areas.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
Jina plans to complete her dissertation this summer and is on track to do that.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Dr. Pollack said that Jina truly understands how information and information systems are to human enterprises and communities, and this is something she sees as a real strength in a scholar and teacher.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Newman first met Jina in 2007 when he joined the faculty at Michigan.  They collaborated to develop a writers group where students and faculty bring proposals, papers, etc. for comment/feedback/discussion.  For one year, he and Jina worked together on a research project that relates to her dissertation, namely, helping patients get information and support regarding complex health problems.  Finally, he is on her dissertation committee, and they are finishing a paper to submit for publication in the proceedings of the CHI Conference, which is the premier/gold-standard conference related to computer/human interaction.  

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Jina is excellent regarding communications, as evidenced by her contributions to the writers group.  She is very interested in health care and the use of computers/ informatics related to patient care, support systems, etc.  She has the talent and the drive to build and sustain a high quality research program.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Dr. Newman has not seen Jina teaching and thinks she will need some support there; but he has seen her ability in encouraging other (more junior) students, giving them feedback that is constructive and respectful, and so on … so he is confident she will do well as a teacher.  His concern about her is a common one … something with which many of us struggle … and that is staying focused despite being interested in many topics and problems.  She has had to do that with her dissertation and has been  successful, but she would benefit (as is true for many new faculty) from mentoring related to achieving that balance of broad interest and razor-sharp focus.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
From his experiences working with Jina on her dissertation, on his research project, and in the writers group, Dr. Newman says that Jina is most effective in doing her job.  She is insightful, attentive, pulls ideas together in thoughtful ways, and is thorough (e.g., she carefully read through and did a grounded theory analysis of more than 4,000 e-mails from patients about their experiences with complex health problems).

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
She is delightful.  She is respectful, constructive, follows through, and is a team player.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Jina is one of the leaders among the doctoral students.  Other students go to her for advice and feedback, and the way she interacts with them is positive and helpful.  As a member of his research project team, Dr. Newman indicated she always had a positive influence on the group.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
Jina is very organized, disciplined, highly dependable, and a great colleague.  She anticipates things and plans for them.  She shows leadership, and the quality of her work is always of the highest caliber.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
She is on track to graduate from the PhD program this summer.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Dr. Newman noted that in this field (because technology and computer use moves so rapidly), conference presentations and publications in conference proceedings are viewed as more prestigious than publications (which often take quite a lot of time to get out to others), so Jina’s achievements in this area are commendable.  As a side note … he was incredibly enthusiastic about this candidate and could not say enough good things about her.</ReferenceText>

<DateOfCheck>2011-02-18T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Yucha met Jennifer in 2000 when she was an undergraduate student.  She did a “research experience” with Dr. Yucha at that time and really got “hooked” on research.  After that, Jennifer did the MSN/PhD program, and Dr. Yucha was her dissertation advisor.  Since finishing the PhD 6 years ago (or so), they stay connected by phone a few times/year, with Jennifer calling her to discuss her work, professional issues, etc.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Jennifer is extremely well organized, quick to learn new things, works very efficiently (which allows her to get much done in a short period of time and be quite productive), and focused on her research and her professional work.  She has exquisite research skills, and her youth allows her to have a solid research career and to “make a real difference.”

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Jennifer is a perfectionist, which can be a real asset in some ways, but a “weakness” in other ways.  She also is very bright, and the two characteristics combine to sometimes make her impatient with those who don’t follow through, who are willing to accept mediocrity, or who are not as competent as she is.  She never, however, “flaunts” her talents.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
As an undergraduate research “assistant” and as a doctoral student, Jennifer required very little direction.  If she needed something, she would go to others on campus to get it or learn what she needed to learn.  She is self-directed and needs little (if any) prompting.  She always did what was expected of her and “delivered.”

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Jennifer is collaborative, helps others appropriately, and “steps up” to take a leadership role in a group when leadership is needed.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Jennifer established mutually respectful relationships with colleagues and fellow students, and she recognizes and values what others bring to the team.  Some might perceive her as threatening because she is so bright and always so well prepared, but if that were to happen, it’s more the “fault” of the perspective or assumptions of the person feeling “threatened” rather than by anything Jennifer actually does or says.  She is a warm, caring individual.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
There is no question that Jennifer is a “star” in each of these areas.  There has never been any question about her integrity, dependability, willingness to take on responsibility, or the quality of her work.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
The close relationship with Dr. Yucha ended when Jennifer completed her PhD, though they do still keep in touch “now and then.”  “I would hire her in a flash if I could, but she needs to be in a place like Duke … a place that will nurture, encourage, and support her passion for research.”

<DateOfCheck>2011-02-18T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Cohen has known Jennifer from when she first came to Duke, when the Center he directs supported her on a post-doc training grant.  She has been involved in some of the work at the Center, but Dr. Cohen’s relationship with Jennifer has been more secondary than direct.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Jennifer is extremely dedicated and goal oriented to do research as a career, something that has impressed Dr. Cohen immensely.  She is bright and has a good sense of what research entails.  She also is pursuing a very important line of work and has been able to achieve a “nice balanced view” of clinical issues and science, and maintain a balanced perspective that is most useful to her work and that of her colleagues.  Dr. Cohen noted that it’s been his experience that not many people are able to achieve such a balance.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Jennifer really has no weaknesses.  She is receptive to suggestions, follows through, and is to be admired for how she “stuck to her guns” when she was faced with some obstacles to moving forward with her research.  Dr. Cohen noted that Jennifer had a bit of a “slow start” with her research, but that was due to circumstances beyond her control, not any weaknesses on her part.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Jennifer always delivers quality work, needs little prompting, and gets done what she says she will do.  There has never been any question about her fulfilling responsibilities.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Jennifer has excellent interpersonal skills.  She is highly effective with communication, is easy to get along with, and is pleasant.  

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Dr. Cohen said that Dr. Krause will be able to speak more to Jennifer’s effectiveness on a research team than he is able to comment on, but he can say that his experience with Jennifer is that she is respectful of others and is an effective colleague.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
Jennifer is excellent in all of these areas.  She is more dedicated than many.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
Not applicable

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Dr. Cohen commented how impressed he was with Jennifer receiving the K award and noted that this award is a good testament to her capabilities and the importance of her work.  He commented that Jennifer serves as a “bridge” between many areas and types of science and various investigators and concluded by saying, “From what I know, she would be an excellent addition to the DUSON faculty.”

**  ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS/ISSUES/CONCERNS RAISED BY THE SEARCH COMMITTEE **
I noted that our review of Jennifer’s CV indicated somewhat sporadic achievements regarding publications and presentations.  He addressed that in the same way Jennifer had – that her experiences with losing a research mentor and losing data set her back and that the journals in which her work should be published have “raised the bar” in terms of their expectations.  He notes that the kind of work Jennifer does “takes time to do” and then a careful analysis and reporting also takes time.  She is, however, beginning to be more consistent with presentations and publications as her work continues to evolve.  He has no doubt she will be extremely productive as a scholar.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceName>Dr. Bill Kraus, Professor &amp; Director of Clinical	 Research, Center for Living, Duke University</ReferenceName>
<DateOfCheck>2011-02-24T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Kraus has been Jennifer’s mentor for the past few years.  When Jennifer first went to the Aging Center, she worked with another individual as a mentor.  That person left Duke and left behind a “rather disastrous situation” which significantly affected Jennifer and ended up putting her far behind in her work.  Dr. Kraus became her mentor at that point, and they have worked together on the genetics group and on research teams since then.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Dr. Kraus noted that someone in a research position needs to be able to ask pertinent questions, know the tools that are needed to help answer those questions, and be able to write up and present results in public.  He believes Jennifer has all of these abilities.  Additionally, her evolving area of expertise is unique and not being explored by anyone else.  This, he notes presents opportunities (e.g., having a “wide open” area to investigate) as well as challenges (e.g., finding resources and having to develop a vision of what needs to be done in the area).  Jennifer is great with seeking out resources and establishing networks/connections, so Dr. Krause has no doubt she would meet the challenges with great success.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
As noted by Dr. Kraus, the areas in need of improvement for Jennifer are what one would expect from someone at her career stage.  As someone relatively new to the field, she will need to continue to develop increasing independence as a researcher and as someone who can negotiate her own partnerships.  He also  noted Jennifer’s limited publication record to date and ascribed that to the “disaster” of her first year in the Center.  He did say, however, that she has presented at national meetings in a most successful way, and she will have two seminal publications very shortly.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Jennifer is a very responsible individual who can be counted on to fulfill her commitments and do that in a timely way.  She has been able to balance many competing demands but will need continued mentoring to be able to continue to do that.  There is no question about her effectiveness in doing what is expected of her … and more.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Dr. Kraus said that Jennifer is an excellent member of the research team … making significant contributions, asking important questions, offering helpful perspectives, and so on.  “There are no red flags” in this area.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Dr. Kraus could not speak to Jennifer’s relationship with administrators or students, but she is a most effective colleague.  She is easy to work with, can be counted on to do her part, and helps others think through ideas that will allow them to pursue their own line of investigation.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
All of these qualities are strengths of Jennifer.  Dr. Kraus noted no concerns or issues.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
Her work in the Center is ending, and she is looking to move into new roles.  He would love to have her continue to work with him and his team.

<ReferenceName>Bruce Barrett, MD, PhD</ReferenceName>
<DateOfCheck>2011-05-03T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>From email
“In the decade I&apos;ve been at U.W. I&apos;ve brought in a few reasonably large NIH grants to do several randomized trials and other research projects, always publishing results.  Roger is probably the very best colleague that I&apos;ve had, always willing to do the work needed and usually in less time than projected.  His grasp of research design, data analysis and high level statistics beats is clearly superior to the several other PhD tenure track statisticians that I&apos;ve worked with.  It would be a serious blow to lose him to Duke, but I&apos;ve have to be honest and say that his level of competence and collegiality is truly exceptional.”

Phone interview
Dr. Barrett called Dr. Brown &quot;leaps and bounds&quot; above other statisticians that he has worked with.  He is always ahead of others with new statistical methods and programs and has the citation sot relevant literature to support his approaches. He is always ahead of reviewers on manuscripts and at NIH and has to education them.  Dr. Barrett calls him a “career making for me.”  He was Dr. Barrett’s statistical mentor on a K award and the statistician on subsequent R01s.  He is good a team work with the large team of 20 or so investigators on Dr. Barrett’s studies.  Also sees Dr. Brown as an outstanding mentor meeting frequently with mentees and coaching them in statistics.  Dr. Barrett describes him as friendly, always on time with work and carries through.  Perceived weaknesses are that he prefers to do the thinking level work and not administration and sometimes may miss the forest for the trees because he is working at such a high level.  Another weakenss is that Dr. Barrett wonders if he could communicate the statistics to people that don&apos;t have much stats background.  
Note: Dr. Barrett called me unscheduled and I did not have the form out so I could not follow the list of quesitons.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Phone Reference

A.	Nature of relationship between reference and candidate:   
Dr. Reisch hired Dr. Brown when she was the Associate Dean for Research at Wisc.  Having a statistician on the faculty was a new idea for the school and thus Dr. Brown had to create the role.  He is now 100% funded on grants.

B.	Describe candidate’s strengths related to position description :   
Co-I on numerous projects.  He immediately drops everything to attend to statistical needs and grant deadlines.  He has a really passion for this statistical consultation role, is current on methods—always learning—and can explain new methods well.  He is well networked nationally.  He reviews manuscripts and has a good sense about how to frame critical arguments.  Really enjoys his work. 

C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement):  
Although he will drop everything to meet an immediately need, things that don’t have a pressing a deadline may get lost.  He is not teaching for them right now so she could not speak about teaching.

D.	Describe candidate’s effectiveness of performing job responsibilities.
See above.  Dr. Riesch does not want to loss Dr. Brown.  I asked Dr. Riesch if Dr. Brown would be able to help develop “junior” statisticians and she thought that he could.  He has never had the opportunity as he has been the only statistician at Wisc. School of Nursing.

E.	Describe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate):  
Interested in the faculty.  Easy to connect with for the faculty.  He responds best when the person he is consulting with takes the statistics seriously—even if they are not that knowledgeable.  

F.	Describe candidate’s attitude/relationships with others:  
Always polite and friendly.  Not a “queen bee.”  Doesn’t talk down to faculty that may not know statistics well.

G.	Why did candidate leave position in your organization; would you rehire/hire candidate?   
Wisconsin Governor is proposing changes for state employees that will greatly impact retirement benefits after July 1, 2011 and so many of the faculty are retiring early to retain their current benefits.  He falls in this group.</ReferenceText>

C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement):  
Dr. Koenig could not think of a negative.  After a few seconds of thinking he said, you just won’t  hear a negative from me.  I would love to have her as a colleague.  Her work would open up new avenues of investigation for us at the Duke Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health.

D.	Describe candidate’s effectiveness of performing job responsibilities:  
Responds well to negative events—she received a grant award from the Center but the transfer of money to UNC has been block by red tape and Dr. Hamilton has been gracious about it.  

E.	Describe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate):  
Outstand  She is highly skilled, responsible, enjoyable.

F.	Describe candidate’s attitude/relationships with others:  
See above

G.	Why did candidate leave position in your organization; would you rehire/hire candidate?   
Dr. Koenig believes that she wants to come to Duke (rather than leave UNC) because she has a group of collaborators at Duke who are interested in her research.</ReferenceText>

WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Several years ago, Rachel reached out to me because she wanted to collaborate on some projects and was looking for colleagues with whom to work.  We shared common interests regarding standards.  We worked out a research agenda together, published together, wrote grants together and are now co-editing a book on clinical research informatics.  She also partially funded me on some grants of hers.  All in all, she really helped me advance my own career through her inclusiveness and guidance.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Rachel has a broad understanding of the field and has a unique ability to lead in several different contexts.  She is effective in getting people with different perspectives “on the same page,” and can find a fit with individuals who have varying perspectives (e.g., clinicians, researchers, technicians).  She has worked with “big names” in Informatics and brings those “contacts” to her work and her insights.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
If I had to identify one area it would be that she has to be careful not to be too ambitious and take on too much.  She is able to prioritize and get things done, and she can focus … but she may need some guidance to not try to do everything at once, no matter how exciting it might sound.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
She is always on time with reports, projects, and even the small details.  Her reputation is solid and people respect her.  She is sensitive to what people think – in a positive way – and this helps move projects along.  She works well within a consortium, can multi-task, and seeks out different groups or individuals to collaborate.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
As already stated, she is collaborative, pleasant, not threatening, personable, and reaches out to others.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
She does not have a teaching assignment, but she has guest lectured and worked with GAs.  She seems to have a “natural ability” to teach, is patient, is good at guiding others, is open to others’ perspectives, and involves others (e.g., the GAs) in her work in appropriate and effective ways.  I am not aware of any difficulties she has had with colleagues or administrators.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
There are no concerns in this area.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
I’m only guessing here, but I believe Rachel is seeking an opportunity in a larger, more complex institution that offers more opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and has well-established programs in Informatics that are shaping the field.  I am not in any position to hire her, but if I did have that opportunity, I would certainly welcome her to my team.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
None.

<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
For approximately 8 years, I was the chair of the Health Care Sciences Department, which included the CRNA program.  Mary was a faculty member in my department.  She was appointed to the merit review committee in the department, and I worked with her in that capacity.  She teaches the Pharm course, and I teach with her a bit.  Finally, I’ve been a research mentor for her to some extent.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Mary is enthusiastic (particularly related to research), an excellent teacher (especially regarding Pharm), and a well-respected clinician.  She gets along with people, is not dogmatic, is always “out to learn,” and is always willing to do what needs to be done to resolve problems and continue to move forward.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
There are no major weaknesses.  If I were forced to identify something, I would say that on occasion, she “forgets this or that” – primarily because she is carrying so many roles in several different institutions – but this has been only in relation to small things … nothing large or significant.  And it may be that I’m more of a perfectionist than I should be, thereby making me even aware of this.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Mary develops good relationships with students from all disciplines in our department and is able to explain things clearly so that they truly understand concepts.  She sets high standards for students and takes initiative (e.g., she started a journal club with CRNA students).  She provides good feedback to students that helps them create worthy products/projects, and she is highly respected by others.  Mary also is well networked regarding clinical practice and uses those networks to her students’ advantage.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
She is enthusiastic, gets the job done, and learns quickly (e.g., how to write good test questions).  It’s a joy to work with her.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
Mary is collegial, collaborative, works well with students and faculty colleagues, and is a department chair’s “dream” because she’s the kind of person who plans carefully and then is the “legs” of a project, ensuring it’s done and done well.  She has invested a great deal of time to help students write their proposals, and they appreciate it.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
I have no issues or concerns here.  Her work is always of high quality, and she can work independently without becoming a “loose cannon” who goes off and “does her own thing.”

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
There have been many changes in leadership here at Wayne State, and things seem to be “bogged down” while the institution gets clear of its goals, including those related to research.  Mary has great potential for doing important research and wants to be in an institution where she can do that.  There also are financial problems in Michigan and while our department has been very successful in generating revenue, we often do not benefit from that, which can become quite frustrating after a while.  I think Mary wants to go to a place where her energies can be devoted to more productive things.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Mary has done all that we’ve asked of her … and more.  She is developing as a leader and pushes innovation.  She will need some mentoring if she were to apply for large NIH awards (e.g., RO-1 or R21).  We will miss her, as she has been a very valuable faculty member.</ReferenceText>

A.	Nature of relationship between reference and candidate
Has worked with candidate on collaborative projects and research at UCLA.  First met her while she was a post doc working in pain med development.

B.	Describe candidate’s strengths related to position description 
“you will be getting one of the best” with Dr Compton.  She is always focused and gets along well with colleagues.  “She is nearly the best collaborator I have worked with”  “She is good at what she does as an administrator and researcher”

C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement)
The reference did not answer this directly.  My best attempt at getting a solid answer from him was a story he gave about Dr Compton starting her research career and she would become frustrated if colleagues did not pull their weight or were not as focused as her – and now she has become “more mellow and well rounded”

D.	Describe candidate’s effectiveness of performing job  responsibilities 
According to this reference there is no question that this candidate is very effective in performing her job responsibilities.

E.	Describe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate)
“She is a very self-disciplined person”  “She is very good with her junior colleagues and her students”
The reference spoke a fair amount about Dr Compton being very likable, able to work well with others, is a creative problem solver, and is highly collegial.

F.	Describe candidate’s attitude/relationships with a) students, b) colleagues  c) administrators
Positive attitude and relationships with students, colleagues and administrators

G.	Comments on candidate’s
a.	Dependability – very dependable
b.	ability to take on responsibility – highly responsible
c.	take/follow instructions – good leader and team member
d.	ability to work independently – able to work independently
e.	quality of work - outstanding

H.	Why did candidate leave position in your organization; would you rehire/hire candidate?
“not sure of all of the reasons why she is leaving her position”  Mentioned her wanting to move back to the east coast.  “Los Angeles is a very expensive place to live, perhaps part of this is economic”</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>I have known Dr. Pan since 2001. I have worked with him in multiple roles. I was his non-discipline mentor and he has grown so much since we met.

He teaches several statistics &amp; research courses to masters and PHD students because of his expertise in both. I often invite him to co-chair or chair research committees. I capitalize on his expertise and have served as his Co-PI and co-authored several grants and publications with him.
He has a strong focus on the pedagogy for statistics.
His strength is his expertise in stats and his passion for students. He has a great ability to mentor and work with students and faculty.

He relieves student’s anxiety. Students often speak of his passion and say they see it in him.
I heard about it so much I decided to go to his class and observe him and I saw it for myself. 
 It is hard to think of an area of improvement as he is so good. If I had to say something it would be his assertiveness, because he can’t seem to say no to people.

He has a real collaborative personality and believes in collaborative work systems.

His service and service record is excellent. We serve on several professional committees together.
He works with a lot of nursing students especially in his meta-analysis class.
He is reliable and dependable and I can’t think of a better person to work with or around.
I don’t want his to leave. But I think he needs to be where his career can grow.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>Dr. David Rosenbaum is with Wake Emergency Physicians  

WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
I came here in April 2008 and worked with Meg as a colleague.  In November 2010, I took the position of chief MD for overseeing all NPs (N=3) and PAs (N=32), and now serve as Meg’s primary supervisory MD.  We do reviews together, and she consults with me on various patient situations.  I very much consider her a valuable colleague.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Meg has a wonderful personality.  She is enthusiastic and has a strong ability to meet people where they are, something that I think is essential for teaching.  She has excellent judgment and is a great clinician.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Although she has excellent judgment, Meg is a bit risk averse in her practice, something that may get in the way of being innovative as a teacher.  She “needs to stick to her gut more.”

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
I can always count on Meg to do a great job. I’m relaxed when working with her and know that there is no need to micro-manage what she does.  She comes to me appropriately for guidance on complex issues.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Meg is very personable, willing to be involved, and very much contributes to the success of our team.  She is “upbeat” and is someone we all can count on.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
I can’t speak to her relationships with students, but as noted, she is a delightful colleague and a responsible employee who makes good judgments.  Again, I’m very much at ease when working with her, and it seems that others are as well.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
There are absolutely no concerns here.  She is excellent in her work, dependable, and can function very independently … and enjoys that independence.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
We do a lot of education through our group here, and Meg really seems to “resonate” with that.  She has a real interest in education and knows that it helps her keep current.  Additionally, she has some family responsibilities that occasionally put pressures on her to attend to those needs and do her job, so a position with a bit more flexibility may be appealing to her as a way to manage those issues … this has not been any problem that interfered with her work, but I think it put pressure on her at times.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
I really like Meg and have enjoyed working with her.

<ReferenceText>REFERENCE CHECK FORM

A.	Nature of relationship between reference and candidate
Paula and I meet when she was working on her master at the university. I worked with her in the student teacher capacity. She worked on student committee and prominent in student affairs, we worked closely together. As a result I got to know her well so when she graduated with her masters she came to speak to me about research and research methods. She sought me out for insight. I supported her doctoral studies.
B.	Describe candidate’s strengths related to position description 
She in many ways is pretty seasoned as a teacher.  She has a strong foundation in research and a strong publication record. She is a nicely well-established scholar. She will need tenure process mentorship. However she brings a lot with her skill set and content knowledge. She has a lot to offer.
C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement). 
I don’t see any deficits in her skills set and abilities. She will need mentorship to navigate the
institutional environment.

D.	Describe candidate’s effectiveness of performing job responsibilities 
Exceptional!! She can stay the course, be focused not lose sit of the goal. No concern about her balancing. I think she will juggle research, teaching and service. He has time management skills.
E.	Describe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate)
She is a joy to work with. She has the right personality and temperament. She is not self-absorbed. She is vested in participating in the team.
F.	Describe candidate’s attitude/relationships with a) students, b) colleagues c) administrators
Ability to communicate and temperament are her greatest assets
She is incredibly respected in her community.

G.	Comments on candidate’s No concerns at all in this area!!!
I.	Dependability

II.	Ability to take on responsibility

III.	Take/follow instructions

IV.	Ability to work independently

V.	Quality of work

VI.	Why did candidate leave position in your organization; would you rehire/hire candidate?

It is difficult for someone in a clinical role to focus on a scholarly career and be a nurse educator in this environment. Being in a research intense institution will support her career trajectory. In Canada we are suffering for budgetary cuts and can’t offer faculty positions.

She brings nursing expertise, research expertise and her knowledge base is strong. She is a team payer energetic and can excite the people working with her

On her PhD work I was overwhelmed but I took her on because the dividends are huge and she will make a difference and this is what motivated to take her on.

Her work with pain is very important. I believe she will be an asset to the Duke community.</ReferenceText>

<ReferenceText>
Dr. Stevens is a Professor at the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing, University of Toronto … and the Signy Hildur Eaton Chair in Paediatric Nursing at The Hospital for Sick Children (in Toronto, I assume)

WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
I’ve known Paula for more than 10 years … first as a CNS in the pain program at our hospital, then as a PhD student (I was on her committee), and then working with her on papers.  I have also known Paula through another initiative … I am the co-PI on Canada’s strategic program related to pain, and Paula has been one of the trainees in that program; this was tied to her PhD work since the program is designed to build research capacity related to pain.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Paula knows where pain research in children is at.  She has done both qualitative and quantitative research and is comfortable with both methods.  She has a clear program of research.  Her strong nursing background is evident as she works effectively with interdisciplinary groups and when it comes to being able to look at the whole picture regarding pain management.  Her particular area of study is unique.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
Although she is quite capable, she is a novice researcher and will need to gain experience in writing and managing grants/funding and in generating outputs (i.e., papers, etc.).  She has great potential, and I have no doubt she will do all of this very well with some guidance and support

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
Paula is outstanding.  She is focused, organized, and does what she needs to do to get things done.  For example, she took time off work to complete her PhD because she was so committed to that goal.


DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Paula is very effective with communication, which is important when working with others.  She is energetic, has integrity, is personable, seeks and accepts constructive feedback well, and is good with problem-solving strategies.  She “attracts people to her.”

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
In addition to what’s already been said, Paula is flexible and willing to “go the extra mile” (e.g., to get a grant finished), but at the same time, has a good work/life balance.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
I have no concerns regarding any of these areas.  Paula definitely works hard when she needs to, but she won’t burn out because she can balance work and life.  I think that’s enormously healthy and helpful … and will allow her to be more productive in the long run.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
Paula completed her PhD and her involvement in the Canada-wide project.  If I had the funding, I would love to hire her.  She is a “catch.”

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
I think Paula is looking for a challenge and an opportunity to really get into research and to grow.  She will be adaptable in a new environment, based on the success she has had with doing clinical work in the Middle East and moving around.  She would be quite an asset to your school.

<ReferenceName>Dr. Kathy Knafl, UNC-Chapel Hill</ReferenceName>
<DateOfCheck>2012-05-01T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Knafl and Dr. Chesla have a shared interest in family research.  Since one’s focus is on children and the other on adults, they have not been on proposals together, nor have they worked together, but they know each other through their research.  They also collaborated to form a new organization, the International Family Nursing Association, and they are co-chairs to plan the 2013 conference for that association.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Dr. Knafl described Dr. Chesla as a premier researcher, having been the PI on at least 2 RO-1 grants and several non-NIH grants, and the co-PI on several other major studies. She can easily mentor PhD students and faculty regarding their research, and has received awards for mentorship.  She has served on large multidisciplinary research teams and is very skilled in working across disciplinary boundaries.  Her expertise in community based participatory research is well known, she is an excellent speaker (having heard her present at several professional conferences), and she is a “solid citizen of the discipline and the university.”

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
“Honestly, I cannot identify a single weakness in Dr. Chesla.”

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES  …  DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?)  …  DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS  …  PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S DEPENDABILITY, ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY, ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY, QUALITY OF WORK.
As the co-chair to plan the 2013 IFNA conference, Dr. Knafl notes that Dr. Chesla is extremely responsible.  She takes on tasks so the labor is divided, she always does what she says she will do, and she “raises her hand” to volunteer when work needs to be done.  Dr. Knafl has seen the candidate in role of group chair and group member and notes that she is comfortable and effective in both roles.  Dr. Knafl also noted that Dr. Chesla has willingly shared syllabi for several courses, in which the learning material is extremely well developed.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
When asked why she thought Dr. Chesla might be looking for a new position at this time, Dr. Knafl identified 2 factors she believes would “pull” her to DUSON and one factor that would “drive her to leave UCSF.”  The “pull” factors are a readiness for change and a “new adventure” and her high regard for Dean Gilliss.  The “push” factor is the resource poor California system.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Dr. Knafl noted that it would be great to have Dr. Chesla in this area.  She is passionate about her work and would be a “mover and a shaker” here.</ReferenceText>

<DateOfCheck>2012-05-04T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
Dr. Lee first came to know Dr. Chesla when they both were instructors at the University of Washington; however, since their clinical areas were different, the only “connection” they had was on a committee.  They both then started at UCSF at about the same time and although their specialties were different (Psych and OB), both had a family focus and were in the same department.  They have not taught together or been on the same research study, but they have collaborated as colleagues in the department.  Dr. Lee commented, in particular, that Dr. Chesla was the department chair when a very difficult situation presented itself, and she noted how Dr. Chesla handled that situation directly and fairly.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Dr. Lee noted that Dr. Chesla is a valued member of the department whose work has been a significant factor in continuing the qualitative research work for which the school has been known for many years.  She wrote one of the earliest articles on triangulation (today referred to as mixed methods) and challenged the research community to consider the meaning when quantitative and qualitative findings are incongruent.  She is “amazing in her research,” expert in running research teams, effective in mentoring PhD students and junior faculty in their scholarly work, and experienced on study sections.  She is an international leader in family nursing and co-founded the international nursing association for family nursing researchers.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
After much thought and some reluctance, Dr. Lee said that although Dr. Chesla has had just about every research experience imaginable, something comes along every now and then that she is not comfortable with.  In such situations, she seeks advice when not sure and is always eager to learn new things.  “This is not really a weakness – in fact, it really is a strength – but I’m just trying to convey that she is not expert in every dimension of research,” said Dr. Lee.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.
PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK.
Dr. Chesla is a mature faculty member who understands how the university works and the need to be involved in its work.  In fact, although she is constantly being asked to be a visiting scholar (and she does accept some of those invitations), she is “always here” and “her presence is obvious.”  She is engaging, delegates appropriately to project directors, and is most perceptive about people and their potential.  She is “not conflict-phobic” but will take on conflict and work collaboratively to resolve/manage it.  She has a reputation for being “tough” and has very high expectations of students, yet they all “flock to her” because they know they will learn so much from working with her.  She teaches both MSN and doctoral students and is a faculty member others will often go to for advice on how to deal with a student issue.  You can always count on her to follow through, do what is asked of her and more, do an excellent job, and create positive working relationships.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
When asked why she thought Dr. Chesla might be looking for a new position at this time, Dr. Lee said she believes she is at a point in her career where she is ready for a new challenge.  She has been at UCSF for a long time and is reflecting on “What’s the next phase for me?”  She knows Dean Gilliss, holds her in high regard, has worked/collaborated effectively with her at UCSF, and appreciates her leadership style.  “Kit would not go just anywhere … it has to be a mutually agreeable fit for her, and at this point in her exploration of Duke, I’m sure she has carefully evaluated that ‘fit’ and found that it could be a very good one.”

<DateOfCheck>2012-06-11T00:00:00</DateOfCheck>
<ReferenceText>Dr. Rhem is an Associate Professor in the School of Nursing/Department of Family at UCSF

WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE CANDIDATE?
I first met Kit when I was doing a post-doc (with someone else) at UCSF in 1996.  I then left to take a faculty position elsewhere and in 2003 came on the faculty at UCSF.  Kit was my assigned mentor, and she has remained a colleague and mentor since then.  We have taught the Intro to Qualitative Research course together, she has been a guest speaker in other courses I’ve taught, we are in the same department, and she is the co-PI on my R-01 grant.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?
Kit is quite expert in her field, has great national and international influence as a scholar, and “knows how things work” in the research world (having been extensively funded herself and served on study panels).  She helped me and others be successful with grant writing and manuscript preparation/revision, and she is “savvy” regarding research.  She provides “unsparing critique” and excellent feedback, but is always positive in how it’s done.  Additionally, she willingly accepts critique from others and in that way serves as a good role model for junior scientists and even more accomplished colleagues.

WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
I do not really see it as a weakness – in fact I see it as a strength – but some people do not appreciate her direct communication style.  She will not hold back if her opinion differs from others’ and she will say what’s on her mind if she believes it will lead to a better outcome.  She is never rude in how she does this, and the ultimate outcome is most often a better one after various perspectives have been explored.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.
She works harder than almost anyone I know.  She fulfills responsibilities and makes time in her schedule to do what’s expected of her (e.g., she devotes the 10% or so she is funded on my grant to grant activities and does not “shirk” them).

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).
Kit is very personable, fun, and a good companion and colleague.  She brings a high commitment to the nursing profession and to family nursing –having been involved in starting a new organization with that focus and organizing/planning the first international conference it will sponsor soon – and holds high standards for herself and others.  She supports and encourages others in a natural, sincere kind of way, and she is easy to work with.

DESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND © ADMINISTRATORS.
Kit has been a wonderful teaching colleague who is generous with and regularly gets very high marks from students.  She can convey difficult concepts in ways that students and colleagues understand, and she is effective as a lecturer, seminar facilitator, guest speaker, and professional conference presenter.  She is able to see where people are and help them know when they are ready for the next step (e.g., promotion, tenure), and is generous in praising others.  She works effectively with faculty and administrators here at UCSF.

PLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK
There are no concerns in these areas.  Clearly she can and does work independently, and her work is of the highest quality – she would not be so successful of that were not true – but she also is able to be a team member who allows others to take the lead.  She extends herself to our research team when we need to struggle with difficult issues and is willing to take on her share of the work.

WHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?
We will miss Kit terribly, but I understand her desire – at this point in her career – to move to a new environment that will offer new opportunities for growth, new networks, more “freedom” (i.e., in a private school), and more resources.  She has always worked quite effectively with Cathy Gilliss, and I know she is looking forward to that relationship.

DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?
Only that we surely will miss her in so many ways.  She truly has helped our department and our school be stronger.  Our loss is surely Duke’s gain.</ReferenceText>

Mark had a short collaboration with Kitzman at Wake, was not employed there. 
I.	Questions regarding any issues that were of concern from search committee’s discussion
Kitzman could not comment on Mark’s formal teaching skills because he has not been subject to that area. 
J.	Other comments from reference regarding the candidate’s employment or job performance
He said anyone that hired Mark would be extremely fortunate and that he hoped Mark would chose a place that allowed him to reach a higher potential. He said Mark is a natural leader.

<ReferenceText>I was asked by Crystal to provide some commentary as to why Dr. Lorimer did not want to provide a reference. Based on my notes, she felt ambivalent. She thought that as an individual Dr. Rende is a lovely person. However, she did not get a sense that Dr. Rende would be a good fit for the position. Specifically, according to Marcia, Dr. Rende does specialty care. The position would require teaching of general courses. As such, she did not feel that Dr. Rende, because she is specialized, would be the best person to teach general pediatric courses.</ReferenceText>

Faculty Search Committee
Applicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     

Applicant :    Deborah Mayer, Ph.D.                        				Position:   Senior Researcher

 Areas of Evaluation
1.	Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Mayer is a tenured Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, currently being reviewed for Full Professor. She has 77 peer review publications, 3 monographs, 1 book, and 10 book chapter. She has numerous poster and podium presentations. With respect to research funding, she lists 14 sources of research funding, of which after obtaining her Ph.D., is PI on four – note this not include her being PI on the P50, where she is site PI. Among these, one is from NIH/NCI, the remaining are from Centers or Disease Prevention and Control, South Atlantic American Cancer Society, and one from UNC. Three grants are pending.  

2.	Focused program of research.  Her research focus is on cancer survivorship issues, such as addressing the needs of survivors as they transition from care to longer term survivorship. This includes providing them access to information via eHealth interventions. 

3.	Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She has taught several courses related to oncology nursing (e.g., advanced concepts in oncology nursing, advanced pharmacology in oncology nursing, cancer survivorship, etc.), applications of ehealth, primary care management of adults, and management of complex health problem in adults. She has chaired one dissertation committee and has served on six; she also has chaired 10 thesis/Masters projects, and was a member of three. She has worked with six postdoctoral fellows. Overall, her teaching evaluations are consistently between 4.5 to 5.0 on a five point scale, as self-reported in her “Essay for Promotion to Professor” (see p.4). 

4.	Relevance and extent of clinical practice:   In the 80s and 90s, Dr. Mayer served as an oncology nurse specialist, staff nurse, nurse manager, chemotherapy nurse/nurse practitioner, and staff nurse. From 2000 to early 2003, she served as Chief Medical Offer for what appears to be a health service media company. She currently serves as a nurse practitioner in medical oncology in the Breast Program at the UNC Cancer Hospital while also serving on the steering committee on the UNC Lineberger Oncology Advanced Practice Providers.      

5.	Service to the profession.  She is currently a member on eight professional organizations (e.g., American Academy of Nursing) and is or has served in numerous capacities to the Oncology Nursing Society, ONS foundation, NCI, ACS, and Southeastern Cancer Study Group – she has been on several advisory boards. Dr. Mayer has served or is serving as a journal reviewer, and is currently the Editor to the Clinical Journal of Oncology, Nursing. She has served as a grant reviewer (e.g., ONS). She currently serves on several committees at UNC (e.g., Faculty Counsel, UNC Survivorship Program Steering Committee) at the School the School of Nursing (e.g., Search Committee).  

6.	Job stability:  From 2007 until present she has been at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and prior to then, four years at Tufts University. Overall, she has had job stability.

7.	Areas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Mayer can help substantially with teaching and clinical supervision of oncology nursing. She can also teach courses in informatics (e.g. , ehealth) and adult health. She has experiencing supervising Ph.D. students and chairing dissertation committees. 

Reviewer’s Recommendation:  
Dr.  Mayer has a strong publication record, it well recognized and respected, has mentored several students, appears to be an excellent instructor, and has contributed significantly to the field of oncology nursing in various capacities. If there are any concerns, it is that she has not obtained much external funding as a PI, especially in regards to NIH support. If a criterion to hire a senior level person is transferring established research funding, then this person does not qualify. However, given DUSON’s efforts to secure a senior level person in the area of oncology, the question is whether the Administration is willing to forego the above concern and interview her, given that she would like be competitive being promoted to Full Professor. I would suggest a follow-up phone interview based on the strong need to hire a more senior level person in oncology nursing.</ReferenceText>

A.	Nature of relationship between reference and candidate. I was Dr. Mayer’s chair in the Adult and Geriatric Health Division at UNC-Chapel Hill for 6 years.

B.	Describe candidate’s strengths related to position description. Dr. Mayer is a nationally known expert in oncology nursing, the former president of the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), and the current editor of the Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing. She is recognized as a leader in cancer survivorship. She was invited to be a member of the American Society for Clinical Oncology’s Survivorship Committee, one of only 2 nurses who are members of this group of 21 nationally recognized experts in survivorship care research. She also is chairing an interdisciplinary committee that is charged with developing national clinical guidelines for survivorship care plans. She has been funded for a number of studies and has an R01 under review. Dr. Mayer is committed to disseminating her research findings in quality peer-reviewed journals. Her papers are published in both  interdisciplinary and nursing journals such as the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, Cancer Nursing, and Journal of Cancer Survivorship, among others. Over her career she has published more than 75 papers in peer-reviewed journals, 10 book chapters, and many other types of publications. 


C.	Describe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement). She has not had an R01 but has had other funding.

D.	Describe candidate’s effectiveness of performing job responsibilities. She is an excellent researcher and teacher. I think one of her strengths is she can work within complex institutions and has established networks of value in implementing new projects and innovations. 

E.	Describe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate). Good interpersonal skills and can work with varied groups. 

F.	Describe candidate’s attitude/relationships with a) students, b) colleagues  c) administrators – Dr. Mayer is an excellent mentor with students at all levels – on two occasions at UNC I had recommended her for a University mentoring award, and both times she got to the “short list.” She is available to students and colleagues and gives of her time for their development.  Marilyn said she had an excellent relationship with Dr. Mayer as an administrator. If she ever asked Dr. Mayer to do anything- she went right out and did it, no questions asked, she feels like she would be an asset to DUSON.

-------------------------------------------------      
April 22, 2013

Dear Selection Committee, 

I am nominating Mary Lou Affronti for the Outstanding Capstone Project.  Her project entitled Adherence to Antiemetic Guidelines in Malignant Gliomas was an exemplary project conducted at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University.

In many ways Mary Lou Affronti has been a model DNP student. She entered the program with a clear understanding of how a DNP education could both contribute to her own professional growth and benefit her institution.  On admission, she had identified a project and continued with that same project throughout her studies.  She worked with an interdisciplinary team to assess barriers and facilitators to practice change and implement her project.  She was a true champion of ordering appropriate antiemetic medications for individuals with brain tumors who are receiving chemotherapy.  This is a vulnerable population who are often not able to advocate for their own supportive care.   During her proposal defense, I heard several individuals say “paying attention to supportive care measures is key to helping our patients tolerate treatments”.  

The implementation of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Antiemetic Guidelines was in response to a patient care need.  Mary Lou Affronti took a multifaceted approach to this practice change.  She included a provider education session, implementation of risk assessment tool with computerized standardized antiemetic guideline order-sets, and a monthly audit-feedback strategy.  A particular strength of this capstone project was that it incorporated a patient outcome measures.  She was able to demonstrate that adherence to antiemetic guidelines resulted in effective nausea/vomiting control in the patient population.  While the oncology community has been strong is evaluating data and outlining guidelines for care, often these guidelines are not readily adopted.  Ms. Affront’s project and article provide a blueprint for how to implement guidelines for cancer care at Duke and other cancer centers across the nation. 

Ms. Affronit is an independent self-directed to learner who set her own goals and deadlines and then stuck to them.  It has been an honor to work with such and outstanding student. Attached please find a letter of support from Dr. Katy Peters a physician at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University and a copy of the manuscript entitled Adherence to Antiemetic Guidelines in Patients with Malignant Glioma: Translating Evidence into Practice that was submitted April 12, 2013 for publication to the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  This is a high impact journal for an interdisciplinary oncology audience.  Dr. Henry Friedman, one of her committee members was so impressed with her capstone defense presentation that he highly encouraged her to submit to this journal.  

Thank you for your consideration,

I have worked alongside Dr Kaddoura first as a colleague attending meeting and working on committees.  I then hired Dr Kaddoura to teach a Pathophysiology course to the second year students of the radiography, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy and MRI students and now I work with Dr Kaddoura on a case study assignment for that class.  I have always been impressed by his energy and positive disposition.  It is contagious in the classroom and student who I thought would never participate are scrambling to answer questions or offer their opinion towards the end of the class.  He maintains order in a high active learning environment and is clear with students about the rules and demands of the course.  They follow him willingly and learn a great deal from the class and the exercises assigned.</ReferenceText>
