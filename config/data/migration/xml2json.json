The program only enrolls graduate, MSN, PhD students in nursing and other health related fields. Currently he teaches a couple of the informatics courses, evaluation of health systems and data management. He currently advises 4 doctoral students (chairs 2 committees and on 2 others) and works with a number of MSN students. Doctoral students write 3 publishable papers (conceptual, methods, and data driven) as part of their doctoral requirement. His reputation among students is one of “tough” and “conceptual”. All MSN students complete a synthesis of the literature for their final project that is a publishable paper (40-60% are published).\n\nTell me about the status of your funding?\n\nNo current funding.

My lack of knowledge of Chinese journals doe not mean her contributions are not valuable; it's just an unknown to me.  She has yet to complete her PhD or be licensed as an RN in the US.  Obviously, then, she has not practiced in the US, so I wonder about the extent to which she has sophisticated understanding of health care needs and practices to provide leadership as a researcher into such topics.  Only teaching experience is as a TA, though she has gotten awards for teaching and research assistant work.  Only 2 presentations (both in China).  Only 3 conferences attended, and none seem directly related to her area of expertise.  Small grants received, again all in China.

My review of her CV shows an amazingly accomplished individual between 1993 and 2005, after which her contributions decrease.  She left 3 different tenured positions (most unusual) and an endowed professorship (also quite unusual), and except for 7 years at UTHSC and 5 at Case, her appointments have been only 1-2 years each (which always concerns me).  Does have extensive teaching/faculty experience, including teaching a variety of courses, being involved in school/college committees, and advising dissertations … all of which are strengths, but not necessarily for the TI???  Recent reserrch positions in health care facilities have potential for excellent work related to translation, but this is not made clear in her material.  Many research-based publications in reputable journals, with a fairly solid, continuous record.  Extensive list of publications in proceedings/abstracts does not match presentations (which I would expect to be the case); if anything, there would be more publications since many confernces do not publish proceedings, but she has many fewer presentations.  In fact, there are no presentations listed since 2005.  As noted, publications in proceedings/abstracts that are research focused are much fewer in number in more recent years.  Had NINI funding 1997-2004, then nothing in 2005, and only several small grants since 2006; largest grant since 2006 ($125K) focused on community violence … a significant problem, but not at all aligned with prior or subsequent research foci.  Involved professionally and consults internationally.  Experience as coordinator for Taiwan WHO Collaborating Center through Case Western sounds valuable, but I'm not sure of the Taiwan/Case Western relationship in this.

(1) Asked about his short-term appointments at so many schools … He indicated these were all 1-year term appointments, as he did not have the PhD in hand and was not eligible for tenure track.  Worked at Seton Hall x 3 years while finishing PhD coursework there, then went to Southern CT (which was a bit closer to home).  Had hoped for a continued appointment there, but they were \"slow\" in making those appointments and in the meantime, he found the tenure track position at New Paltz.  Enjoys that work (RN/BSN program) and would not be thinking of leaving yet, but that program will close in spring 2010, so he is exploring other options.  (2)  Asked about his strengths as a faculty member & greatest contributions he could make to DUSON … He noted that he has taught many different courses (BSN & MSN) and feels comfortable with and likes that kind of flexibility.  Enjoys the challenge of teaching accelerated program students.  Describes himself as versatile and \"likes to do a lot of different things.\"  Currently practicing as a GNP which enhances his teaching.  He did not really speak to the contributions he could make.  (3)  Asked about his seemingly \"scattered\" focus (men in nursing, obesity, delegation, ASA toxicity, etc.) and what he sees as his primary area(s) of focus .. Said he is currently doing a secondary analysis of the LOADS of data from his dissertation (which was exploratory) and expects to continue that focus on leadership, delegation, role implementation, etc.  Also interested in educational practices and studying the effect of different approaches.  Did not articulate any specific plans RE publishing, grants, etc., but I did not pursue that question with him.  Did say that from looking at our website, he thought his interests aligned most closely with Ruth Anderson & Kristen Corrazzini and he would like to meet with them if he comes here for a visit to talk with them about common interests.  (4)  Asked about his current practice as a GNP, which was mentioned in his letter but not on his CV … Said this is a private practice of him, a Psych NP & a Social Worker, who work in a private-pay community and give support and guidance to elderly who may need help with placements or community resources, may need to be assessed and referred to an MD, etc.  He said it's a small practice that is somewhat \"informal\" & that's why he did not put it on his CV.  (5)  Asked about references … He will send a list of references to Crystal.  (6)  Asked if he had any questions of me … \"No.\"  Said he has looked through our website & talked with John Brion & has no specific questions at this point.  (7)  Overall, Scott seemed quite personable, self-confident, flexible, and knowledgeable of teaching & educational issues.  I recommend we move to next steps with him.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"205","CandID":"84","CommenterInitials":"LLD","DateOfComment":"2009-05-20T00:00:00","Comment":"Per 5/7/09 email:  VARIED BACKGROUND, GOOD TEACHING EXPERIENCE, LOOKS LIKE GOOD CANDIDATE.

Her principles, values and theoretical framework for working with community seemed appropriate, relevant, and compatible with the global (international and local) placements we have established.  I was pleased to hear her talk about how to integrate epidemiology, community assessment (comprehensive), community analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation into classroom and clinical.  She appeared to be an engaging teacher and committed to facilitating student growth. She has a healthy respect for communities of various cultural orientations and what nurses do independently and through interdisciplinary arrangements. She has 25 years of experience with refugee resettlement around the world, so understands cultural diversity. She discussed how and why palliative care and end of life were very positive community-based rotations and options. She is also interested in linking with the Institute on End of Life at the Divinity School. She asked questions about research and scholarship and wants to continue her work on palliative care and hospice. I was very impressed.

She does have teaching experience (at the undergrad & graduate levels), but I wonder about how committed she is to any program.  At present, she is on faculty at Mountain State U, Excelsior, U of Phoenix, & Penn State.  Now, I realize this may be an online course in 1 place in 1 semester, & another online course in another place in another semester, but it seems like she wants to do it all and, as a result, does not seem to focus anywhere.  Her \"regular\" teaching appointments were, again, for only 1 or 2 years at a time.  The information provided about publications does not indicate full citations, so it's hard to tell what the works are or how significant they might be.  Most of her publications are guides to practice, but they do not seem to be evidence syntheses; the only research-focused \"publication\" is her dissertation in the ProQuest digital DB.  Additionall, the topics of her publications range from critically ill children, to test taking, to trauma, to the nursing shortage, to risk management, to statistics, to the health care team.  A clear focus does not emerge for me.  Her induction into the Knights of Malta and appointment to the Disaster Medicine Sub-committee of the Society of Critical Care Medicine are interesting, though I have no idea what's involved in the former or what the impact of the latter was.

She completed her PhD in April 2009 & is now doing a PostDoc at Texas.  She is working on an NIH grant, for which she will be the PI if it is funded … but from which she would withdraw should she get a position here at DUSON.  The grant focuses on creating a portal for diabetes patients to access selected clinical information from their EMR, look at how their blook work (for example) compares with national standards, upload their finger stick data, engage in social networking, etc.  The assumption is that all this will have a positive impact on patient compliance with management regimes.  \n\nWhen asked why she is interested in a teaching position (particularly in light of the fact that she has had no such experience in the past), she indicated she wanted the opportunity to work with colleagues, to do both research and teaching, to share her knowledge & expertise in Informatics, & to stay abreast of developments in her field.  She did not say anything about facilitating student learning, helping to create the next generation of nurse informaticists, etc.  When asked about why she is interested in DUSON, she replied that it is a well respected school & would provide a \"nice opportunity.\"\n\nHer interest in Informatics grew out of her work with software implementation projects at a job, & she \"got hooked\" on the concepts.  When asked about what kind of impact she hoped her work/contributions would have, she spoke about designing screens for EMRs that would allow each nurse to select the kind of data she wants to see for a particular patient, given that patient's situation.  This interest is related to her dissertation work, which focused on how clinical nurses think about organizing knowledge & presenting information.\n\nShe has recently submitted a revised manuscript to Advances in Nursing Science & believes that the combination of her expertise in Informatics AND her many years in nursing/hospital administration provides a unique perspective she could bring to DUSON.  She did not elaborate on this, however.\n\nFor what it's worth, she sounded very nice, but I was not very impressed with her insight or vision.

Her master's is in nursing administration, and it is not clear what kind of PhD  program she is in … though her letter says she is studying the experience of older male informal caregivers.  I would have liked to read some elaboration of why that is an important area to study and/or how she intends to pursue this line of investigation after the PhD.  While she has extensive experience in staff development and the positions she has held are varied, she has no academic teaching experience and all of her employment has been within the Duke system, which (in my opinion) limits the perspectives and broad experience she might bring to a faculty position.  She also does not document any significant experience in community health (though she dos hold a certificate in Core Public Health Concepts …whatever that means), which is a major limitation in considering anyone for a FT faculty position to teach such material.  Her publications are limited, and the 2 more recent ones (2006 and submitted/in review) that are listed provide very sketchy information … for example, who is the publisher on the one that's in review? and what were the titles of the chapters in the 2006 book?  She lists only one research activity (in 19990, and her presentations are primarily local or regional.  The presentation at the 2009 NLN Summit was a poster.  Her only recent (2009) \"professional achievement\" is Team STEPPS Master Trainer, but she does not say what she has done with that training, how it has helped her contribute professionally, etc.  She has been involved in some local/regional professional associations, but not for some time.  Finally, her letter speaks to her teaching philosophy, which is nice, but it is not particularly powerful, insightful, or convincing.  While I believe our Committee's response to this candidate should be handled personally, I believe the response we must send her is that we cannot recommend pursuit of her for this position.

She has not yet completed her PhD, and while her research experience (as a research assistant on many projects and a PI and co-investigator on 2 [seemingly] small projects in China in 2000-2002) provides a good foundation for future work, she has no funding, shows no evidence of writing major grants, and has not been the lead investigator on a major project.  Her 2 semesters as a TA at UNC and 7 years teaching in China document good and varied experience as a teacher, but I do not think this is particularly needed for the OGACHI position.

Nevertheless, he is appropriately credentialled … the MS in Health Systems would seem to be a plus, as would the graduate certificate in Management of Technology … though (unlike someone else's comment), I'm not sure I see how a PhD in Economics would be particularly helpful.  He has 5 years teaching experience at ASU and some TA experience; this and his thesis supervision seem to be appropriate for our needs.  His publications are a bit limited (2 of them seem to be related to Informatics, he has none in 2009, 3 in 2008, 1 in 2007, 1 in 2006, and all others are 2003 or earlier).  He does, however, have 5 manuscripts in review, and 2 of them seem particularly relevant to Informatics.  I have no idea what \"working papers\" are, and on the 4 \"work in progress\" things listed, it is unclear to me what that means or what the status of these projects are.  He has been the PI on 2 very small grants and co-PI on several others (2 of which were more than $100K).  His paper presentations related to Informatics are limited -- like his publications -- with one accepted for a year from now, 1 in 2008, a few in 2006, and a few earlier than that.

Her background in public health makes her suitable for the OGACHI position, but she does not have any original research to date. While she is the third author (usually) on pubs, not the first, although she may have been the primary writer.

However, working in someone else's shadows, she has not distinguished herself as  a researcher. She seems to be able to conceptualize and stratgically plan for where the office should and can move in the research arena, but again that is administration not necessarily research. She has interest in a number of public health areas of interest to OGACHI and for which she would welcome the opportunity to learn, and I lelieve OGACHI would proposer through her involvement.

She seems to have prepared herself in genetics through the popular channels: Georgetown (Molecular Genetics)and at the NIH at the Summer Generics Institute.

Currently, she works with a pharmaceutical company  part-time invoved in clinical trials. She has two scholarly posters, no publications to-date, and several small grants through state tobacco money. I am impressed that this is a relatively young nurse who seems to be academically strong and destine on developing into an expert in genetics  research as evident by her preparation and study on African American women and breast cancer.

Dr Cullins works as nurse practitioner with Planned Parenthood 8 hours per week and FT in the summer doing complete physical, managing the birth control clinic, and managing male and female patients with STDs. A a sub PI with Dolby Pharmaceuticals, she does complete physicals as part of the protocols of clinical trials. She teaches in both the undergraduate and graduates programs at Southern University. At the BS level, she teaches leadership; at MS level, she teaches advanced health assessment to the nurse practitioner students. She integrates genetics content into advanced health assessment. Her dean has charged her to integrate genetics into all relevant nursing courses by 2014. She has one publication (2nd author) , Breast Cancer Fatalism and Breast Cancer Screening in African American Women (2006).  She described the experience in the NIH Summer Genetics Institute as comprehensive and that participants were required to do their own analyses under the supervision of mentors.  She does not see herself at this time as a major researcher, but has an interest in translational studies and ensuring that she is always practicing EBP. She deliberately elected the DNP program because she wanted a career combining practice and education. A PhD might be in her future, but not currently under consideration.  She wants to continue her work with  African American and Latino women with breast cancer and incorporate genetics into the practice. She intends to publich more. There was no overwhelming reasons for applying to Duke, other than she was seeking what opportunities might exist across a selective number of schools.

Before then, she worked with the American Heart Association where she was the Health Initiatives Director.  In that role, she worked across disciplines around developing community-based projects primarily around stroke. Her experiences in that role helped her to value research as the basis for rehabilitation care and policy development. Her post-doctoral fellowship (2007) under the aegis of a T-32 at UPENN provided her with the opportunity to join interdisciplinary teams in aging research. She co-taught social policy and program evaluation at UPENN. Although she had an MD as her post-doc research advisor, she sees Mary Naylor at UPENN as her primary mentor and advisor at that institution.\n\nDr. Bettger is interested in Duke because she believes the resources and the interdisciplinary spirit of collaboration are what she is seeking for her career development. If the fit is good, she could move in the summer of 2010. When we discussed the possible linkages here, she noted she currently is not eligible for a VA appointment because she is a Canadian citizen, however in the right situation she would relinquish that for U.S. citizenship. She sees her research colleague matches at DUSON as being Drs. Anderson, Gilliss, Davis and Vorderstrasse. She mentioned that she can teach health care policy and program evaluation and would need a bit of protected time to initiate her research program. \n\nMy impression is that this individual will be a good addition to many research teams within and outside of DUSON but will need a mentor to become an independent investigator.

Although not officially announced, she is scheduled to teach Organizational Theory to doctoral students in the fall. In her role as TA, she develops teaching plans, delivers instructional sessions, collaborates in the development of examinations and helps score exams. She has taken a course on teaching as a part of her doctoral curriculum and has focused on MS  and PhD teaching.  \n\nThere are two positions, she describes as executive leadership positions: (1) Manager of a Quality Improvement Committee at a clinic where she worked (details listed in CV); (2) Project Manager  for the reaccreditation self-study in the School of Public Health @ UNC. When asked how she got this position, she explained that she had been in the School of Public Health for 6 years and had gained the respect of the dean and associate dean. She noted that she was also selected for a university merit award as a MS student and consequently, was able to secure funding throughout the MS program. Consequently, she was well known, well regarded and her skills well recognized. She thought the position was much like a very large research project, so in that sense, she  was able to use some of the knowledge and skills aquired through her studies in Health Services Research. She worked on the reaccreditation project for 1.5 years, from mid-point to completion. \n\nDespite the two projects she worked on, she has had no official position as a health services researcher or as an executive level leader. \n\nThe applicant's research is rooted in failed quality improvement innovations.

Her primary interest is in health promotion and tobacco useage. However, in responding to the current focus of projects in OGACHI, she indicated that she has also been working with Chronic Diseases in Jordan . Her description of the rise in chronic diseases in Jordan parallels the trajectory in the Caribbean. She has not specifically focused on aging. She feels she is effective in developing research grants and grants to do project evaluation. When questioned about value of grants developed in Jordan (as the dollar value of only one from Jordan was listed), she noted a half a million dollars was granted for a  partnership project to enhance nursing education at the Jordan University of Science & Technology. As to the absence of amount for other \"funded grants\" listed, she said she could send that to me and that it was not customary to list amount in Jordan.I found this curious and inconsistent and she did not just offer to verbally provide dollar amounts.    It appears that she was PI on three awards on smoking  from Jordon University of Science and Technology;  and PI on a pilot study apparently associated with a NIH  P-20 award to another person (2008-09). Dr. Haddad has a RO-1 application in review (Second hand smoke among Jordanian women and children). She is hopeful that her application will be scored.  She noted that she applied for the DUSON position because she felt her career  and passion was not moving as she had hoped at VCU. She noted that she spends most of her time teaching at the BSN (Community Health) , MSN (Healthy Planning Course), and PhD levels (Nursing Education) and not as much time to travel globally to do projects and conduct her research. Despite this, VCU has paid for her to make two trips to Jordon to continue her research on tobacco and smoking cessation. In summary, she expressed interest in the scope of the work being done through OGACHI and asked if we might be able to connect her with a collaborator in tobacco use and health promotion in Caribbean (the answer was yes).   We also talked about the potential for expansion to other parts of the world.

This was a “cold call” that had not been scheduled in advance, but when I offered to arrange something for a future date, Dr. Mullen indicated she would be happy to talk with me now.  She confirmed that she completed her PhD on March 1st of 2010 and that she continues to work for HealthPartners, but is “ready to move.”\n\nI asked about her teaching and what she thought she could contribute at DUSON.  She noted that she has taught leadership/management in an MBA program and is now teaching as an adjunct in 2 MHA programs.  She believes leadership/management principles are relevant to many courses and programs and would feel comfortable teaching those topics.  She also has taught policy development – particularly in relation to health care ethics, research ethics, and research methods – and would be comfortable addressing these topics in a research methods course.  \n\nDr. Mullen had not looked at the DUSON website in a few months, so she could not identify specific courses we offer as ones she could teach, but she did say that in general she could teach methods (e.g., data analysis, research, critical reading of research), health care delivery systems and organizations, organizational behavior, leadership, ethics, management, and teamwork.  She seemed to talk more about classes or concepts rather than taking responsibility for an entire course, but I did not “drill down” to that level of detail with her.\n\nAs for working with large data sets, Dr. Mullen said she is very experienced with this, both through her employment and her education.  She has worked for ten years on data integration, analysis, and reporting but was unable to publish any of that work because it was proprietary.  She is comfortable doing surveys and knowledgeable about how data flows through care delivery systems and the caveats to consider regarding the use of those data.\n\nWhen I asked about her research interests, she did not seem to be particularly focused.  She talked about wanting to know more about (1) health care practitioners, the systems in which they work, and how their roles are changing and (2) patient outcomes  …  but her “interest” in both areas was vague and unfocused.  She currently is involved (as a member of the scientific and recruitment committees) with a team from the University of Minnesota that is conducting research related to the effect of bariatric surgery vs. no surgery for overweight (though not obese) diabetics.  This study has data collection sites in New York (in collaboration with Columbia University) and Taiwan, as well as Minnesota.\n\nDr. Mullen sounded lovely on the phone and seemed energetic and interested in moving in a new direction, now that her PhD is completed.  She does not, however, have “executive leadership of complex organizations” experience, not does she have “an active program of research” or “graduate nursing education teaching experience” (though she does have experience teaching at the master’s level in other fields), all of which are noted in the position description.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"536","CandID":"217","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2010-04-15T00:00:00","Comment":"An interesting candidate, but I see nothing in her CV that speaks to health services research.

First of all, I wonder why someone who was tenured at WVU left in the same year she was tenured and why she is now looking at a new position when she was just tenured at UNC in 2009.  I was disappointed that she did not speak to this in her material, as I find it a bit troubling.  Second, I do not understand how one individual can hold 6 \"academic\" appiontments at the same time, along with her Advisory Board role in China (which I consider to be \"service\") and her role as a Senior Fellow at an Institute in Shanghai (which is not clear as to what it involves).  While she has been well funded and has two grants under review, the focus of her work is unclear … ranging from oral health and cognitive function in elders, to epidemiological studies of dementia, to cognitive and physical functioning of siblings in China, to a cost analysis of long term care services.  Most of the populations under study are the elderly, but I do not see a clear program of research emerging here.  She is a prolific writer, with 2 articles in revision, 5 under review, 3 in press, and many already published.  As for presentations, she lists many \"abstracts submitted,\" several accepted for presentation, and several invited keynote addresses.  She has been the sole instructor for 8 different courses, was nominated (in 2007) for the WVU SOM distinguished teacher award, and has been teaching courses (here and there) since 2002.  Her honors are impressive, and she is quite involved in professional service activities.  Finally, her letter is strong and well-written.  Despite these strengthsI do have two questions/concerns … (1)  She is not a nurse and has had no experience with a school of nursing.  Could that be a limitation in what she can contribute to the work of OGACHI?  (2)  It was my understanding that we said NO to another candidate because her international work was not in the Caribbean.

She was in an airport, and we had many interruptions from announcements being made there, but we did have a good conversation.  It was sometimes difficult to understand her – partly because of the airport announcements and partly because of her accent – but she can be understood easily with a little extra bit of attention.  She was articulate, open, answered all of my questions honestly, and expressed a sincere interest in the possibilities offered by this position with OGACHI.\n\n(1) I asked her about leaving 2 tenured positions … She said that she left WVU when her husband took a position in NC (in the Research Triangle), and while she is happy at UNCG, she is excited about the opportunities this position presents and would very much enjoy being able to focus more on international work.\n\n(2) I asked her about holding 6-8 positions simultaneously and how she manages them … She explained that most of these positions are “in title only:” (my words, not hers) and do not require extensive investment of her time.  The appointments in China allow her to give presentations when she visits there and to work with colleagues there on research projects.  The Research Fellow position at UNC-CH also “keeps the door open” for collaborative projects.  And the faculty appointments at UNC-CH and WVU are there because she typically does a guest lecture or two at each school.  She obviously is able to manage all this and still maintain an active research program and strong international partnerships.\n\n(3) I asked her about the transition from dentistry to nursing and how she would prepare herself to learn more about nursing perspectives and issues if she were to be in this position  …  She did not address that second part of this question, but in response to the first part, she talked about how her current and past work has helped her understand how many residents in long term care facilities have poor oral health … and how vital nurses are to solving that problem.  She talked about the need to better prepare nurses in LTC to provide better oral health to the elderly.\n\n(4) I asked her to summarize her area(s) of expertise … She identified (a) international aging, (b) long term care, and (c) oral health disparities.\n\nWe talked about her current research activities and writing projects, and she reinforced what was in the CV.  Indeed, she is an active researcher and prolific writer.  She reported that she was in the airport on her way home after having been in DC for a few days, serving on an expert panel for NIH to review grants … an appointment that supports her expertise as a researcher and attests to the respect she has in that community.\n\nFinally, Dr. Wu reminded me about keeping her inquiry confidential, and I asked about her preferences for next steps … meeting only with the Search Committee, or moving ahead with a full visit as soon as it can be arranged.  She was hesitant, so I asked if she would like to think about this.  She ended up saying she would go along with whatever we thought would work best, and would be happy with the 2-day visit if it can be worked out.  She will be in China between July 9th and August 8th.  \n\nMy conversation with Dr. Wu reinforced the Committee’s sense that she is a strong candidate for the OGACHI position, and I recommend that we move to the next step of a visit.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"558","CandID":"228","CommenterInitials":"DLP","DateOfComment":"2010-06-30T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant has had an extensive career in corporate positions associated with the pharmaceutical industry/bio-medical informatics.

Some sections were in chronological order, and others were in reverse chronological order.  In many instances, I found myself asking what the candidate's role was in a project that was listed (e.g., the 8 \"demonstration projects\" listed under Professional Career and 2 funded projects listed under DUSON employment.  Nevertheless, the candidate has several strengths and other areas that are not as strong.  \n\nShe holds an MSN in Gerontological Nursing and has engaged in clinical practice, writing, scholarly projects, teaching, presentations, and professional association work related to this population.  Her focus on care of the elderly is clear, but I was surprised to see that her areas of research interest no longer include the problem of incontinence, which seemed to be such a specialty of hers for many years.  In addition, she expects to complete her PhD in December 2010. Her research interest include urinary incontinence; her disseration addresses heart failure in African Americans. This suggest her potential contributions to growing a focus on health disparities research, as well as continuing her interest in geriatrics.\n\nThis candidate is well-known to DUSON as a CI (a role she also held at UNC for many years), project team member, and co-author.  She has taught at both DUSON and UNC, but she has not had responsibility for a full course.  Her teaching has been as a CI or guest lecturer.  As a CI, she has collaborated with colleagues to develop an innovative project with DUSON ABSN students related to leadership, and she has presented on this project at DUSON CI orientation programs.\n\nHer most recent national presentation (a poster) was in 2008; I am not certain who sponsored the 10th Anniversary Baccalaureate Education Conference at which this poster was presented.  Her international presentations have been primarily through OGACHI, with the most recent being in 2007.  However, she is a prolific writer, and she is active in several professional organizations.  Most of her publications are as part of a team, but she does have some single-author publications; most of the articles listed are in well-respected, peer-reviewed journals.\n\nFinally, the candidate expresses a commitment to innovations in teaching, and to the preparation of new and advanced practice nurses.  She has taken courses to enhance her teaching competencies and plans to take the exam to be certified as a nurse educator.\n\nI know this candidate personally and have some concerns about her ability to focus, be succinct, and allow the spotlight to shine on others.  However, she does bring the academic preparation and experience that are congruent with a clinical faculty position in the ABSN program, and I would support interviewing her if that is the recommendation of the Committee.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"560","CandID":"226","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2010-07-05T00:00:00","Comment":"I know that Dorothy is a reference for this candidate, so I am hoping that her input can help me change my mind.  But a careful review of this candidate's material does not lead me to recommend that we pursue her.  Here is what I see as strengths and concerns …\n\nHer MSN preparation is in Med-Surg, and she has taught and practiced in this area.  However, her most recent clinical practice ended in 1995, and I would question how current she is to teach in the ABSN program.\n\nThe research projects she lists do not have a clear focus, few have been funded, and none is more recent than 2000.  Her most recent publication is from 2004, and she has no publications in refereed journals.  Similarly, her most recent professional presentation was in 2000, and none have been at significant national or international conferences.  This candidate does not have a sustained record of substantive scholarly work.\n\nShe held certification in Nursing Administration, but that expired 15 years ago.  She maintains membership in 2 professional associations but has not been actively involved for quite some time.  Additionally, while she lists a variety of contributions to employing institutions, (a) she notes that she is presently serving on 2 committees at Clemson, even though she left that position in 2002, and (b) her only involvement in her current school is on the Nursing Department's Curriculum Committee, not what I would expect from a Full Professor.\n\nShe does have a total of 17 years teaching experience and has taught a variety of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  Additionally, she has served on thesis and \"special problem\" committees (whatever the latter are!).  She has received several awards for teaching and curriculum, which support strength in these areas, but they were all local awards … none were from state, regional or national groups.\n\nFinally, I was disappointed in her letter.  It's a \"history\" of going from A to B, but it offers no insights about her strengths or the unique contributions she could make to DUSON.  I do not see any real strengths in this candidate and would recommend that we not pursue her.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"561","CandID":"228","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2010-07-05T00:00:00","Comment":"This is a candidate with extensive leadership, global and corporate experiences.

She has worked for a non-traditional health care system in central New Jersey, Meridian Health, over the past five years as a nurse researcher/nurse scientist. The health system's  EB initiative started five years ago when Dr. Bernadette Melneck (?) and other leading edge nurse scientists in EBP were invited to Meridan to teach the staff about the approach and to assist them in designing a framework for practice for their health system based on EBP.  \n\nThe framework was adopted and Hedges works with four other nurses in the promotion of the approach throughout the health system,. They have evolved an Institute for EBP where four topics have been nominated for the Institute to work on for problem solving. Dr. Hedges is not the leader of the initiatives, but a strong member of the team having been involved since its inception and engagded in the day to day EBCare work of the system and the Institute.\n\nMeridian Health, in conjunction with Georgian Court University,  developed the first generic BSN program in the two county area.

I also note that she has held no position for more than 1.5 years, and while I understand that she has been a student for most of her career to date, I am a bit concerned about so many \"short stints.\"  Also, she indicates holding adjunct and CI positions, but it is unclear if she has ever held a FT faculty position.

She is involved professionally (holding the position of president in the VNA district #4) and has served on committees and advisory boards of other institutions (e.g., Maryview Medical Center and Old Dominion U).  Given the focus of her research, I was surprised to see that she was a member of the National Black Nurses Association for only 2 years, and that such membership ended in 2007.  Her research focus is clear, and she has published on relational aggression in well-respected journals and presented posters at national conferences; her presentations (other than posters) have been only at local conferences (i.e., those in the institutions where she was a student or staff).  She has had several P-20 grants; the status of the other \"grants submitted\" is unclear, though I would assume they were not funded.

He talked (with excitement and passion) about his work in Informatics, particularly telemedicine, where he evaluates the technology used, manages a lab (where they develop protocols and teach healthcare providers how to use the equipment), and is quite \"hands on.\"  For his PhD, he studied the coordination and communication that did and did not happen when, using telemedicine, outpatients were referred … what information is critical to share, and how significant the EMR is.  He has always been interested in education and wants to be a teacher.  He described himself as articulate (and he was!), comfortable with technology itself, able to use technology in real-life situations, and interested in exploreing system changes.  He is a qualitative researcher who loves ethnographic studies.  He is currently involved in work related to image processing, especially via telemedicine, and studying if smaller files (that have less intensity of images) \"work\" to make diagnoses.  He has hosted students from Mexico at the U of Texas and designed a summer experience for them that included Informatics courses, projects, and interviews with experts and researchers in the field.  He talked about convincing the UT admininstration to incorporate iPods and iTunes to support student learning, and leading efforts on that campus to help faculty across all 6 schools use the iTunes platform … an initiative that called on his administrative, technical, and negotiation skills.  He has been a member of several research teams and learned much from that, but now he wants to take the lead on research studies and be more independent as a researcher.  He is \"absolutely\" interested in teaching and believes his work with master's and doctoral students (during and since his own time in the PhD student role) have helped him develop skills of teaching, mentoring and guiding others.  In addition, he has co-taught courses (e.g., interface design and intro to health care Informatics) and has completed courses in educational theory.  He is a member of the regional Board of HIMSS and has responsibility for supporting their online platform and their newsletter.

Her direct clinical experience is old (1975), limited (1 year only), and not in MCH, which is where her graduate clinical specialization is; however, she notes that she has been teaching didactic and clinical throughout her 35 years as an educator, and one would assume that she maintains currency regarding clinical practice through her work with students.

He interviewed well and think his personality would be a good fit with the DUSON culture.  He has assisted with HRSA grant writing, has been a co-PI for clinical research at DUHS, and has published.  He has certainly demonstrated clinical expertise and leadership as an advanced practice nurse in acute care and neurosurgery.  His areas of teaching passion include acute care and neurology for nurses/ APRNs.  Although his prior research has been primarily clinical research, his future research interests include outcomes research evaulating various teaching methods.  He has completed his DNP here at Duke so he does have some knowledge of DUSON.\nHe clearly articulates his strengths being his clinical expertise and his weakness being his lack of faculty experience and lack of formal preparation for the faculty role.\nHis short and long term goals as a faculty member are to improve his abilities and competence as an educator, to grow the ACNP program, and to increase the programs visibility and ranking nationally.  He spoke about identifying mentors at DUSON to work with him in growing as a faculty member.  He was not very clear about specific strategies to grow the ACNP program or improve the national rankings.  He also states that he would like to continue practicing in addition to being an educator.  He would also like to continue building his international relationships with advanced practice nursing training in Germany of which he was instrumental in developing.\nAlthough this candidate is an expert clinician, has published and has been involved in clinical research, my big concern with this candidate is that he is a novice educator with no full time faculty experience.  I am unsure that he has a full appreciation for the scope of the faculty role outside of teaching.\nSince he has taught for DUSON as an adjunct faculty member, I would be interested to view his evaluations and speak with lead faculty who have worked with him.

Her PhD focus (Health Studies/Higher Education) and dissertation (CAI) seem relevant to a teaching role, and her MSN preparation is relevant to the practice component of the teaching role.  She has experience as a teacher of various types of students, has been involved in the broader scope of the role (e.g., SON and university committees), and has served as a clinical instructor and preceptor for MSN WHNP students, both of which enhance her understanding of student learning needs, etc.  Her practice experience is quite impressive, and she seems to have combined an interest in education with an interest in clinical practice -- \"introduced and integrated hybrid-online compoment\" of a program at TWU, \"developed Women & HIV curriculum\" at TX/OK AIDS Education & Training.  She has one 2008 article in a well-respected journal, but nothing more current; and while her published posters are current, they are from local events for the most part.  She does list 4 manuscripts \"in progress,\" but none have been submitted to date.  She has had some national presentations and several small grants, again from primarily local sources.  The recent Fellowship at U Michigan is impressive and fits with her research interests (which are clearly articulated in her letter), her service as a consultant to CDC is laudable, and the research study for which she is a co-PI sounda most interesting.  She keeps current by attenting conferences and is a member of associations that are relevant to her area of expertise, though she documents no involvement in those associations (e.g., committee member).

She finished PhD in 2005 and decided to work as a clinician to “recover” from her doctoral work.  She never intended to do “academia” and did not really have a good idea of what academia entailed, but she really enjoyed precepted teaching.  \n\nAs a student in her undergraduate program Dr. Reid was told that she would not be able to advance in her nursing career, and therefore she had viewed academicians as being very non supportive of students.   After 2 years post her doctorate she decided that she wanted to give academia a try because she enjoyed teaching and felt that it would help facilitate her research.  However, she did not really know the difference between a teaching and a research institution.  She decided to accept the position at UNC Wilmington because both the Dean and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs were African American and could provide guidance for her as a new African American faculty member.  \n\nAfter a couple of years at UNC Wilmington Dr. Reid understands that she needs a more research intensive institution if she wants the support the conduct of her research. She has been in contact with Dr. Barrsso since coming to NC, and feels that Duke will be able to support her in her scholarship as both an educator and researcher.  Currently she teaches 3-4 classes per semester which makes it difficult to advance her scholarship.  This semester she is teaching advanced health assessment, a women’s health clinical course, and two sections of clinical reasoning.  All of these courses are taught online. She has also taught maternal newborn, research methods, and a farm worker health course.   She misses practice and would like to be able to engage in a small clinical practice.  \n\nDr. Reid is Co-PI for the HIV Nurse Network Wilmington location, out of UCSF, with over 1,700 women.   She has a manuscript in process from this data.  In addition, she has 2 other manuscripts from pilot work that she hopes to have submitted by the first of the year.  This scholarship was advanced in part through her acceptance in the a competitive process for the Interdisciplinary Emerging Scholars Network.  During this month long program at the University of Michigan she attended classes all day and was able to obtain assistance in the analysis of her pilot studies.  \nDr. Reid is seeking an environment in which she can advance the knowledge development related to self-care management of African American womens with HIV and educate nurses in the care of maternal newborn and women’s health care.\nI recommend the continued recruitment of Dr. Reid and will proceed with her reference checks.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"723","CandID":"266","CommenterInitials":"MEZ","DateOfComment":"2010-12-14T00:00:00","Comment":"I had a very nice conversation with Dr Alemi on Dec 9th by telephone.

I was not very impressed with her answers and discussion about nursing education and being a nursing educator.  She is a current DNP student at DUSON with a defense date set for Apr 5, 2011.  She is interested in a FNP teaching position and is very interested in having a 50% teaching load and 50% clinical practice.  When asked why she wanted to teach she mentioned her nurse faculty loan repayment program, then after a little coaxing she mentioned that she had a lot of knowledge that she would like to pass along to NP students.  She has done some very intersting work with the school based health system and her DNP project is very interesting as well.  I am unsure that her work and expertise in school based health, early childhood and special needs children fits the needs of the FNP program.  When asked what she could teach or what she wants to teach she mentioned family planning, maternal child health, adolescent and child health, as well as epidemiology.  Her answers were very shallow when asking her about teaching/ learning, approach in the classroom, etc.  Quite frankly, I expected more especially from someone who has taken some nursing educator courses here at Duke.  I do not think that she has the breadth of current experience or knowledge in diverse populations across the lifespan to meet the needs of the FNP program.

She is on track to defend her PhD dissertation in Summer 2011, but the U of Michigan does not set up defense dates until about a month in advance.  I told her of our practice of needing a confirmed defense date in order to move forward with the process for a candidate.  In light of this, I recommend that we do not proceed with checking references at this point.  However, I will comment on my discussion with Jina.\n\nWhen asked what attracted her to our position, she responded that the focus on health-related issues she would find in a SON was very appealing.  She has been studying how a \"community\" can help a patient with diabetes deal with managing that illness, and being in an environment that shared the interest in health-related issues was attractive.  Of course, she also commented on Duke's reputation, etc.\n\nJina has \"taught\" for 4 years, but it was clear that the course was designed and all lectures were given by the FT professors … and her role was to lead discussion groups with students, and do an occassional lecture here and there.  She has never had responsibility for designing and implementing a course.  The courses in which she was involved focused on contextual inquiry (i.e., how organizations work, the systems it uses for communication and operations, and workflow issues), project management, information search & retrieval, information processing models, and interviewing techniques.  She sounded quite comfortable when talking about these topics.\n\nWhen asked about the unique strengths she would bring to our school, Jina indicated that she had looked at our website, including the Informatics courses and faculty.  She knows Dr. Johnson's work very well, and she knows Dr. Peace's as well, but to a lesser extent.  Jina believes that her expertise in human-computer action would complement the expertise of these other faculty, and her expertise related to adopting information systems in healthcare settings would align well with the focus of our program.\n\nIn terms of the mentoring/guidance she thought she would need were she to join the faculty, she identified a better understanding of nursing issues and practice (to put her information systems expertise into that \"real\" context) and of the culture of our SON and healthcare.  She expressed a desire to collaborate with nursing faculty on projects and in teaching.\n\nThis candidate sounded mature, confident but not arrogant, and passionate about issues surrounding human-computer interaction.  She has some publications and presentations, and seems to have strength in both the broad field of informatics/ information management and the narrower area of human-computer interaction.

He indicated he will be defending his PhD dissertation on January 7th.   The most appealing piece of our description for this position is the opportunity to collaborate with others, as that is what Mr. V sees as one of his strengths.  He has had experience working with a nursing school in India, providing Stats support to faculty as they developed research projects … working with them on research design and data analysis.  In that school, he was an Instructor, teaching Stats to master's students for 4 years and supporting students with their theses.\n\nMr. V expressed an enjoyment of working on teams.  He said he puts in a great deal of time and energy to get a clear understanding of the topic (i.e., \"what the essence of the problem is\") and that \"people liked the way I handled it, working with them\" … though he was vague on this last idea and provided no further elaboration.\n\nHe has written NIH grants with faculty and reviewed the Stats sections of others' grants.\n\nIn terms of his teaching, Mr. V indicated he has been the lead instructor for courses.  He says he focuses on concepts more than formulas and uses many examples to enhance learning.  He incorporates a great deal of \"hands-on\" experiences for students, as his goal is to train students to be comfortable with how to approach a problem and ultimately be on their own.  His greatest reward as a teacher is when students find they actually LIKE Stats.\n\nWhen asked what he was looking for in a job, Mr. V responded:  50-60% collaboration, 25-30% teaching, 20% of my methodological work and extending my own research.  His doctoral study looks at recurrent data and missing data problems, and multivariate analysis.  He has focused on shaken baby syndrome and re-submitted a grant to NIH to study the implications of this problem on children (e.g., mental health, developmental).  This is a mult-country study.  In addition, he is involved in a project related to communication disorders in collaboration with a School of Medicine in India; he anticipates limited travel associated with this project but is likely to have to do some.\n\nMr. V was articulate, responded to my questions easily, and seemed most confident in his area of expertise.  I am checking references and will post them in the \"references\" section of the DB.

She has had a PhD since 1988 and (in my opinion) has little to show for having that credential for 22 years.  She has been as Associate Professor at cincinnati for 18 years … I wonder why she did not apply for or was not successful in going for promotion to Full Professor?  If her research accomplishments are so stellar, she surely should have been promoted.  I also wonder why -- after holding a number of educational administrative positions (including Associate Dean for Academic Affairs) she went back to a faculty position … and is now interested in teaching ABSN students.\n\nRESEARCH  …  I do not see that she has any significant funding.  She currently has a 5-year $1M grant from MIOSH, which is nice, and she has a $300K grant from RWJF.  However, eacof those grants has a different focus and shows no building of a clear program of research.  Her other grands are all small, and some are internal.  It seemed that the focus of her research is on workplace issues, and her letter says that her \"program of research deals with leadership behaviors, nursing culture, and role implementation of healthcare workers.\"  However, many of her publications and presentations focus on pressure ulcers (and other topics), so a clear \"program of research\" does not emerge for me.  Based on all this, I do not see her as a candidate for the Researcher at all.\n\nTEACHING  …  She has extensive teaching experience in BSN, MSN, DNP and PhD programs, including dissertation committee member and chair.  However, I wonder what she would teach in our ABSN program that would help meet our teaching needs.  It seems we have faculty who can teach the leadership course, but what we need are people to provide leadership in our clinically-focused courses.  And I do not see her as a viable candidate for that.  She last taught Health Assessment in 2004, and the last time she taught Adult Health was in 1992 … hardly current to teach our students.  She does seem to have done some projects related to simulation and other technologies, her PhD is in Educational Administration, and she does hold an MEd (1980) in Curriculum and Instruction, all of which are strengths.  But I do not see her as being able to provide up-to-date teaching in a clinical course.\n\nPUBLICATIONS  …  She had 2 publications in 2006, 1 in 2007, none in 2008 or 2009, and 1 in 2010; 2 are \"in press.\"  To me, this is not at all stellar for someone who has had a PhD for 22 years and who has been in an academic environment for nearly 30.  The titles of some publications suggest they are research-based.  Like her research, her publications also seem to be \"all over the place\" -- faculty turnover, pressure ulcers, academic climate, reimbursement, APRNs, nurse managers, shared governance, etc.\n\nPRESENTATIONS  …  She seems to have been quite active with presentations at national and international conferences in 2010 and has 2 papers accepted for 2011.  All presentations focus on workplace culture/leadership or pressure ulcers.\n\nPROFESSIONAL INVOLVEMENT  …  She has been involved in many university committees/task groups/initiatives, was active (until 1992) in her Sigma Chapter, served as a BON program reviewer in 2004 (nothing more recent), and has provided consultation (but not since 2000).  However, for someone who has been in the field for so long, I see no state or national leadership in professional associations or other similar work.\n\nOverall, while this candidate has a lengthy career and CV, I do not see her as the best fit for our Researcher or our ABSN position.

She is very interested in a faculty position here at DUSON in the FNP program.  She is a Marine Wife, her husband was just transferred to Cherry Point Marine Air Station where he will be stationed for at least 3 years.  She has just left her faculty position and she has been living on base at Cherry Point for 3 days.  She is looking for a full time faculty position and hoping to begin as soon as possible.  She has taught at Uniformed Services University for 2 years and has thoroughly enjoyed the full scope of her faculty role.  She has been involved with the usual committee work (CCNE accreditation), student advisement, and course coordination.  She has taught health assessment, primary care of adults, clinical practicum, and coordinated a cadaver lab with 70 students and several assistant faculty.  She does have some excellent experience in working with high tech patient simulation in teaching health assessment.  We spoke about her limited scholarship - she explained that her DNP research has been accepted and will be published in the very near future.  She shared some ideas for clinically focused articles that she would like to get started on.  She explained that her pubs and presentations have been a little thin over the past two years mainly because she was really getting entrenched in and learning her role as faculty.  She was able to balance her teaching with limited clinic time seeing patients at the Pentagon.  Her past clinial practice experience would be a valuable addition to our FNP ranks.  She was owner of a private FNP practice in rural Maine.  This rural health experience and entrepeneural experience would be a good addition to our faculty as well.  She would like to continue to practice and anticipates doing this perhaps one day per week.  In describing her approach in the classroom, she \"does not bore the students with a lot of power points\", she tends to weave a fair amount of story telling and sharing of her clinical experience into the content.  She describes herself as \"raising the bar high to produce a good NP graduate\" - she mentions that her active duty military students expect a \"good product\" from her as a faculty member also.  Although she is a member in her professional organizations, she has limited leadership.  She does sit on the board of directors for a non-profit that her family operates called Wreaths Across America - one project they perform is to collect donations to fund the distribution of several thousands of wreaths that are placed annually at veteran's cemetaries across the US.  \n\nI think she would be able to hit the ground running, she would full understand what is expected of the greater faculty role, and she would be comfortable in the classroom.  My impression is that she would be a good fit as an FNP faculty member.  I will proceed with reference checks.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"740","CandID":"278","CommenterInitials":"RAA","DateOfComment":"2011-01-21T00:00:00","Comment":"Candidate:      Jiaping Wang                                             \t\t\t Position:  Stat II\nAreas of Evaluation\n\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nHe has not research funding which is appropriate as a new PhD grad (2009) and post-doc (2010-11).

For example, one publication in year 2010, 2008, 2006,… with gaps.  The funding record is not equivalent to what we expect of our faculty at the point of tenure, yet he has had tenure since 2007.  He has been PI on a 5 year HRSA grant which appears to pertain to research of men of color with HIV.  He was also PI on a internally funded grant at UCSF during his post-doc.  He says little about the significance or impact of his work in his letter and it is not apparent in the CV.\n\nB.\tFocused program of research\nHis research is quite focused: his theme is HIV prevention strategies/programs for young men of color as well as developing models of care for those young men who are HIV positive\n\nC.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs\nMany years of experience and leadership in the FNP program at Rochester.  \n\nD.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\nHe is a certified FNP and has been practiced in this role from 1995 to 2009 at which time he likely stopped because of the RWJ Fellowship in DC.

One publication in Statistics & Probability Letters (is that a refereed journal???), one MS accepted for Annual Institute of Statistical Mathematics (is that a refereed journal or an organization’s newsletter?), and several pieces under review, submitted, or “manuscript” (which I assume means it’s being prepared).

She also wants to get her research on track and build a strong program of research related to the intersection of genetics, cardiovascular problems, and aging (which is a unique focus/perspective in the nursing community).\nLong term   She would like to be a “resident expert” in genetics on a faculty, guiding student research, developing and teaching genetics (and research methods) courses or providing leadership in integrating genetics through the curriculum at all levels.  She also aspires to assuming leadership roles in nursing organizations or other organizations (e.g., AHA) to advance genetics initiatives and to create a program in cardiovascular genetics for nurses in practice.\n\nWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nNot applicable\n\nWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nThe candidate has been part of an interdisciplinary group during her training; the importance this group gives to the clinical impact of their work is very much aligned with the candidate’s values, and she would like the opportunity to continue working with this group.  She has already experienced the transition to a more independent role and would like to continue to be an equal, contributing member of the team.  She knows how progressive DUSON has been and is excited about its future.  She believes the DTNI could provide a strong link for her work.  Finally, she is award of the resources to help faculty be innovative and excellent in her teaching and sees that as strength in this environment.\n\nWhat are your strengths?\nThe candidate believes that her training in interdisciplinary models of research to move the science forward is strength.  She has good networking skills and is able to “Broker” collaborations.  She is a perfectionist (e.g., especially careful with data) who is committed to doing science well, and she welcomes (and asks for) feedback and criticism that will help her do good science.  Finally, she believes that there is great potential for her work, and it clearly fits with Duke’s and DUSON’s agendas (e.g., related to health disparities).\n\nWhat are your weaknesses?\nThe candidate expressed an awareness that her publication record is limited; although they were not offered as excuses, she reflected that her diligence often lengthens the data gathering and analysis process and the standards for accepting papers in the journals that are most significant for her work are increasingly high (e.g., expecting a single paper to incorporate multiple dimensions of studying a problem, rather than only one dimension).  She admits that while doing her post-doc she got involved in several projects that were not directly related to her work and realizes that figuring out the balance between being a team player and “protecting one’s time” is a skill that needs to be developed, along with learning how to better prioritize her time and how to negotiate other options when needed.\n\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nThe candidate noted that the thing of which she is most proud is the K-99 funding (she was 1 of only 2 nurses funded through NINR for this program).  Part of her success with this grant was the interdisciplinary perspective she brings and her ability to blend that with her “good science” practices.  “A close second” is the success she had in teaching N307 on her own, a course she completely re-vamped to better engage students and help them value research, not just learn the steps in the research process.\n\nWhat is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online\nThe candidate expressed a desire to have the flexibility to be creative in her teaching to create experiences that help students value and appreciate what they are learning.  She expects high performance from students and expects them to be responsible for their own learning … and she found that students responded positively to this.  She indicated she could teach genetics, research methods, research utilization and, if needed, statistics.  She has a long-term interest in teaching in a PhD program but realizes she will need to be mentored to do that; until then, she would enjoy teaching at the undergraduate or master’s level.  While she does not see herself teaching in the clinical setting (having had no significant practice herself, even though she is an NP), she does envision creating some clinical modules on genetics, working with faculty to incorporate genetics into case studies they develop, and so on.  Finally, while she has recorded some lectures for an online course, she has never had responsibility for an online course and would need mentoring to be successful with that.\n\nWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nHer research interests are noted above – the intersection of genetics, cardiovascular and aging.  She has clear ideas for an evolving program of research and seems well on her way to crystallizing that and moving forward with it.\n\nWhat are your practice interests?\nThe candidate has no goals related to clinical practice.\n\nIssues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nThe Search Committee identified 3 areas needing clarification.  (1) The limited publication record was explained above in terms of the diligence with data before it is reported and the increasing publication standards of relevant journals.  (2)  Her somewhat “erratic” presentation history was explained by a confluence of a series of events (e.g., one mentor leaving the area, another mentor dying, and data being “fried” all of which led to having to get new mentors and craft new projects) and the birth of her first child.  She did note that her most recent presentations have been at competitive, top-notch national conferences, and she fully expects to continue such presentations.  (3)  Her career goals were clearly articulated above.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"758","CandID":"277","CommenterInitials":"TDW","DateOfComment":"2011-02-15T00:00:00","Comment":"Recommend we move forward with references checks on this candidate.\nEleanor Stevenson describes herself as hard-working and goal directed.

This comes after 9 years of balancing school and a number of personal challenges which deterred her from her studies. However, she describes her “passion about her specialty” and “focus on her goals” as the reasons why she has been able to complete this goal. “My retrospective view of this period reflects my accomplishments”.\nShe is currently serving in the role of clinical nurse educator in the ABSN maternity, foundations and synthesis courses. In her role at Duke she has expanded her role from CI working with students in several clinical agencies, to teaching assistant in the maternity course. In this course she participates in lectures, quiz and objective development and student remediation. This role continues to evolve as her collaboration with the lead course instructor to meet the needs of the course increases. She has been involved in teaching at Duke for the past 2 years.\nShe states she “enjoys the caliber of students and finds them a pleasure to work with”. She sees Duke as a place “where education is evolving and her development as a faculty member will be fostered”.\nShe believes she is a clinical expert in the field of maternity and is viewed and respected by students as such.\nHer practice interest is Labor and Delivery. This is the passion behind her research which focuses on the stress in women who conceive through in vitro fertilization.  Her research career is in the “beginning stages”, however she has received some grant funding for a secondary analysis of her data.  \nShe believes her weaknesses are around the fact that “I am very young in my career” and “my educational and research expertise are entry level”.

Record of presentations at conferences (including good national ones) is consistent and strong.  Publication record is weak for someone at this career stage – 1 in 2006, 1 in 2007, 0 in 2008, 2 in 2009 (both of which were conference proceedings), and 3 in 2010 (+ one accepted).\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nScholarly activities documented in CV did not give a clear picture of a focused research agenda – diabetes self-management, older adults, medication adherence, urinary symptoms, heart failure patients, m-learning (whatever that is), Telehealth.  Her letter, however, expresses a desire to continue to develop as a nurse researcher to “further advance nursing knowledge as it relates to prevention and management of chronic illness using various Telehealth modalities.”\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nWould be most interested to know why she resigned from Yale after only 1 year as a Lecturer and 1 as an Associate Professor (most recent position prior to her current work in CA as senior director of clinical practice [whatever that is] for a tech company).  Taught 3 years and coordinated FNP program at U Alabama Birmingham (from which she earned all 3 of her degrees).  Taught 4 years at UVA and 7 at Auburn (where she coordinated an accelerated program).  Seems to have good teaching experiences and has received a teaching excellence award.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nCertified as FNP but not as GNP.  Good clinical practice experience as FNP up to 2006, but no experience since then.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nVery active professional, providing much service.  In fact, much of what she lists under “awards” and “consultation” seems like service to me.  Active and involved.  This is strength.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nHer teaching “stints” seem to be short-lived, and she seems to move around a lot (AL to VA to AL to NC to CT … and now to CA for a non-academic position).  Question the VERY SHORT stay at Yale !!!\n\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nI suppose her research focus is congruent, and I suppose she could teach in the FNP program.  But I am always concerned when a candidate is not clear about what position she wants – almost as if she’s “fishing” for anything, after resigning from Yale and now working in CA (while she lives in AL) for a tech company.  Candidate does not seem focused, and that worries me.  I suggest we get more information before deciding to pursue vigorously.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"777","CandID":"294","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2011-03-07T00:00:00","Comment":"RESEARCH FUNDING & PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  \nExcellent!

Otake.  She is a pleasant woman to speak with.  At times I had a hard time following her responses, found her rambling a little at times, and didn’t directly answer some questions posed of her.  Although English is not her primary language, she spoke English well.  Although she has been in several different departments at the University of Tokyo and had some “variety” there, she is interested in leaving her current position and exploring new opportunities and new cultures.  She is currently faculty at the University of Tokyo; this is where she has obtained all of her graduate and undergraduate education.  The essence of her answer of why she is interested in Duke is the usual answer that there are many resources and opportunities here.  I don’t think I was able to get a clear answer on her interest in the tenure vs. non-tenure track.  When asked what she could teach she noted: health informatics research; basics of informatics; or artificial intelligence research course. She described her general approach in the classroom as somewhat of a problem based learning approach.  She is interested in continuing forward with her program of research in conversation support for cognitive enhancement.  She stated that she currently has funding that could continue with her if she was to leave Univ. of Tokyo.  \nShe did acknowledge that she would need to “get connected” with the community of HEALTH informatics, as that is not a group with which she has interacted much to this point.  She expressed an interest in blending human science, social science and technological science, though she did not clearly explain what that meant or how it might “play out” in her teaching or ongoing research.  \nThe recommendation Terry and I would like to put forth to the committee is for Constance and/or Jane Peace to speak with her specific to the area of informatics.  I think we are both “on the fence” about this candidate.

With PhD completed only in 2009, this is a notable start.  Only 1 presentation at a national meeting and 1 at a regional meeting.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nTo be honest, when I started reading her publications and manuscripts in review and presentations, I did not see a clear focus emerge – caregiving responsibilities, nursing student diversity, use of standardized patients to teach breast exam, self-management activities, obesity, new graduate orientation/mentoring, etc.  However, as I read further (including her letter), her program of research is now quite clear – the impact of caregiving on self-management activities & diabetic health of African American grandmothers.  This seems to have good potential for funding, extended work, and interprofessional collaboration.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nShe taught only 1 year as an adjunct at UNC Pembroke and 2 years as an Assistant Professor at Winston-Salem.  This is quite limited.  Additionally, it’s not clear what her teaching expertise is since the “courses taught” listed range from adult acute care, graduate health assessment, research methods, community/ public health, foundations, and gerontology.  She has taught in online and on-campus environments.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nSeveral clinical positions over a 10-year period (geropsych, cardiology, bariatric surgery, student/employee health).  Since many were short-term, I question a focused area of specialty development which would be of concern if she were applying for a teaching position in the ABSN program; it is not a concern for a researcher position applicant.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nHolds membership in several associations and served as chair of an STTI chapter committee and President of the Little Rock chapter of the NBNA.  Serves as a reviewer for several respected journals and on the Communications Advisory Board of BAGNC.  Served on research & scholarship committees in the schools where she taught.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nMost of her clinical positions were for 1-3 year “stints” with 1 position being 4 years.  Her positions since moving out of clinical also have been short.  This raises concern for me about job stability.\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nWould seem to be a good match with interests that complement current work.  I’m not sure what she would teach that is not already “covered,” but I suppose something would be found.  Her own diversity and her scholarly focus on a minority population are aligned with DUSON’s focus.

Long term, I want to establish myself in the field through my research, while maintaining a teaching role, particularly with MSN and doctoral students.\n\nWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\n\nI want to expand myself … learn new skills, and learn how to be effective in a new environment.  I also want to become more skilled in integrating technology into my teaching and do not have many resources to do that where I am now.  Also, the supports here at DUSON for developing as a teacher and researcher are wonderful and not available at my current school.\n\nWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \n\nTeaching at Duke has been my dream for a long time.  I see it as the “mecca” of teaching.  The graduates are good and the school prides itself on excellence.  I want to be part of that kind of an environment.\n\nWhat are your strengths?\n \nI establish good “connections” with learners … being able to assess their needs and mentor them.  I strive for excellence.  I am comfortable with the academic environment (e.g., committee work).  And I believe my research is breaking “new ground” and has great potential to make important contributions to our understanding of the needs of grandparents who are providing care.\n\nWhat are your weaknesses?\n\nI will need support to continue to develop my research skills.\n\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\n\nI am very proud of having received a Hartford pre-doc award and a post-doc award.  I also am very proud of my military experience and how it helped me grow.\n\nWhat is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online\n\nI would be most excited about teaching community health and nursing research, and I would enjoy mentoring capstone projects.  I taught in the MSN program at Arkansas and would enjoy working with those students.  And I don’t mind teaching online.\n\nWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\n\nI am most interested in the needs of grandmothers who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren, particularly in the African-American population.  I plan to retain this focus and expand it to focus on interventions that meet the needs of this population, hopefully through NIH funding.\n\nWhat are your practice interests?\n\nI would like to “stay connected” to the care of patients with diabetes.  I am preparing to sit for the acute care NP certification exam.  [No specific plans related to practice were described.]\n\nIssues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nThe one issue I had raised when reviewing her CV related to what seemed to be some lack of focus in her research … at least initially.  That “concern” was addressed by the time I finished my review of her CV, and the clarity of her research interests were strengthened during this conversation.  I had also raised a question about her apparent lack of “job stability,” but she explained why those “short stints” occurred.\n\nNOTE  …  Dana told me that she recently won the university’s research award  from Winston-Salem State University.  I suggested she update her CV to include that award.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"810","CandID":"312","CommenterInitials":"tdw","DateOfComment":"2011-05-27T00:00:00","Comment":"Recommendation: I would recommend a phone screen only because she has some qualities I would like to see in community health faculty candidate, she is being support so she is perceived as a viable candidate in the community, and there are some gaps in information I would like to see explored.\n\nCandidate:           Jill Kerr                                        \t\t\t Position:  ABSN Community Health \n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nShe has 1 pub in press and a few others.

Below is a summary of our discussion.  In short I would recommend reference checks and, if there are no red flags, further recommend a campus visit.\n\nA.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\nHer short term goals are to come to DUSON as a tenure track faculty member.\nLong term goals are to expand her area of research working with multidisciplinary teams and to grow as an educator. \n\nB.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nShe is currently in a research track position which is very independent.  She is ready to more to a position with more teaching and academic focus.  Currently in more of a service driven position without the feel of a larger academic mission.  She would like to have more student involvement in her work.  She would like to have more teaching and academic responsibilities.  There is also no informatics program where she is and would like to be involved with one.\n\nC.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nShe is familiar with many scientists here at Duke.  She knows Dr. Constance Johnson and some people at DCRI.  She was on campus a few months ago and has collaborated with people in DCRI.  She was very excited following the visit.  She was most impressed by the work people were doing here as well as with the vibrant academic and scholarly environment.\n\nD.\tWhat are your strengths?\nShe is very good at working in multidisciplinary teams.  She works as a very good bridge between disciplines and finds linkages.  She referred to herself as somewhat of a ringleader when working in groups to solve problems.  She describes herself as very approachable.  She is able to easily see big picture connections.  She enjoys writing papers to get groups of diverse people (disciplines) together.\n\nE.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nDelegating work is a challenge for her.  She thinks everyone is very busy and should she burden others with work she is capable of doing herself.  She has a hard time giving up work to others but is consciously working on this.\n\nF.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nShe believes the grants she has written in the past, whether funded or not, have been her greatest accomplishments.  She has become “competent” in writing grants through this process.  She feels she has grown in her ability to write grants.\n\nG.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\nAlthough she is not an expert educator, she enjoys teaching.  She has taught a few classes in informatics and has lectured at several conferences.  She feels that she over prepares for classes (she jokingly states that she doesn’t want the students to know that she doesn’t know everything).  She describes her approach in the classroom as starting with the “big picture” and painting a broad picture of the problem.  She feels laying out a solid background is important for the students.  She is good at organizing her classes and picking appropriate readings.  She feels her lectures are very “follow-able” but does state that she has some weakness in engaging students in activities and would like to work on that since she finds the student engagement very important.\n\nH.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nResearch interests are in identifying and evaluating research standards as well as investigating methods and approaches to using research (data) standards and control terminology.  She is interested in applications to real world problems.  She would like to build and evaluate tools for multidisciplinary research.\n\nI.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nN/A\n\nJ.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nN/A","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"815","CandID":"311","CommenterInitials":"RAA","DateOfComment":"2011-06-03T00:00:00","Comment":"A.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nShe is a new DNP graduate.

(If they are currently in a position)\nI am doing well where I am.  I’m on the tenure track and carry a workload of 40% teaching (which equates to 15 credits between the fall and spring semesters), 40% research, and 20% service.

Students say I am inspirational.  I set high standards for students and believe in them to reach those standards.  I am a good listener, conscientious, and an effective team member.  I also seek advice from my chair and senior faculty, and I respond well to feedback.  I also am able to remain calm in the face of problems [and described a situation that happened in a classroom recently].  Also, having been born and grown up in South Korea, I bring a bi-cultural perspective to my students and colleagues.\n\nWhat are your weaknesses?\nBecause English is not my native language and I want to be correct in speaking, I sometimes speak a bit slowly, and the students sometimes complain about this … but I’m getting better.  Sometimes the acculturation challenges make it hard for me to understand student behavior, student/teacher relationships and other things in the US … but that’s when I seek advice and guidance.\n\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nI am pleased that I completed a PhD in my 2nd language … and that I was able to balance raising a family at the same time.\n\nWhat is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online\nAll of my teaching to date has been with undergraduate students – traditional BSN, accelerated BSN, and RN-to-BSN – and I enjoy that … though I expect I would enjoy teaching graduate students, too.  My research courses have enrolled 40-60 students, I taught a health promotion course online, and I taught 1 clinical group in a Fundamentals course (but no other clinical teaching).\n\nWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nMy dissertation focused on gender differences in MI patients, but I have since shifted my focus to the use of technology to help older adults manage their heart failure or other C-V problems.  I want to continue to work with heart failure patients and helping them self-monitor – possibly using iPhones, iPads and the like – to manage their health problems.  I also am interested in prevention measures related to C-V status for college-age students.\n\nWhat are your practice interests?\nI am in the primary care ANP program at DUSON and hope to work with adults who are post-MI, have HTN, or have other C-V problems to prevent future problems and manage current ones.\n\nIssues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nIf I were to be appointed to this position and the course focused largely on acute care issues, I would need to engage in some acute care practice before teaching the course in order to update myself.  I would be comfortable teaching Pharm, Patho and similar foundational concepts (particularly since I’m studying those areas in my PMC program).  I taught acute care Adult Health in Korea for 4 years and was most comfortable with that, and the residency I completed in Iowa in 2006 (which occurred after receiving my RN license in the US) gave me good experiences in caring for patients with C-V problems.\n\nComments from the Interviewer\nJu Young was wonderful at remembering the questions I had asked and cycling back to them after the conversation may have drifted in a slightly different direction.  I did not have to work hard to keep her focused.\n\nShe also asked if there would be a conflict with being appointed if she were still a student in the PMC program.  She does not plan to finish that program until May 2012.  I told her I did not know and that would be a question we would have to discuss with the committee and the dean.\n\nShe does speak a bit slowly, but her English is very good.\n\nI recommend we contact references or – if that is no longer part of our process at this point – bring her in for an interview.  Although her acute care experience is a bit limited, she is more than dedicated to doing what she needs to do to get back “up to speed,” and I got the impression that this is a woman who does whatever she sets her mind to do.\n\nBy the way … Although she sounded a bit disappointed, she did say that she was still interested in the position, even though it's on the Practice Track.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"822","CandID":"315","CommenterInitials":"TDW","DateOfComment":"2011-06-23T00:00:00","Comment":"Candidate:     Kathleen Quinn                                              \t\t\t Position:  ABSN Community\nRecommendation- Recommend that committee.

She also has a strong record of presentations at national/international conferences, again ones that seem most appropriate to her research work.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nVery clear about her program of research  …  “conduct cutting edge physiological investigations of clinical phenomena in critically ill children” particularly focusing on “the interplay of the GI immune system, transplantation and nutrition in children.  Has been mentored by Dr. Margaret Heitkemper, which is impressive.  Her cover letter provides extensive information about her research trajectory and suggests great passion for this work.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nHer CV lists 3 years as a “Clinical Assistant Professor” at UDUB, but it’s not clear what that means.  She does not indicate any courses that she taught, and page 1 of her CV clearly lists Seattle Children’s Hospital as her employer (i.e., she makes no mention there of this teaching position).  Additionally, in her letter, she expresses no interest in teaching, other than a brief mention (in the last paragraph) about “valuing the opportunity to be an active participant in coordinating student projects and providing thesis and dissertation advisement.”  It seems clear to me that she has no interest in taking responsibility for a course or contributing in any significant way to the teaching needs of DUSON.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nCertified as ARNP in Peds and currently works as (1) a PNP at children’s Hospital in Seattle and (2) a per deim RN in the PICU at Swedish Medical Center, also in Seattle.  Her research is clinically focused.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nShe lists membership in several organizations but indicates no involvement in them.  Under “Professional Membership” she indicate that she is a member of the research team for PIFCon, but this sounds like a national  research coalition, not any kind of professional organization.  I could be wrong, though … I don’t know what PIFCon is.  \n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \n\nI have some questions here.  She lists 2 1-year positions, 1 2-year job, and 3 jobs that she has been doing since 2004 or 2005.  I would assume that none of these are full-time, so I would wonder about her ability to make a commitment to an organization and help it move forward … not just advance her own research, but help the entire organization meet its goals and advance?\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nThe DB indicates she is interested in a Researcher position.  If that’s true, then I think she’s a great candidate and would bring a unique perspective to our faculty with her focus on physiological research.  Her letter, however, indicates she is applying for a Tenure Track position.  In this case, I would be concerned about her lack of teaching and lack of professional involvement, as well as wonder about her organizational commitment.  I recommend a phone interview (a) to clarify the position in which she is interested and (b) clarify the questions about teaching and job stability.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"837","CandID":"315","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2011-07-08T00:00:00","Comment":"RESEARCH FUNDING & PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  \nCV lists no research activity or funding, and no grant funding.  For someone who has had her doctorate for 18 years, her scholarship is very limited.  She lists 1 refereed article but indicates it was submitted in August 2010 … was it published???  She lists 5 abstracts, 3 of which are “submitted (2010, 2009, and 2008), and 2 of which were presented … 1 in 2008 and 1 in 2009.  Her journal articles (6 listed) indicate 3 were submitted (all in 2008!), 1 was accepted in 2008 (but was it published???), 1 published in a book in 2008 (a 1-page contribution!), 1 in 2006, and 1 in 2005.  By the way, several of her posters and articles focused on administration issues, and I saw nothing related to community health.  I found all of this to be most confusing, and I read it as her not being concerned enough to make sure her CV was up to date.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nThere is no program of research indicate, and no plans to develop and pursue one.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nShe apparently is quite skilled in curriculum development, which is a plus, and she does hold an EdD which is in Marriage & Family Counseling; I would assume this included an emphasis on teaching/learning, curriculum, and so on, but it has no focus on nursing.  For the past 6 months she has been an adjunct professor at Duquesne, supervising DNP capstone projects, and chair of the department of nursing education at a small university in VA.  Prior to that she spent 2 years developing the curriculum at the College of Coastal GA, and the 2 years prior to that were spend doing 2 jobs … teaching at LSU and serving as an administrator at a Psychotherapy center.  She spent 3 years as “faculty” at the LSU Law Enforcement CE department.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nAs Chief Health Officer and CEO at the Psychotherapy center, she provided direct patient care in a clinic (patient focus seems to be women’s health) in addition to all her administrative responsibilities.  She lists 2 years as “Preceptorship-Women’s Health NP” at Vanderbilt & Women’s Health Center, but it looks like this would have been the time she was an MSN student at Vanderbilt.  I am not clear how she would have been able to “act at a preceptor in the high risk OB clinic performing administrative & management functions when the NP was unavailable.”  I do not see any community health experience, she says she holds APN certification in several states but does not indicate the specialty (though I would assume it’s women’s health), and I see no other clinical practice experience.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nI see no active involvement – or even membership! – in professional organizations.  Am I missing that?  She has had nice state appointments and been active at that level, but nothing in the nursing profession.\n\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nI have some concerns here.  Other than a 17-year stint as Executive Director for the National Sexual Trauma Center, I see no positions lasting more than 2 years.  This ED appointment is nice, but I wonder how someone can be the lead on-the-ground person for a national organization and hold  all those other positions at the same time.  \n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nI have major concerns about this candidate and recommend we not pursue her.  I see no preparation, practice, or expertise in community health (though she has taught this kind of course now and then).  I see no scholarly activity or significant professional involvement, and I think her clinical practice is weak.  I am concerned about job stability.  Although she seems to have expertise in and passion for curriculum work, her teaching experiences are somewhat limited.  And finally, I must admit to being concerned about (a) the confusion and seemingly not-up-to-date nature of her CV, and (b) her seeming lack of focus (she has degrees in guidance/counseling, religious education, theology, nursing, marriage & family counseling … her publications [limited though they are] address women’s health, administration issues, and education).","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"838","CandID":"321","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2011-07-08T00:00:00","Comment":"RESEARCH FUNDING & PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  \nThe CV lists no research completed (not even her dissertation!) and no funding or even grant submissions.  She lists 2 submitted and 1 in press articles related to the RO1 grant from which her dissertation evolved (she is 1st author on the “in press” manuscript).  She has a 2010 article (8th author) in Issues in Mental Health Nursing, also related to the RO1 project/dissertation work, and 6 others (refereed and non-refereed, published between 2000 and 2007) that focus on cancer care.  Her poster and podium presentations are largely local or regional, and all but the 1 in 2010 (which, again relates to the RO1/dissertation) focus on cancer care. She notes no podium presentations since 2008, but she probably was in her PhD program during those years.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nFor someone who is applying for a Researcher position, I was sorely disappointed that she did not outline ideas related to her program of research.  All she said in her cover letter was “my own program of oncology and end-of-life research.”  I see no thinking related to questions she wants to study, potential sources of funding, interprofessional research teams she might want to create, etc.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nShe certainly has done patient and staff teaching as a CNS, but her only “academic” experience was as a TA, and that’s mentioned only in her letter.  It seems she would be starting from “ground zero” in terms of teaching and the faculty role.  Even though she is interested in a Researcher position, all faculty are expected to teach and provide service; she would need extensive mentoring for this part of her responsibilities.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nShe has extensive clinical experience related to cancer care … 20 years as a staff nurse or CNS and 2 years as a nursing supervisor.  She documents no clinical work since 2009, but that was when she was in her PhD program.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nThe candidate documents active involvement in professional organizations that “match” her clinical practice area.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nThis is not of concern to me.

Although her PhD is new, she documents no research activities, no grant writing, etc.  More concerning, however, is that she expresses no specific direction for her own research agenda.  Her dissertation seemed to take her into an area that is not her expertise or passion, and her reasons for doing that make sense.  But I wonder what her research aims are related to her “own program of oncology and end-of-life research.”  As stated above, I see no thinking related to questions she wants to study, potential sources of funding, interprofessional research teams she might want to create, etc., and this concerns me for someone interested in a Researcher position.  I am inclined to say “No” to this candidate, but I would not argue strongly against a phone interview.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"839","CandID":"324","CommenterInitials":"SD","DateOfComment":"2011-07-14T00:00:00","Comment":"Areas of Evaluation\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\n•\tNo\n•\tThis candidate received her PhD in Educational Research/Evaluation in 2002.

She indicates she has been an Assistant Professor at Wayne State in the College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences for 10 years, but she has been only an “adjunct faculty” in their Graduate Program of Nurse Anesthesiology (since 1999).  What does this mean?  What does she do in the NURSE Anesthesia program?  Under “select professional presentations-seminar lecture topics,” she lists about 20 topics … are these guest lectures she has given in Nursing?  None of these “professional presentations” indicate any conference, so I’m assuming they are all seminar lecture topics.

In school of public health, I teach face-to face, conduct webinars and in class training courses. I have high standards in my training classes.

She hopes to remain clinically active, at least on a part-time basis, throughout her teaching career.\n\nWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nDr. Carman recently signed an agreement with DUSON’s ABSN program to be a full-time Clinical Associate for 1 year, teaching foundations (with Beth Phillips) in the fall and adult health (with Lisa Day?) in the spring.  She wants to get into a FT teaching role and would hope to be able to transition to that, should she be offered a FT position and provided such an appointment would not leave the ABSN program “short” [my word, not hers].  She seems ethically committed to fulfilling her responsibility this year, though she would love to be FT.\n\nWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nShe has a strong connection to Duke, likes large learning institutions (she “grew up” at Yale), and sees this as a great “fit” for her.  She is local and devoted to the community.  She likes the emphasis on science in DUSON’s mission and philosophy, and she is excited about opportunities to work collaboratively with the SOM, PT and others, asserting that we must eliminate the silos that have characterized health professions fields and practice.\n\nWhat are your strengths?\nIndependence, lifelong learner, often chooses the uphill road (rather than the easy way out), looks for new challenges, leads by example (especially with students), willing to try new things, supports and encourages others.\n\nWhat are your weaknesses?\n“Sometimes I’m a bit of a pushover” meaning I sometimes take on more than I should and don’t push others to take on their own responsibilities.  I can be stubborn, and I sometimes blame myself too much.”\n\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\n“Personally, it’s my children, ages 25, 22 and 8.  Professionally, I’ve come a long way locally and nationally in establishing the role of NPs in the ED; much of this work has been done through ENA.”\n\nWhat is your teaching passion?  …  Class size  …  Clinical groups  …  Online\nThe ideal would be a class of about 15 students, small group discussion of issues, connecting clinical experiences to classroom and lab.  She would love to teach ED care, and she’d be interested in incorporating online learning with face-to-face learning.  She understands that the ABSN program has large classes, and thinks she can manage that, but smaller groups (particularly in an MSN program) would be her ideal.\n\nWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nDr. Carman says she is interested in looking more at pursuing evidence-based programs and leading nurses (e.g., in free-standing Eds) in how to approach problems and improve practice, using evidence.\n\nWhat are your practice interests?\nAs noted above, the candidate would like to remain clinical active (at least on a PT) basis throughout her teaching career.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"868","CandID":"337","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2011-08-19T00:00:00","Comment":"Research funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above\nNo significant funding record (last grant ended in 2003 and there is no indication of grant submission since then).

First of all, she did not bother preparing any kind of cover letter to tell us about her, her experiences, her passions, her goals, etc.  Second, the only reason she notes in her e-mail message is that she is “looking to re-locate to the southeast” … this says nothing about her interest in DUSON or that she even bothered to find out about anything we do.  Finally, I am concerned about what she says on page 1 of her CV in terms of her career objective …  “To study and provide effective evidence-based and humanistic care to individuals suffering from the dual disorders of addition and pain, and their families, with the goal of promoting optimal functionality and ongoing recovery.”  This is a most laudable career objective, but it gives no indication of her interest in leadership in education.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"870","CandID":"333","CommenterInitials":"CB","DateOfComment":"2011-08-20T00:00:00","Comment":"A.\tResearch funding and publication productivity --- tenure track eligible—Associate or above\nApplicant identifies area of research interest as decision making, cognitive processes, and self-management in chronic illness.

She states, “My own scholarly activity has been persistent, but my research has been subject to periods without substantial funding until more recent years. My dissertation and subsequent research examined the leadership behaviors of leaders in key organizational positions and leader/follower behaviors and expectations in academic and healthcare organizations. As would be expected, funding for these studies was sparse, since the findings were neither outcome focused nor translational in nature.” Has gap between 1998 and 2010.\nHer record of publication is also limited with only 5 first authored pubs since 2001. Publications also demonstrate the gap \nShe was VP of operations from 2001-2009 which may be why her scholarship demonstrates inconsistency\n\nB.\tProgressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.\n\nHer CV demonstrates she has experience with faculty, student and staff constituencies similar Duke in size and scope of responsibility.  She has served on several university based committees as well as school of nursing committees.  Her CV highlights activities or accomplishments related to her role as ADAA. These involve designing and revising RN/BSN AMSN, and doctoral programs. She also was instrumental in design, reorganizing and restructuring learning resources (learning lab, computer lab, interactive televelsion classroom). \t\n\nC.\tExperience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)\n1.\tResearch\nCV demonstrates lack of substantial extramural funding.

She has done a number of book reviews and presentations at national conferences. She has also served as chair on capstone, dissertation and master thesis committees.  Not sure if I missed it but oddly enough she has not be recognized for teaching excellence. \n\n3. Professional Service\nShe is Deputy Director of Nursing for NIOSH 2011. Active in national, local and university level committees in service roles. She has also served as a consultant supporting leaderships and shared governance implementation. She is also a CCNE and NLN program evaluator\n\nD.\tPotential to be a thought leader\nShe says she was an early adopter of instructional technology, she was a key player in an entrepreneurial business venture and a facilitator and implementation consultant for shared governance models in hospital.

Has had faculty position at Yale.  \n\nA.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\nShort term:  wants to continue to develop program of research.  While in academia over the past 20 years she has had a good program of scholarship (HRSA grants, publications) but did not have intensive research program.  So she went back to school after being in academia for 20 years and completed a post doc at UNC-CH in chronic illness. .\nInterested in conducting research, teaching at the doctoral level.  In particular very interested in DNP teaching given the significant background as NP and NP educator. \n\nLong term:  Develop a program of research.  Emphasis on use of telemedicine to deliver interventions for chronic illness elderly populations.   Wants a position where she has some stability.  Her husband died while she was at UVA. Thus she had to move around several times for personal reasons. \n\nB.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\n-was in academia for 25 plus years. \n-presently in a corporate position that came out of her research.  Last faculty position at Yale SON. Was doing a pilot study there using iPhones.  The company that lent the iPhones and funded the study offered her a corporate position.  This position allowed her the flexibility to be at home in Alabama with new husband. \n\n Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \n\nReputation.  Has been in academia at top tier schools.  Wants to continue this.  While doing post doc at UNC-CH she met several DUSON faculty and was very impressed with the work we are doing.  Met and spoke with Ellie McConnel at one of the GSA conferences.  Was very impressed with her. \nInterested in working in a school that is rich in gerontology.\nLikes the location near the research triangle. \n\nC.\tWhat are your strengths?\nTeam player. While much of the successful work in academia is done individually, she really enjoys working with as  a team.  Has an excellent work ethic.  Was invited/nominated as a fellow in the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.   Strong communication skills. \n\nD.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nHas a tendency to initially see the positive/good in everyone and sees them as passionate about roles and responsibilities as she is.  Has learned from instances when this has not worked out.  Wishes she had a keener eye at picking this up so that expectations are not dashed. \n\nE.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nBeing nominated as a fellow in the AANP.  It recognized her passion, expertise for advanced practice nursing\n\nF.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\nFavorite or preference is to teach in seminar style. Feels she is highly effective in a setting with a smaller group of students (10-12).   But she has taught in a range of class size.  Really likes to teach on chronic illnesses.  Likes to teach about roles and professional obligations given her extensive experience as NP .  \n•\tClass size\n•\tClinical groups\n•\tOnline:  has taught both synchronous and asynchronous.  This type of teaching fits well with her area of research interest in telemedicine. \nG.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nJust completed a pilot using the iPhone 4 with older adults with diabetes.  Wants to expand sample size and repeat with a chronic illness group.  Would like to experiment with another type of telemedicine.   What is the most feasible telemedicine approach to use with older adults with chronic illness? \nIs interested in writing a K award.  Or an R award.   Needs research mentorship.\n\nH.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nYes.  Is interested in some level of practice.  Most recently participated on a voluntary basis in a clinic. \n\nI.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nHas worked at 4 SONS since 1991:  Yale (2 years); UAB (3 years); UV (4 years);  Auburn (3 years).  She is a widower. Thus she moved several times as a result of personal reasons. Remarried a couple of years ago.  New husband has a business in Alabama and was not able to sell it at the time.

Candidate is known to us and is local. She was very personable and easy to talk to. She demonstrates strong clinical expertise and the ability to teach which is supported by course work and effectiveness in her role as a clinical associate teaching part-time. Her lack of scholarship and recent change of capstone topic,  without presentation of capstone proposal, is very concerning to me. I think the level of her presentation will confirm or eliminate my questions about her ability to serve and maintain a faculty position.\nAllison Walp Dimsdale\nWhat are your goals for a faculty position? \nI am currently working as a clinical associate at Duke. I am doing some part-time teaching and have served as a preceptor. I would like to teach part-time and maintain clinical practice part-time. I will be open for discussion regarding % and the way I can maintain my practice and teaching balance. Practice is very important to me. The deal breaker would be if I had to completely give up my practice\nWhy duke??\nI am Duke born and bred. I am 5th generation Duke in my family. I am totally committed to Duke. I never considered anything else for working or going to school. My daughter is a student at Duke now. It seems like a natural progression.\nWhat are your strengths? \nMy people skills are my strength. I am a good communicator and I know how to get my point across. I enjoy teaching students. In the ACLS classes I teach. I always end up with those who are struggling to succeed. It is rewarding for me help students figure out how to learn. I am very comfortable with lecture and like to find creative ways to teach. \nWhat are you weaknesses? \nPublishing is my weakness. I want to improve in this area and have identified DUSON mentors to support me.\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment? \nMy most significant accomplishment is the relationships I have established with my clients. When they feel like the can call me and I can help them, I am pleased with myself. I am also proud of the project I am working on with Dr. Fulkerson and a team to redesign practice for nursing in a cardiology clinic.\n1 year ago based on the IOM recommendations, we restructured work in the clinic so nurses were positioned to manage direct patient care, NPs were placed in the role of the provider  for established patients and MD’s are only seeing new admissions. The clinical changed from the more physician directed care model. It has been very successful. \n\nWhat is your teaching passion? \nI like working with students who are challenged and need that remediation. I am drawn to them.\nI took Dr. Edwards education course this past summer. They were great course.\nWhat are your practice interests? \nMy passion is Cardiology nursing. I am interested I patients who have ICD’s and their risk for anxiety. I have a desired to educate this population. My daughter has an ICD so is it a topic which is personal. \nFuture research\nOriginally, I was going to do my capstone looking at anxiety risk in patients with an ICD. I just changed my capstone focus yesterday (September 21, 2011) to look at the changes in quality of care based on our practice redesign. I have the data and I think it is effective. After speak with my advisor we thought this was the best option. I have not done my capstone proposal defense, but don’t think that will take much time. I expect to walk in May and finish my DNP in August.\nWhat contributions would you make to DUSON? \nI am a people person so I think I will bring my energy, my passion for caring for others and my experience as a clinician.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"906","CandID":"347","CommenterInitials":"TDW","DateOfComment":"2011-09-22T00:00:00","Comment":"CONFIDENTIAL\nFaculty Search Committee\nReviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nRecommendation: Phone Screen\nCandidate:         Diane Kelly                                          \t\t Position:  Health Policy\n\nAreas of Evaluation\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\n\nHer research funding and scholarly productivity are limited for her career stage.

She has a consistent record of peer-reviewed publications, several of which are data-based; 2 data-based articles are in press.  She has many published abstracts, most of which are in the journal Circulation but none of which are more recent than 2000.  She has received extensive funding from the Maryland Higher Education Commission to complete projects related to faculty (workforce, development, etc.) and in recent years has 1 HRSA program grant and 1 GAANN project funded by USDOE, both of which focus on educators.  Other than this focus, it is difficult to see a pattern in her funded projects as they range from breast health to immunization, quality of life in adults over 60, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, agricultural hazards, diverse populations, and cancer screening.  Prior to this “collection” of foci, her funded projects primarily addressed cardiac problems.  She has a consistent record of presentations at national conferences including, the NIH Health Disparities Conference, CANS, NLN, Association of Standardized Patient Educators, SNRS, and International Meeting on Medical Simulation.\n\nProgressive academic administration experience (prior roles and span of control) including evidence of roles involving interaction with university administrators outside of nursing, and experience in managing and/or oversight of major constituencies (faculty, staff, students) and organizational structures and systems.\n\nThis candidate served as acting director (for 1 year) and director (for 5 years) of graduate studies at Maryland, and 1 year as acting director of research there.  In more recent years, she has been co-director or director of the standardized patients lab, teaching in nursing and health professions post-graduate certificate program, and institute for educators in nursing and health professions.  Her CV documents no responsibility as department chair, associate dean, or other academic administrative position, though her letter (page 2) speaks to her being director of “these programs.”  The letter does note her role in developing an RN-to-MS program, a revised PhD curriculum, obtaining preliminary accreditation for the Nurse Midwifery specialty, and involvement in writing reports for accreditation or other external reviews.  One would assume that she needed to interact with many individuals to bring these initiatives to life, but I am not sure I see evidence of “managing or overseeing major constituencies and organizational structures/systems.”  This would be an area to explore during a phone interview.\n\nExperience in each of the school’s missions (research, teaching, professional service)\n\n1. Research\nThis candidate’s expertise in measurement and patient outcomes led to her being invited to serve on the planning committee for 2 large clinical trials sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, both of which are reported (in her letter) to have become “landmark studies that dramatically impacted care of patients with lethal arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation.”  She was selected as a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Nurse Scholar in 1985-87 and completed that post-doctoral fellowship at UCSF.  See comments above as well.\n\n2. Teaching\nTeaches graduate courses in instructional strategies, assessment of learning, measurement of nursing phenomena, teaching practicum, and special topics in nursing education.  Also serves on dissertation committees as chair, member and consultant; and chairs/serves on thesis committees.  She also has received awards for excellence in teaching/education.\n\n3. Professional Service\nA most active, involved professional and “citizen of the academy.”  Serves on national committees, editorial boards and review panels, and is a consultant.\n\nPotential to be a thought leader\n\nThis candidate would seem to have the potential to be a thought leader in nursing education, particularly in relation to faculty development, faculty workforce, educational innovations, simulation, the use of standardized patients, measurement, and program outcomes.\n\nPotential as a coordinator and team builder in complex organizations\n\nMany of her publications are jointly authored, as are several of her funded projects.  This combined with her success in professional association work leads one to conclude that she can coordinate and build teams, and her experience at the U of Maryland leads one to assume she can do this in a complex organization.\n\nJob stability\n\nNo concerns here … she has been at U Maryland since 1996 and was at U Wisconsin-Milwaukee for nearly 10 years before that.\n\nSummary of potential contribution/match to DUSON\n\nCandidate has many strengths, but also has some weaknesses as noted above.

She currently is the co-PI on 1 R01, PI on another R01, and has yet another R01 (for which she would be the PI) under review.  Since 2000, she has more than 50 data-based publications in prestigious journals; most of her publications have been done in collaboration with colleagues, and she is first author on 10 of them.  Additionally, she is 3rd author (with Patricia Benner and Chris Tanner) on a book on Expertise in Nursing Practice: Caring, Clinical Judgment and Ethics, which is in its 2nd edition and has been translated to Swedish and German.  She has a consistent record of invited presentations at international conferences, including the International Congress on Qualitative Inquiry, the International Family Nursing Conference, and the International Nursing Research Congress on Evidence-based Practice.  At the national level, she has presented at the APA conference, State of Science Congress, and Asian American Center on Health Disparities Research conference, among others.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nThis candidate received her DNSc in 1998 and completed a post-doc at UCSF in the following year.  Since then, she has had a sustained and impressive program of research that shifted over the years “from interpretive studies of family skills and practices, to multidisciplinary multi-method investigations of family factors influencing outcomes in type 2 diabetes, to current work in conducting a clinical trial.”  The central aim of her research is to interpret individual and family experiences with chronic illness so naturalistic interventions can be developed.  Her research, as she notes, has always been community based but has become increasingly community-engaged.  \n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nThis is an experiences teacher, whose primary focus in recent years is with doctoral students.  Most recently she is teaching Qualitative Research Methods and Interpretive Phenomenology, both of which align with the approaches she uses in her own research.  She seems to take her responsibility as a senior faculty member very seriously in terms of mentoring doctoral students and faculty colleagues, and she received the Excellence in Teaching Award for Research Mentoring from UCSF SON in 2011.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nHer “practice” is her research.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nThis candidate is actively involved in professional associations that “match” her scholarly work; among her contributions are service as chair of the strategic planning group and member of the Board of the International Family Nursing Association, and service on the Fellows Selection Committee of the AAN.  She has a long history of service as a manuscript reviewer (currently doing this for 3 journals that are aligned with her areas of scholarship), as well as a member of the Editorial Board of another journal, and a consulting editor for yet another.  The candidate has been a consultant to various schools of nursing (including DUSON) and is a visiting faculty at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.  She is a good “citizen of the academy” at the system, campus, school and department levels, serving on (among others) departmental peer review committees and the UCSF Committee on Academic Freedom.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nNo concerns here … She has been at UCSF since 1988.\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nShe was inducted into the AAN in 2003 and awarded an endowed chair  in ethics and spirituality in 2008.  This is an experienced researcher, teacher, and professional leader who would be an asset to DUSON in many ways.  She expresses an interest in “connecting” with OGACHI and DTNI, both of which offer exciting opportunities for her and for us.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"922","CandID":"354","CommenterInitials":"TDW","DateOfComment":"2011-10-05T00:00:00","Comment":"RECOMMENDATION: I recommend a campus visit\n\nWhat are your goals for a faculty position? \nI am in interested in pursuing a nursing research career which will include teaching,  and looking for something that has devoted research time but provide an environment where I could interact with students who are going to be working in practice.\nWhy duke??\nDuke is respected for research and a center for nursing development which is also on the forefront of teaching. I am also looking for a place that has some individuals who can mentor me as I grow as a researcher and teacher.\nBecause of the reputation of Duke and the fact that Duke is cultivating a research environment is important to me. Also the goals towards grantsmanship at Duke. My PhD is not nursing but interdisciplinary so the Duke interdisciplinary link is intriguing. It was not implied but talked explicated in the mission.\nI also met a scholar from the psychology department at Duke who spoke highly of the school of nursing.\nCan you explain what an Interdisciplinary PhD is??\nIn this program you have to have to make a case for why your research questions require more than one discipline to answer when you apply. It is very focused on interdisciplinary approaches to answering research questions.  The committee is interdisciplinary (mine was a psychologist and 2 nurses and a MD). It is to get a perspective on the value of all disciplines\nIt has strong informal and formal approach to scientific inquiry using qualitative and quantitative methods. I was required to look at mixed methods in as my comprehensive project doing a pilot and a literature synthesis. The PhD has broadened my horizons which allowed me to look at the value of other discipline.\nWhat are your strengths? \nI am very inquisitive and very passionate about nursing. I am tenacious when it comes to work ethic. I have an appreciation for both qualitative and quantitative methods which gives me the ability to bridge these things together. I am very well rounded clinically and I have always had a clinical role.  I think questions which intrigue me the most are practice driven. \nI moved overseas to work as a nurse and do research in under developed countries, so I have experience in global health perspectives\n\nWhat are your weaknesses? \nI would have to say in the role as a formal educator. I have done some clinical teaching which has gone very well. My personality meshes will with students but course development and learning methods and leading a course I will need help with. I will be teaching research methods for the University in the spring of 2012 and this will give me my first lived experience in formal education.\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment? \nThe research I undertook in my dissertation. Acknowledging how pain affects the lives of children and being at the forefront on how pain is affecting social functioning on the lives of my patients.\n Raising awareness of the importance of social interactions on pain and pain management.  Legitimizing the merit of social interaction and the pain experience.\nWhat is your teaching passion? \nMy passion is working with student’s face-to-face interaction and the personal connections. It is also finding the best way for a learner to get the information. I can’t say I have one realm that excites me more.\nWhat are your practice interests? \nI have had a varied career from adults in cardiac service to neonates to children and adolescents \nI currently work in acute pain management and am CNS on chronic pain service. Teens living with chronic pain the chronic pain and chronic illness in general.\nFuture research\nI feel my research is at the beginning of looking at the impact of friendship relationship on pain.\nI am working on research ideas and submitting grants in my post-doc work related to this phenomena\nWant to delve deeper into qualitative methods and do some observational studies and explore interactions. \nI also want to look at various types of interactions and their impact on pain. \nWe need to see if these things can improve the pain experience for these individuals. Anything which help them with the pain experience I can do.\nI also want to see what pieces we need to add to measurement to help relieve pain in these teens. \n\n\nWhat contributions would you make to DUSON? \n\nI can continue to develop a program a research that is new yet well within nursing’s scope of  practice.\nI can bring my connections within groups looking at pain and the world leaders in pain.\nI have contact in Jordan, Thailand and Brazil so I think I could bring those connections and the continued collaborations with the group I have here in Canada.\nI know you have suspended you CNS stream but I think that is an added benefit. \nBeing able to connect with other faculty at the University, Dr. Ken Dodge at Duke who is in the psychology department. I used his theory on children with aggressive behavior issues and adapted his views on friend behaviors and adapted it for my research.\nI have done lots of works to help establish resources and center which specialize in pain management in children globally (Child Kind is a group of clinicians and researchers will try help establish certifications for centers of excellence in pain management of children). The goals of these organizations are to help establish centers and resources like we have for cancer and arthritis pain.\n\n\nShe had questions about appointment and asked for clarification in difference in btw research and tenure track\nI would like to be in place in my new role by the summer/fall of 2012.\nDeal Breaker-Husband being obstructed from work with relocation.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"923","CandID":"354","CommenterInitials":"SD","DateOfComment":"2011-10-06T00:00:00","Comment":"Currently in a .

She has 3 publications in refereed journals and 4 manuscripts in preparation; all are joint authorship & she is first author on 1 published and 4 of those in preparation.  This seems appropriate for her career stage.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nI am not clear what her focus of research is from a review of her CV.  Her publications focus on domestic violence in Hispanics, smoking among college women, RN retention strategies, and scope of practice.  Her post-doc work is clearly focused, but that is to be expected.  Her letter describes the policy implications of her post-doc work, but the policy piece seems to me to be an “after thought,” not a passionate life’s work.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nHer letter says she has 7 years’ teaching experience and that it’s both didactic and clinical, yet her position at USC for 7 years has been as a CI.  If the CI role there includes didactic teaching, course responsibility, and responsibility in the full scope of the faculty role, that would be most unusual.  She is currently working with Dr. Corazzini to teach a DUSON course in applied stats.  I see no teaching at all related to health policy.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nShe has experience as a perinatal educator (7 years), RN, (1 year), and Psych NP, but the latter is only for 1 year.

Yes, her PhD is in public health/health services policy/management, but the only policy experience or work I see is the 1 year on the SCNA legislative committee.  Personal testimony before state legislative committees is nice, but does not speak to expertise in health policy, in my opinion.

Short term, of course, would be to learn a new environment and how I can contribute to it.  I expect to continue my scholarship and “push the margins” of what nursing scholarship can add to the body of knowledge that gets translated to communities.  I think the potential for that is “wide open and intriguing,” and I would look forward to working in an interdisciplinary fashion to pursue this work.\n\nWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nOn a personal basis, my children are grown, and I am able to make a move.  I think I’ve reached a point where I’m curious to be in another setting/environment (particularly on a “full service” campus) where scholars from various disciplines (e.g., Philosophy) can come together to do research and innovative projects.  UCSF is strictly health-oriented, so the possibility of working with colleagues from non-health areas is intriguing.\n\nWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nI think UCSF has a great PhD program and talented PhD students, but when I came to Duke to consult on your PhD program, I felt an excitement and commitment among the faculty that energized me and made me think about new possibilities.  Also – to be honest – I think it would be wonderful to be in an environment where resources are abundant.\n\nWhat are your strengths?\nI have a proclivity for social justice, and that drives me.  My work on the disparities study section of NIH helps me stay on the forefront of work in this area.  I am an experienced teacher (at the MSN and PhD levels) and am comfortable with curriculum development.  I also enjoy and am successful at mentoring junior faculty in their teaching and research careers … and I like to do that!  I am a good member of the community.

However, I have taught classes of 100+ in family theory (though that was a while ago), and I often teach courses for PhD or FNP students where there are 30 students in the class … and I’m OK with this.  I’ve taught health disparities and family health and regularly teach in the FNP program.  I am comfortable with using online material to support a course, but I do not think I would like teaching totally online.\n\nWhat are your research interests?

Should we decide to move forward with this candidate, we will need to confirm her (?) dissertation defense date … the CV indicates completion of the PhD in August 2012.\n\nRESEARCH FUNDING & PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  \nThe Masters of Public Health (Epidemiology) was completed in 2005, and she has been in doctoral study since 2008.  The CV documents “research participation prior to USA residency” – she was a researcher on 6 studies in Korea, all related to infection control.  It is not clear what her role as a “researcher” was.  She has 2 publications in press (as 1st author), 1 from 2008 (author #10 of 11), 2 in 2004 (author #1 on both), and 1 in 2003 (#2 of 6).  She also has 2 book chapters in 2012, 1 in 2007, and 4 in 2006.  All publications focus on infection control.  She has presented her infection control work at national/international conferences in 2011, 2010, 2005, and 2004.  None of these publications or presentations have to do with health policy, though her letter indicates that she is has a manuscript draft that is a “policy analysis of hospitals’ isolation precautions for visitors.”  \n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nIt is clear that this candidate’s area of focus for many years has been infection control.  Neither her letter or CV outlines future research activities, but given her long history, it seems safe to assume that she will continue this line of scholarly work.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nCV documents 2-year appointment at UNC as a “Teaching Assistant & Student Recruiter.”  The description of this position says nothing about teaching responsibilities, but the letter does note that she has “received high scores in lecture evaluations from a variety of audiences such as students and conference attendees.”  It would seem that her teaching experience is very limited, and there is no indication that she has taught anything about health policy.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nThis candidate is licensed as an RN in NY and Korea, and is certified in infection control and epidemiology.  She documents clinical practice (as an infection control nurse) in Korea through 2007,but has had no clinical experience in the US.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nShe is a member of various US and Korean associations that focus on infection control, serves currently as VP of the NC Korean Nurses Association, and was a Board member 92006-08) for the Korean national  certification exam for APNs in infection control.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nHer initial job as an RN in Korea was for 3 years (2000-03), followed by 4 years (2003-07) as an infection control nurse in Korea.  Since then, she has been a lecturer for 2 different organizations for a few months each, an RA (2009-10) and TA/Recruiter (2010-12) at UNC, and a healthcare-associated infections analyst (for 2 semesters) with the UNC Healthcare System.  \n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nHer area of work related to infection control seems promising, but I see no preparation or experience related to health policy in general.  There is no indication that she understands how US policy-making bodies work (other than, perhaps, within a hospital and related to infection control policies).

The letter indicates he has done co-teaching, curricula planning and evaluation of courses … undergraduate and graduate.  There is no evidence of his having had any course responsibility or responsibilities related to clinical teaching, student advisement, etc.  His letter suggests he would like to teach research.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nThis is limited.  He has a total of 4 years of clinical practice, 3 as a staff nurse in a SNF/rehab center and 1 as the Assistant Director of Home Health Services at a senior living community.  He documents no certifications.  He has no experience in the acute care setting (which would probably be important for the ABSN Adult Health position), and he holds no certifications.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nThis candidate is a member of several associations that relate to his area of research.  To date, he has no involvement on committees, as an officer, or as a volunteer.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nHis “jobs” have been rather short-term, probably because of his involvement in school.\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nAs a new scientist, he would seem to be “primed” for a research career.  However, I am concerned about his preparation for, experience related to, and interest in teaching Adult Health in the ABSN program.  I also question whether another faculty member whose research interests relate to the elderly, falls, and so on would serve to broaden the expertise on DUSON’s faculty.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1008","CandID":"388","CommenterInitials":"CEB","DateOfComment":"2012-04-02T00:00:00","Comment":"Candidate:      Young                                            \t\t\t Position:  HP\nDo not recommend phone screen\nAreas of Evaluation\nResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.

I want to be able to exist in an environment where I can work towards establishing myself as a PhD prepared researcher and educator.\nWhy duke??\nI am interested in Duke because of the academic reputation of Duke and the organizational structure that supports the growth of junior faculty researchers. I also see several faculty members on the website who have similar interest as mine.\n\nWhat are your strengths? \nThe work I have done with the translational of information working with secondary analysis of large data sets.  I really enjoy working with the vast data available for further analysis and exploration. There is a cadre of individuals who have strengths in this area and I believe my doctoral work is preparing me to be one of those individuals.  \n\nWhat are you weaknesses? \nLearning to balance and not over extend myself. I want to do everything and sometimes that is just not realistic.\n\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment? \nBesides my family earning my PhD and following y passion for this population. I love the aging population and the focus on rehabilitation and improved quality of life my research outcomes can lead to.\nWhat is your teaching passion? \nI like being in the classroom and sharing what I know about patient care with students\n\nWhat are your practice interests? \nWhen I asked him about his previous positions in clinical practice and shared with him this was an adult health position with an acute care focus, he was taken off guard and stated he thought the position was focus on the adult health needs of the older client. He did say his training was in acute care settings but his focus in clinical practice has been  on the older adult. However, he was open to new opportunities.\n\nFuture research\nI would like to continue to look at post-acute care and management of the older adult specifically in relation to policy development and utilization metrics for length of stay after THR. I have really thought about my research and how it will help with the establishment of EB policy and procedures regarding care of the older adult in long-term care and rehab facilities.\n\nWhat contributions would you make to DUSON? \n“I am a very diverse candidate. I am an African American male and can make contributions related to the perspective of African Americans, African American males and males. This will assist in providing great insight and facilitation of the needs of these populations. I also think my focus on research in the aging populations along with my expertise in long-term care and rehab along with skills in secondary analysis is a plus.”\n\nTell me more about your responsibility in the academic positions you have held?\nMy role was to support faculty members in these roles. I was responsible for grading papers and leading groups in literature critique. I conducted lectures with a focus on older adults in foundations health assessment and have led a few on-line chats and lectures on secondary analysis and created some resources around secondary analysis from my work.\nI found his teaching experience and practice based knowledge in care of the adult health acute care client to be weak. However, I think his experience is transferable and he has the willingness to teach in the ABSN program. He was enthusiastic, clearly articulated his goals and willingness to grow and be mentored.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1020","CandID":"393","CommenterInitials":"TV","DateOfComment":"2012-05-02T00:00:00","Comment":"RECOMMENDATION  …  \nThis candidate has strength as an NP and seems to have some limited teaching experience (online).  However, there is limited evidence of contributions in other areas, and his cover letter makes me question if he intends to stay in NY and engage with DUSON only online.  It also looks like he plans to complete his DNP in December 2012, so that would need to be verified.  I recommend a phone screen to clarify these areas, though I could easily accept a “reject” if that is the sense of the committee.\n\nRESEARCH FUNDING & PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY APPROPRIATE FOR CAREER STAGE  …  \nThis candidate documents no scholarly activities … no research, no grants (not even applications), no publications, and no presentations.  He does not even speak to the focus of his DNP “capstone” project.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nNone\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nThe resume notes that he “works as a mentor in the DNP program,” but that is not explained in the resume or letter.  He also notes that he is an adjunct faculty member in nursing – “Hybrid Cohort Professor in Pharmacology” – in the online MSN program.  It’s not clear what kind of responsibility he has for this course … full responsibility, or guest lectures, or a TA?  His letter says nothing about his teaching experience.\n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE\nHe has been an NP for more than 10 years, with all of this work being in acute care settings, not primary care.  I do not know what the MSN needs are regarding acute vs. primary care.  In his current position as Chief NP for Emergency Medicine, he has extensive responsibilities that suggest he is quite competent.  He also serves as a consultant for a firm, which suggests his expertise is recognized and respected.\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nThe resume notes that he was his school’s president and NSNA recruiter, but he documents no membership – let along involvement – in professional associations.  I find this troublesome since he has been an RN since 1997 and an NP since 2000.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nHe is in his current position for approximately 10 years.  In addition to this position (which I assume is FT, given the title), he also holds 3 other positions (2 as adjunct faculty in 2 different universities since October 2011 and 1 since 2004).  I wonder how he manages all 4 of these jobs, in addition to his DNP program.\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nI must say I was “turned off” by all the references in his cover letter to MEDICINE and MEDICAL professionals and the evolution of the MEDICAL field.  There was nothing in his letter that spoke to NURSING.  His letter also talked about wanting to be “part of the administrative staff.”  Does he understand what an academic institution is and what it would mean to be a faculty member?  I’m not sure.  While he was clear that he would want to maintain a clinical practice, his statement about wanting to “continue to advance … educationally and as a person” was quite vague.  Quite frankly, I suppose he could teach NP courses, but I am not confident that he would contribute in any other way.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1021","CandID":"392","CommenterInitials":"CEB","DateOfComment":"2012-05-07T00:00:00","Comment":"Candidate:  Vaughna Galvin                             \t Position:  Anesthesia Program Assistant Director\n\nRecommendation: Do not pursue \n\nAreas of Evaluation\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.

I am able to communicate with others but it might be hard for me to relate or tell a joke for example. Sometimes it is a challenge.\n\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment? \nMy PhD thesis, and having 3 manuscripts published in reputable journals. I explored the feasibility of including molecular genetic information into the HER. Doing this project allowed me to construct the first knowledge base about cystic fibrosis including molecular genetics and health care. I was able to connect the OWL knowledge base with HER database. Developed new graphic methods to analyze large datasets by using frequencies and hierarchal modeling??? Developed online user friendly knowledge management tool (LITE) Librarian Infobutton Tailoring Environment, to be used at the point of care.\nWhat is your teaching passion? \nI have experience of delivering tutorials and presentations. I also took an online class on how to teach which was organized by NIH. It basically covered teaching in American universities, how to develop a syllabus, and be a good teacher.\nWhat are your practice interests? \nI have been working in this area for 10 years. I want to make an impact by doing research with hopes that my research can be used in rural practice by clinicians to improve work experience and patient outcomes. I also want to educate more individuals in this field.\n\nFuture research\nMy main interests are information needs and doing clinical information need consultations. I am also interested in creating information aids in the clinical settings. I want to examine how to improve use of clinical notes and improve secondary use of clinical notes.\nI want to do more research and gain more funding to improve healthcare\n\nWhat contributions would you make to DUSON? \nMy knowledge base and skills in technical aspects of informatics research and my ability to carry a project forward. Collaboration with other has always been a strength, for example my work with Dr. Cimino.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1037","CandID":"378","CommenterInitials":"CA","DateOfComment":"2012-01-16T00:00:00","Comment":"Comments following Skype with Dr. Tzeng (as entered by CA)\nNice experience in large ABSN programs, none across programs; may be overwhelmed by 4 programs; her school is not complex; good ABSN program leader; not mention of DNP or PhD; did not seem to answer questions re:  community partnerships, no vision of academic nursing; no depth in responses.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1038","CandID":"403","CommenterInitials":"AV","DateOfComment":"2012-08-02T00:00:00","Comment":"Candidate:         Remi Hueckel                                   \t\t\t Position:  ACPNP\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nAppropriate for career stage and clinical focus.

It’s difficult for me to judge what these experiences mean.  He is the lead author on a 2012 publication in the AMIA journal, which is nice.  He also documents 3 conference presentations (I think), and 1 paper on ontologies in conference proceedings.  There is no grant involvement noted, but the system in Spain may be very different regarding PhD students writing grants, etc.\n\nFOCUSED PROGRAM OF RESEARCH  …  \nHis focus of research is on ontologies, but there is no explanation in his letter about future goals or a trajectory of research.\n\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE CONGRUENT WITH POSITION’S NEEDS  …  \nCandidate has taught a graduate-level course in advanced programming for 2 years.  To me, advanced programming is different from informatics, but … what do I know?  \n\nRELEVANCE & EXTENT OF CLINICAL PRACTICE …\nN/A\n\nSERVICE TO THE PROFESSION  …  \nI see none documented on the CV … but I don’t know what is typical in Spain.\n\nJOB STABILITY  …  \nMost jobs have been short-term … I assume he has been a full-time student.\n\nAREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO/MATCH WITH DUSON  …  \nOther than the fact that he would bring diversity to the faculty (as a male whose “mother tongue” is Spanish), I am not convinced he would make a particularly unique contribution to meet our needs.  His letter is well-written, so English does not seem to be any problem for him.  Overall, I was not particularly impressed with this candidate, but – again – would defer to my Informatics candidates’ evaluation of his potential.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1053","CandID":"411","CommenterInitials":"SD","DateOfComment":"2012-08-18T00:00:00","Comment":"Recommend:  Phone Screen\n\nCurrently a doctoral student in the Department of Biostatistics at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and expect to graduate in Nov 2012.\n\nAreas of Evaluation\nA.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nShe has 5 data-based publications and two under review. \nShe currently works as a graduate statistical consultant in the School of Nursing (SON), UCLA for\npast five years.

I’ve “eased into” some aspects of the role as a contract faculty member at DUSON (teaching, managing courses, engaging in simulation activities), but I’ve not been involved in curriculum work, admissions, and so on. \nLong-term  …  Be a fully contributing member of a faculty, while maintaining a practice role and engaging in scholarly work [see below]\n\nWHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)\nI’ve always wanted to be in an academic role … my father is a professor, and I love hearing him talk about the success of his students, etc.  I also would like the opportunity to continue to balance teaching and practice.  I’ve seen faculty in the role and am energized about how passionate they are about what they do.  I’d like to add to my “skill set” by becoming more competent in curriculum development, etc.\n\nWHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  \nAs a contract faculty member, I’ve been “on the fringes” of activities at DUSON and am excited about what I see faculty and students doing.  I know the health system and have many good connections and strong professional relationships with individuals there that I’d like to maintain … and use to the advantage of students … and I just love this place.  I’ve been a student here and a contract faculty, and I really can’t imagine being anywhere else.  This is the place for me!\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?\nI know DUSON, DUHS and Duke.  I am a strong clinician and leader in the health system, and am on committees that are trying to affect change in the system.  I attend Teaching Conversations and really learn a great deal from the exchange of ideas, and I’ve had strong mentors who I know I can continue to call on as I move into a new role.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?\nI really do not know the formality of what it is to be a faculty member.  Although I’ve been successful as a teacher, I’ve done that with no preparation in teaching … so I would need to learn more about teaching principles, etc.  \n\nWHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?\nI went to DUHS to develop the clinical team in the PICU.  I realized that part of team development would be the initial and ongoing preparation of members of the team, so I connected with Sharron Docherty, and we worked together to develop the team and, at the same time, precept students.

I also am working with UAB faculty to help them think through how to do their combined primary/acute care PNP program online using simulations.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION” … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE\nI love using case studies and simulation.  I’ve worked primarily with small groups of students (N=12), so larger groups might be a challenge.  I have not taught online, but I was a student in the online DNP program.  \n\nWHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?\nI’m very interested in process improvement work that will ensure the safety of patients and effective functioning of teams in emergency situations.  I did some work on this for my DNP capstone, and that work has “uncovered” other aspects of the system that need attention and improvement.  As a member of the health system patient safety committee, I’m working with others to begin to design ways to improve our processes during emergencies.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?\nI definitely want to maintain a practice role, and have talked with my MD colleague about that possibility; he is most supportive and has suggested some unique ways I might be able to stay involved were I to move into a full-time faculty position.\n\nISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.\nNot applicable.\nFYI … The “in press” article is expected to be published in October.\nFYI  …  The “SON/SOM collaboration small group facilitator” was working with Beth Phillips on the collaborative efforts between ABSN and SOM students.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1059","CandID":"413","CommenterInitials":"SD","DateOfComment":"2012-08-22T00:00:00","Comment":"Telephone Screen\n\nOverall Assessment:  This is an excellent candidate with great passion and experience as a statistician in 2 schools of nursing.  I recommend that we recommend a campus visit. \n\nA.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\n-Longterm:  To continue to develop his methodological and substantive research program.  In addition to his interest in longitudinal statistical methods he has develop a program of research surrounding the statistical needs and methods of nursing scientists. After working as a statistician in two schools of nursing he has realized a need to understand the analysis needs of nursing scientists. Currently there are no statistical competencies for nursing scientists.  Nobody has rigorously studied the needs of nursing scientists.  He would like to develop the evidence for this.

(If they are currently in a position)\nHe was trained as a biostatistician and worked at NIH and NASA as a biostatistician. But over the past 4 years he has worked in academic nursing setting as the sole statistician.  He has really found a passion for this work in the field of nursing b/c of the balance between research/teaching.  He really enjoys the full range of studies and methodologies from across the lifespan and range of substantive areas.  He was at Johns Hopkins for 3-4 years and then left to take a position at Rutgers. His draw to Rutgers was a new Dean who had a desire to build the research program in that school.  However, in the very near future Rutgers will be merging with the New Jersey State School University.  This merger will likely eliminate many nontenured faculty positions and will have a deleterious impact on the research program of that school. \n\nC.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nInterested in working at a research intensive university.  Duke as a superior reputation.

Can get in easily over his head because of the difficulty saying no. \n\nF.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\n-worked with NIH for 7-8 years, then moved to Hopkins, then to Rutgers.  All of these steps have led him to this path to developing what are the statistical methods needs for nursing scientistists.  He was co-editor of a special edition of Nursing Research on statistics in nursing. \n-this past year at the Annual Joint Statistical Meetings (several statistical societies (over 5000 statisticians attend) he organized 3 - 4 sessions for statisticians in nursing. 1. Round table discussion on topic of statistics education for graduate nursing students. Pedagogy, assessment.  2. A panel of 5 statisticians working in the nursing field.

Been working as a consultant and teaching at an associate level. I want to be able to continue my research in an environment where people have similar interest and the desire to mentor and support a junior faculty member. I want to be able to exist in an environment where I can work towards establishing myself as a PhD prepared researcher and educator.\nWhy duke??\nLove to teach and love teaching pharm. Think I have developed good teaching skills and I think I am ready to teach at a higher level. I am consulting  at UNC and I like atmosphere where research and dynamics of institution which is conducive to growth.\n\nWhat are your strengths? \nTeaching skills based on evaluations. I think I am good at conveying information in an interesting and relevant manner. Just recently I completed graduate certificate in e-learning.  This has helped me with my strength in online teaching.I also think I have diversity in skills like teaching, research, and practice.\nWhat are you weaknesses? \nI am not a too specialized. I am particularly very familiar with oncology but other than that my skills are not specialty specific.\nWhat is your most significant accomplishment? \nCompleting my PhD in pharm and the research which supported it, this led to clinical use of a  therapeutic class of drugs  and interventions for enhanced relaxation mediated by nitrous oxide. This work contributed to the use of drugs like Viagra being used clinically.\nWhat is your teaching passion? \nMost of my classes are classroom. I have taught a fair number of labs. My passion lies in the classroom and student centered learning. Engaging the students and getting them to use the knowledge they have learned.\nWhat are your practice interests? \nI have not practiced in a pharmacy in a number of years. But in my research I have been working on clinical studies protocols for 2nd & 3rd line protocols for elderly individuals to determine the impact  on QOL and function in this population.\nFuture research\nClinical research, I am interested in QOL and new novel pharmacological approaches to cancer therapy.\nWhat contributions would you make to DUSON? \n“My background in pharmacology.” It comes from the medical school and pharmacy perspective my recent education and e-learning. \nDiscuss your scholarship it looks limited on you CV.\nI work in a core group of researcher very early in the research process. So my publications are in association with their work in the early phase of development.  I also have experience reviewing textbooks and number of publication from my graduate research.\n\nHow do you think your skills will fit with the teaching expectation s as describe on the position announcement?\nI have a good perspective on how drugs are to be used. What clinical tests need to be done to monitor effectiveness and I have worked with drugs at all phases of clinical development. \nI have been fairly active in simulating sterile preparation of medication. I also have actively taught a capstone course for the program reviewing pharmacy law and federal requirements. Feel like I am up to speed on pharmacy even though my practice is not current. I am staying active. I am not currently teaching graduate level students. The pharmacology is taught to the clinical trials researchers and usually I am more impeded by the fact that the students don’t understand clinical experience and background from a pharmacy perspective.\n\nScholarly presentation what would it be to demonstrate your strengths and abilities for the position?\n\nI would present e-learning and instructional strategies which might be used to teach pharmacology.\nI could also present research which I have done in the past but I would think you would be more interested in my teaching style.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1070","CandID":"407","CommenterInitials":"CEB","DateOfComment":"2012-09-10T00:00:00","Comment":"Phone Screen: Do not recomments further recruitment. \nA.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?

(IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)\nMy initial degree was in Education, and while I’ve enjoyed the work I’ve done in recent years and been fulfilled by it, “I always wanted to go back to teaching.”  This position would allow me to do more teaching.  It also would give me the opportunity to be integrated with faculty and students and “feel like I’m an integral part of something bigger.”\n\nWHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  \nI came to Duke in 2000 to do animal research in cell biology.  I did that for 4 years and then was appointed as a faculty member in the Division of Pulmonology.  Although I was a faculty member, I essentially was a “glorified post-doc,” spending all of my time doing research.  Duke is an excellent place, and the opportunity to have a “real” faculty position here is very exciting.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?\nI’m an independent investigator with a good funding record … I’m a good collaborator (both within and outside Duke) … I’m a good communicator (in writing and in lecturing/presenting, which translates to teaching others) … I do not necessarily think of myself as a leader, but people often look to me for that, and I’ve been successful in taking on that role … I’m a very disciplined person\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?\nI sometimes take on too much and can’t say “No.”  I would benefit from guidance on how to be better at not taking on too much but still making a significant contribution to the organization.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?\nI got a great deal of satisfaction from the NIH R01 award … to me, it was a vote of confidence from my peers that my work could make an important contribution to the field.  I also think a significant accomplishment when I see students have those “Aha moments” or when those who “fought” my pushing them come back to say how much they appreciated being pushed.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION” … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE\nI tend to push students to go outside their comfort zone.  I’m open to learning new pedagogical methods.  I have taught CRNA courses where some students were at a distant site, but I have not taught online.  I value problem-based learning and group work.  I think it’s easier to do PBL and group work in smaller classes, but I also think that with several faculty involved in the course, this can be facilitated in larger classes as well.  I would welcome the opportunity to co-teach, especially with a nurse who can enhance discussions be calling on her/his clinical experiences.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?\nI would like to continue to focus on respiratory problems, looking at overall lung function – and lung mechanisms – not just the cellular and sub-cellular levels.  As mentioned earlier, I also am interested in studying the most effective ways to help students learn Physiological concepts.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?\nN/A\n\nISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.\nQuestion from the Search Committee  What track is of most interest to you?  I want to challenge myself and think the tenure track would help me develop most, but I would not be happy to explore other track options as well.\n\nQuestions from Dr. Walker  What opportunities are there for leadership roles?  What is your timeline for completing the search and making this appointment?  I tried to answer these questions as best I could.\n\nNOTE  Dr. Walker asks that her exploration of this position be kept CONFIDENTIAL for now.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1075","CandID":"416","CommenterInitials":"AV","DateOfComment":"2012-10-22T00:00:00","Comment":"A.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\n-\tGoal is to do teaching; research; patient care if possible \n-\tHas done teaching and mentoring before – enjoys taking complex subject and teaching it in a way that students can learn it\n-\tLong term: grow as a nurse and teach new nurses\n-\tContribute to development of nurses and advance the profession; become an excellent teacher \n-\tScholarship/research goals\n-\tService goals\nB.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position?

Contribute to teaching as well as write grants and get funding \nLONG – Contribute to the faculty through ongoing research, teaching and service .. Build a nationally and internationally recognized program of research .. Publish/disseminate the knowledge my research generates so that it impacts the care of patients\n\nWHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A NEW FACULTY POSITION? (IF THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN A POSITION)\n“I’m paid to be curious, and I love that.”  But change builds character, and I’m looking for a challenge that will help me expand what I do so I continue to grow .. I would welcome a more “energized” environment and an attitude of “sure, we can do that,” which I know I’d find at Duke\n\nWHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A FACULTY POSITION AT DUKE?  \nI know the SON is ranked #7 and is outstanding, and Duke is ranked in the top 20 worldwide ...  Being at Duke would bring unique opportunities to work with “world class” people .. Resources available are excellent .. From my 5-week experience as a visiting professor, I got a real sense that Duke has a “can do” attitude, and I find that refreshing and energizing .. I have research collaborators in NC, so I could continue to work with them and my research would be seamless\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS?\nI am VERY unique in terms of my trans-disciplinary training, and I “speak the language” of many disciplines .. I’m collaborative and, in fact, need to work with trans-disciplinary teams to answer the questions I raise through my research .. I am good at forming networks .. I’m passionate about my research and am always learning .. I write well and present routinely .. I love to teach and mentor students\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES?\nI’m pretty intense and sometimes need to calm down a bit and appreciate that not everyone shares the same passions .. I sometimes need to do better with balance in my life (e.g., working hard and family)\n\nWHAT IS YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT?\nMy research related to heart failure – particularly as it relates to exercise – has impacted the care of those patients, and I’m recognized as an expert in this area (as noted by my appointment [the only Canadian] to the Heart Failure and Exercise Group of the National Heart and Lung Institute (NIH) and the recognition of our recent article on exercise and heart failure as the most influential paper on the subject.\nI also am excited about a new area of research, that of cardio-oncology [see question below about research interests]\n\nWHAT IS YOUR TEACHING PASSION … CLASS SIZE … CLINICAL GROUPS … ONLINE\nI’m particularly passionate about mentoring students as they do their own research and helping them move to where they want to go, not where I think they should go.  I also teach an entry-level graduate PT course to 80 on-campus students + 50 distance-based students who participate through television cameras.  I also teach in the lab where we integrate knowledge with real patient situations … and real patients.  No one taught me how to teach, and although I’ve won awards for teaching, I consider myself a work in progress who could benefit from more guidance on how to be a good teacher.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR RESEARCH INTERESTS … PROGRAM OF RESEARCH PLANS?\nI am increasingly interested in the prevention of heart failure, not just the treatment of it.  My most recent area of research – one I anticipate will increasingly be the focus of my work – is cardio-oncology.  We are finding that women who have been treated for breast cancer survive that event only to have hearts that function at a capacity one would expect of someone 30 years older than what they actually are.  We are building a program around this area, and I’m one of the founding members of that team.  We established a clinic and are starting a large trial to study the impact on heart function of (a) typical treatment methods and (b) the involvement in  non-pharmacological methods (e.g., nutrition, exercise, etc.) through our clinic.  This has great potential to enhance cardiac function in women with or who have survived breast CA.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR PRACTICE INTERESTS?\nNot applicable\n\nISSUES OR QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN REVIEW OF THE APPLICANT BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.\nNo specific questions identified by the committee","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1096","CandID":"428","CommenterInitials":"MEZ","DateOfComment":"2013-01-02T00:00:00","Comment":"12/20/2012\n\nHad a wonderful conversation with Dr. Haykowsky today.

Dr. Ankem has 11 publications; these publications are in the areas of information seeking and needs, the conduct of meta-analyses, and the effects of internet use. He has two grants, one as PI from the National Library of Science and another as a co-investigator from the University of Alabama. He was three Scholarships all from the University of Alabama.  \n\n2.\tFocused program of research. In his cover letter, Dr. Ankem wants to extend his program of research to “examine the effectiveness of clinical informatics applications and the factors that influence use of consumer health informatics applications.”  Unfortunately, there was little description of his research areas, specifically what his findings have been and what specific directions he wants to take his research.\n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs. He has taught numerous courses, such as: health information, evidence based practice, organization of information, research methods and quantitative methods. Further, he has developed such courses as: introduction to informatics, database design, information retrieval, nursing and healthcare informatics and evidence based practice in nursing and healthcare.  He has also been involved with Capstone. His teaching has targeted Master’s, DNP and Ph.D. students, with materials being delivered online and in blended formats. Overall, his teaching experiences seem to be a good fit with the position. \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice. There is no evidence of clinical practice. However, he has provided help to faculty in terms of evaluating surveys, data management, acquiring and organizing materials.\n\n5.\tService to the profession. He has served on numerous committees at the various institutions he was at. He has or is presently serving on several national/regional editorial boards. He is associated with several professional organizations (e.g., American Medical Informatics Association, Medical Library Association).  \n\n6.\tJob stability. Somewhat difficult to discern. It appears he was an Assistant Professor at Wayne State University from August 2001-May of 2005 in the Library and Information Science Program. It then appears he had a position as Associate Professor at North Carolina Central University, School of Library and information Sciences from August 2005-May of 2011. His current position, as of August 2011, is as Associate Professor at Emporia State University in the School of Library and Information Management. So overall, he has had some job stability.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Overall, his teaching experiences and the courses he has taught would be a good match with DUSON. In particular, he is familiar with blending needs of different disciplines to create a program of education, as most recently evidenced at his current position at Emporia State University. In addition, he would probably contribute well in the area of service. It is less clear how his research interests would coincide with the interests of students and faculty because this area is the least developed in his application. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation: This applicant has notable strengths. It would be worthwhile to conduct a phone interview to at least get a better sense of his research interests. If would also be worthwhile to learn why he wants to leave his current position, which has been short in tenure.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1099","CandID":"436","CommenterInitials":"RBK","DateOfComment":"2013-01-15T00:00:00","Comment":"CONFIDENTIAL\nFaculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :  Kalyani Ankem                                               \t\t\t Position:  Informatics\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nThe last publication was in 2010; however one has been submitted for publication in 2012.

He has 10 publications and 5 additional manuscripts under review which is quite prolific for his career stage. Dr. Shaw currently has postdoctoral funding and previously received a NRSA from NINR as well as CTSA funding for 2 years while a doctoral student. He shows excellent ability at early career stage to acquire research funding. \n\n2.\tFocused program of research\nDr. Shaw’s research involves novel technologies to help people adhere to medical treatments regimens, self-manage chronic illness and maintain a healthy lifestyle. His previous research looked at a mobile device to help with weight loss. Currently he is using a commercially available online health portal to help post MI patients manage diabetes and their BP. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs\nDr. Shaw has very little teaching experience, most of which was gained through his doctoral program. He was a teaching associate in a BSN leadership class and has done several guest lectures in informatics and health promotion nursing classes. \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\nDr. Shaw practiced nursing for 4 years in adult health which adds clinical experience to his area of research. \n\n5.\tService to the profession\nDr. Shaw is an active member in the American Medical Informatics Association and reviews for three journals as an ad hoc reviewer. He has not held his first faculty position as of yet and has no faculty service experience. \n\n6.\tJob stability\nThe applicant spent 4 years in a clinical position and then 4 years in doctoral education. He is currently in a postdoctoral position. There are no problems indicated with job stability. \n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON\nThe applicant is well qualified as a junior faculty member in the area of informatics. He has a concentrated, yet young research trajectory. He has very little teaching experience but seems well qualified to develop in that area. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nContinued recruitment if we are looking for a junior faculty member in informatics as opposed to a midlevel or senior faculty member in informatics.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1106","CandID":"439","CommenterInitials":"WMS","DateOfComment":"2013-01-24T00:00:00","Comment":"1.

Adult health, medsurg, critical care and pathophysiology\na.\tClass size: Ideal 35-45 but does feel is can handle larger class sizes\nb.\tClinical groups: Currently he experiences clinical group sizes as large as 12 but feels that 8-9 is more appropriate for learning\nc.\tOnline: Is evolving and can provide real time interaction. Enjoys developing online classes and feel this is progressing towards synchronous work \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nPredictors of success in Undergraduate Nursing Education and needs of the underserved population (especially age 62-65 population) who do not have insurance but clearly cannot work or have do not have disability\n\nFeels it takes about 4 semesters to integrate into the school/courses which he would prefer before initiating research.\n\n9.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nPrimary care. Not sure what the future would be if he moves but main focus is primary care because he enjoys the variety within patient population.\n\n10.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nService:  Enjoys community engagement. Involving the Student Association.  Very interested in educating rural youth to health care careers.  Being in the United Sates\nTranslating current teaching practice from ABSN to MSN: Feels they are very similar and feels his skills are transferable. This may be due to the fact that he teaches in an ABSN program and not traditional students; are much more mature.\nChair three committees MSN thesis and member of 3 three MSN thesis\nCoordinator for Pathophysiology but is not for clinical management; currently teach in the ABSN program which is a 12 month program; intensive pace\nCardiology focus in graduate work but over the past two years he has worked in primary care with patient age range from 18-65\nCommittee member’s recommendation:\nAlex is very focused on teaching which is good match for the position.  His teaching at the MSN level (coordinating) is limited but his clinical practice gives him a wide variety of experience in adult health.

Assistant Professor of Nursing, Duke University School of Nursing\n\nA.\tNature of relationship between reference and candidate\nProfessional relationship.  Dr. Walker teaches the DUSON advanced physiological course. Sharon has sat in on the course Dr. Walker taught.\n\nB.\tDescribe candidate’s strengths related to position description \nHer knowledge. Has an incredibly about of knowledge about physiology but also biochemistry and pharmacology. Has background in education; hence her teaching methods are based on proven educational strategies. The amount of time Dr. Walker gives to students goes beyond what she is compensated for. Very professional. She challenges the students, which is great. In addition, she contributes based on her research. She has animal lab and does research on asthma. As such this provides opportunities for scholarship and mentoring. \n\nC.\tDescribe candidate’s weaknesses related to position description (ask for at least one area that needs improvement)\nNo real weakness. Not easy to identify what these weaknesses would be. \n\nD.\tDescribe candidate’s effectiveness of performing job  responsibilities \nIncredibly effectiveness. Devotes a lot of time with students. Tries to use different lecture techniques to accommodate to different learning styles. Appreciates student individuality. \n\nE.\tDescribe candidate’s interpersonal skills (e.g., what is it like to work with candidate)\n“She is great.”  Was described as: calm, professional, does not get emotional or angry, thoughtful, considerate and a wonderful colleague.  \n\nF.\tDescribe candidate’s attitude/relationships with a) students, b) colleagues  c) administrators\nVery service oriented attitude that lends itself to great relationships with all of the above.

Dr. Kennedy has 65 journal publications and several under review. She is first author on about a third of these publications. She has a total of 14 book chapters and two books. She has numerous presentations at the regional, national and international level. With respect to research funding, she currently has one NIH proposal as a co-investigator on the topic of symptom management. There are two other funded projects where she is the PI; however, these do not appear to be funded through the NIH or other external granting agencies. With respect to past funding, she was PI on two NIH/NINR proposals and several as PI from other funding sources that are appear more as institutional funding (e.g., faculty development awards, academic senate award, alumni funds). In general, her research funding and publication record is appropriate for the stage of her career. \n\n2.\tFocused program of research. Dr. Kennedy’s recent research interest – as expressed in the cover letter – is to develop mobile phone applications for low health literacy patients in primary care settings. In addition, her research interests include: 1) factors the influence risk taking behaviors in younger children, especially in different racial populations (e.g., Hispanic); 2) the bidirectionality between parental risk factors (e.g., stress, health seeking behaviors, sedentary behaviors, fatigue) and child health risk behaviors; and 3) ways to increase physical activity in parents and children through, for example, gaming technologies. A common theme in these research endeavors is the use of technological devises to promote change.    \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs. As stated in her CV, Dr. Kennedy has mentored 33 Ph.D. students through qualifying exams and/or dissertation – the focus of several dissertations were on children’s health often in the context of various disparities (e.g., race, income). Many of these students have research/academic positions. Courses she has taught at the Masters and Ph.D. levels were on such topics as infant and child development, advanced child and developmental science, human health and nursing systems, and parent and child nursing. The typical class size was between 20 to 30 students. No teaching evaluations were provided.  \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice. Dr. Kennedy has a California Registered Nurse License. From 1994 to 2010, she provided consultation on pediatric behavior issues to faculty and students at the now renamed Valencia Health Service Clinic. This clinic served as a training ground for faculty and Master NP students in pediatric primary care and to facilitate doctoral research involving Latino populations. She also served from 2006-2007 as a clinical consultant utilizing translational research and best practice approaches for implementing health behavior change with the primary care visit model. She has helped to establish as interdisciplinary team to provide health coaching for lifestyle changes, primarily physical activity. \n\n5.\tService to the profession. She was or is a member of several professional organizations, such as the Academy of Nursing, Society of Behavioral Medicine, Academic Pediatric Association, etc. She has/is serving as a reviewer for journals and served on several editorial boards. Her contributions to the SON, campus, and school of medicine are numerous. Of import, some of her service work as a consultant has been in the areas of pediatrics with agencies outside of the U.S. (e.g., India, Hong Kong).   \n\n6.\tJob stability. Dr. Kennedy has been with University of California, San Francisco, since 1991. \n\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Dr. Kennedy can contribute to both teaching and research in the area of pediatrics. Her interest in the use technologies that cover E-Health and M-health would be of interest to several faculty including those in the area of informatics. Her work with different racial populations and investigations into issues of disparities would be of interest to those faculty and students who do research in disparities and community health promotion activities. Some of her interests (e.g., promoting physical activity) cover areas of disease prevention; such an addition should be welcomed to the DUSON. Given her interaction overseas, she can assist with the DUSON efforts to establish teaching and research efforts aboard (e.g., China).\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  Do a phone interview.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1131","CandID":"448","CommenterInitials":"RBK","DateOfComment":"2013-03-12T00:00:00","Comment":"From telephone interview.

She would like to transfer her research operation and obtain funding through industry or PCORI. She would like to build a research team, establish connections and go for funding. She would like to remain in peds primary care area and can contribute in the developmental childhood area. She greatly enjoys mentoring masters and doctoral students. \n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nShe has had a happy and successful time at UCSF. The first reason she would like to leave is that “DUSON is growing rather than downsizing, Duke is creating programs, she knows Kathy and has watched her career.” Also, “UCSF has dwindled and is unable to support state and public education which has impacted the SON. The school is struggling to keep mounting expensive programs with resources not in place and is not fostering innovation.” She feels that UCSF SON is on a downward trajectory so she would like to reassess where to do the rest of her career. Naturallly, she “wanted to look at the east coast because she was from this area.”\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nShe is interested in DUSON because it is growing and there is potential for collaboration in research. Duke has multiscience schools such as engineering and cognitive science, so that appeals to her. She feels there is potential for inhouse collaboration also. \n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nHer strength is “in communication. She is relaxed and has high standards, and integrity.” She feels she can make  a solid contribution in many domains in nursing. \n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nOne weakness is “typing numbers.” She said this because she gave us the wrong phone number for the interview and we had a bit of trouble reaching her. She states she is not as assertive as she could be. She also states that rejection is difficult. One challenging thing for her is juggling things.\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nHer most significant accomplishment is “receiving the endowed chair in pediatrics which is reflective of overall career accomplishment.” Secondly her work with doctoral students is an accomplishment. \n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? (We did not get to this question as we were running out of time)\na.\tClass size\nb.\tClinical groups\nc.\tOnline\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nHer research interests are “children’s health behaviors and how illness influences health and behaviors on a day to day basis.” She is also interested in “cultural and ethnicity influences on behavior focusing in the area of television.” She is currently interested in “physical activity and obesity; looking at solutions to decrease sedentary behavior, in the Hispanic population.” She is currently working on a “mobile phone app to increase physical activity.” She will apply for a PCORI grant which she feels is better than the NIH and an RO1 to fund this research. “Her R01 will not get funded as it did not have a fundable score.” \n9.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nCurrently, she does not practice and has no plans to renew her peds primary certification. She has been doing consulting work over the last few years in the area of peds primary care. \n10.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation:\nShe does not seem to be a good match for DUSON for the senior researcher position and my recommendation is to cease further consideration.

Is on the last 1/3rd of her career. Short term, she wants to transfer her research operation to a new location (e.g., find new research team).  Short to longer term she wants to apply for grants.  She wants to continue to teach and mentor graduate students – which she thoroughly enjoys.\n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Not a great sense of clarify. Primarily, she wants to go to a place that is growing, which is unlike what is happening at her institution. She is also from the East coast, which is not a major reason.\n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Again, because of the growth of DUSON, under the leadership of Dr. Gilliss. She believes that at the university level there are several departments that she can collaborate with, such as engineering and cognitive sciences.  Specific to DUSON, she finds a cadre of faculty who are doing good research and teaching.  It was peculiar that when she began to respond to this question, she qualified her remarks based on her “distant assessment.”  Thus, not clear whether she spent a lot of time researching the university. \n\n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths? From a personality perspective, she is: 1) a good communicator, 2) relaxed, 3) has high standards for herself and others (e.g., students), 4) easy to get along with, 5) flexible, and 6) a team player. From a professional standpoint, she is well balanced, that is she has a well- rounded background in teach (“master teacher”), clinical practice (e.g., primary care settings)  – though not actively practicing now, and research. \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses? Not assertive at times speaking her mind. Continues to find rejection difficult to take. Has at times juggling the many day-to-day activities.\n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?  Receiving the endowed chair position at her institution. Personally, she feels her greatest accomplishments are working with doctoral students.\n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? (question not asked due to time constraints)\na.\tClass size\nb.\tClinical groups\nc.\tOnline\n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans? Has three main interests: 1) how illness influence children’s health behaviors; 2) how culture and ethnicity influence health behaviors – brought up the issue of the media, and 3) exploring factors that influence physical activity, especially sedentary behaviors (e.g., fatigue, men’s role). Would like to expand her work using M-health technology and apply them to dyads that involve both the child and the parents.  Her recent R01 application will not receive funding. She has a couple of small grants.  She wanted to know whether anyone had an interest in submitting a P30 application using technologies. \n\n9.\tWhat are your practice interests? No discussed due to time limitations.\n\n10.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation:  I am ambivalent about bringing her in for an interview.  I think she could play a role in the conduct of research pertaining to preventive behaviors with children, as well as teaching courses and mentoring graduate students with interests in child health. She may also fit well with informatics. She seems to be an excellent mentor.  She does not bring in a lot of resources.  Seems she wants to go to an environment that is growing.  I am also not clear how many more years she would want as a faculty member given that she is at the last “1/3rd” of her career. I would suggest the full committee discuss this applicant.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1133","CandID":"453","CommenterInitials":"WTB","DateOfComment":"2013-03-23T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant : \t  REID, Paula     Position:   Community Health NP\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\t Research funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nTotal funding $25,000. 2 peer pubs, 2 in press, 3 submitted; 5 in progress; 3 abstracts; multiple posters.\n\n\n2.\t Focused program of research\nWomen’s health related to HIV \n\n\n3.\t Teaching experience congruent with position’s needs\n5 years’ experience teaching BSN and FNP students (UNC-W).

After an initial focus on teaching, she would eventually like to engage nursing students in community research.\nLong term:     Progress program of research which would be strongly driven by the research needs of the community partners.  \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nCurrently the scope of her position does not utilize all of her skills and potential. The faculty position would provide room for growth and allow her to contribute to the faculty and to DUSON. Would like to be involved in decision making processes and in current role she does not have the ability to contribute to improvement/change (non-voting). \n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nBefore her first position with DUSON, she reviewed the mission, value and goals of the DUSON and felt that they embodied her values. She also attended the CI intensive and Radical Transformation and truly felt that DUSON lived the mission statement and was not just words. She has developed substantial relationships with faculty and is excited about the CPI process.\n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nStrong work ethic and carries share of workload; good understanding of research and the research process. She has a strong background that demonstrates previous involvement not only in the research process but also in organizational change (she participated/led 15 implementation groups {109 staff members in her department} through organizational change).\n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nAlthough she currently teaches N243 with Dr. Hartman she considers herself a novice in nursing education and needs to increase knowledge of nursing education (although working in the CND has broadened knowledge in many areas). She has no experience in online teaching. \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nDonna is from an extremely rural area and is a first generation high school graduate (neither parent graduated from high school). She is also a first generation college graduate (undergraduate) in her entire family. College was not in family conversation.  To be able to complete her doctoral degree and transition into professional role is her most significant accomplishment. \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\nCommunity health, health disparities and health promotion. Would like to teach at the ABSN and MSN level.\nA.\tClass size – Prefers approximately 36-40 students. This allows for great diversity of thought, easier to break down into groups and faculty are not overwhelmed with grading assignments. However, she is aware of the number of students per ABSN cohort.\nB.\tClinical groups  -  Provides her an opportunity to individualize education and bond; current assignments do not allow for large groups of students (6-10). She understands that she will continue to serve in the CI role as Community Health faculty.\nC.\tOnline – Novice in this area and prefers the face to face encounter because she feels she is more effective in that venue, however very open to the idea. Online does allows one the opportunity to be creative. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nPrimary research interest is in the area of homelessness and health disparities.\nHer research plans will be in concert with community partners to fulfill their research needs. She would like to continue encourage student participation in the research process. Wants to contribute to nursing education literature through community health (example: students evaluating a community partners program). She currently has 3 abstracts accepted to present at the Association of Community Health Nurse Educator in June and has two abstracts pending for the American Public Health conference.  \nShe feels strongly about telling our community partners story through research and manuscripts. She considers one of her strengths to be qualitative research and would like to collaborate with other faculty members in the area of health disparities (i.e. OGACHI, MADIN II) and possibly comparing outcomes of local and abroad opportunities for students for differences.\n\n9.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nCommunity health; not in clinical practice at this time but is still certified.\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation:\nCampus visit","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1140","CandID":"454","CommenterInitials":"BC","DateOfComment":"2013-04-16T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :      Stewart Alexander,   PhD                                      \tPosition:  Senior Nurse Researcher\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nAuthored (7 first author) or co-authored 40 peer-reviewed articles since 2006; 2 book chapters and over 40 conference papers.

Much of her work is physician-patient communication however this can be translated across providers.  \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \n\nThe applicant is between junior and senior nurse researcher. No notable teaching experience and research career is definitely progressing but uncertain of her role in these studies.

Dr. Alexander has 41 peer reviewed journal publications, as well as 42 conference presentations. He is currently involved with 8 ongoing grants, none of which he is PI. He was involved in 12 prior grant funded projects.\n\n2.\tFocused program of research. His program of research is focused heavily on communication processes, especially those that focus on provider-patient exchanges involving lifestyle changes and medical decision-making. He has extensive experience developing and applying coding methods to analyze patient-provider communication. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  He has very limited experience teaching. Most recently, at High Point he has taught a mixed methods course and has been asked to teach in the Fall a course on qualitative methods. Between 1994 and 2001, he has taught courses on small group communication, interpersonal communication, and introduction to public speaking. Overall, there were no data on course evaluations, but in the section on professional awards and special recognitions, it does appear he has received excellent teaching evaluations.  There is no history of mentoring junior faculty, but has mentored 16 students, on which about ½ where graduate students.  \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice:   No relevant clinic practice noted.   \n\n5.\tService to the profession.  He is a member of the National Communication Association and the American Academy on Communication in HealthCare.  He has or is serving as a reviewer for numerous (N=10) journals, such as Academic Medicine, Family Medicine, Preventive Medicine and Psycho-Oncology. \n\n6.\tJob stability:  From 2002 until present, he has held position either at the Durham VAMA or at Duke University Medical Center. He lists as being an Assistant Research Professor at DUSON.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  As noted on his cover letter, Dr. Alexander can teach a variety of courses, including research methods, mixed methods, qualitative analyses, and various courses on communication. He would add substantial strength to areas of communication notably missing from DUSON, such as patient-provider communication. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nDr. Steward is a very promising scholar with a strong enthusiasm for teaching and research. However, he lacks experience obtaining grants as a PI and very limited, if any, teaching/mentoring experience of nursing students. As such, he may be too junior for this position – although with some mentoring, he may become a very accomplished senior researcher.  He would clearly add strength to processes of communication in clinical care and public health, and can teach courses that are of interest to students (e.g., mixed methods). I would recommend a follow-up phone call.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1146","CandID":"459","CommenterInitials":"BC","DateOfComment":"2013-04-18T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :            Elizabeth Kimball Todd Rende                         \t\t\t Position:  FNP\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nCompleted DNP at DUSON in 2012 but has not extended productivity beyond capstone (which is not unusual).

She has no publications. With respect to research funding, she lists being on five ongoing projects. Two are NIH funded projects, one on hypertension and one on glycemic control. She is working on a DNP capstone project -- she is a DNP student who is expected to graduate in December, 2013. She also listed two other research projects, one on nutrition and one on Tadalafil and Gastric emptying. \n\n2.\tFocused program of research. In the cover letter, three areas of research interests are diabetes, hypertension and thyroid disease. However, none of these areas are elaborated upon.   \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  According to the job ad, “Two to three years experience teaching at the graduate level and experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations are desirable.” It does not appear that Ms. Evans has thought graduate level courses. Her CV does mention that she has taught residents, fellows, and students on inpatient teaching services. However, her teaching experience is not elaborated upon. Thus, is seems questionnale whether she has the desirable level of teaching experience.    \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice.  From 2008 until the present, she has worked as an NP for both inpatient/outpatient care in the Duke University Medical Center’s Division of Endocrinology. During 2007, she had two NP internships, one in internal medicine (Shands Medical Group, FL) and in ambulatory care (Marion County Health Department, FL).

The latter, combined with her lack of teaching experience make me recommend no phone follow-up.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1151","CandID":"461","CommenterInitials":"AV","DateOfComment":"2013-04-22T00:00:00","Comment":"Areas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\n-\tCompleted PhD at Duquesne in 2012 – dissertation focused on nutrition in Mexican American children related to obesity\n-\tHas had small internal funding for her dissertation work but no federal or other larger training grants\n-\tHas presented her dissertation work at regional conference but no pubs other than one on educational scholarship topic.\n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship\n-\tPotential for further program of research in area of obesity, Mexican American children building on dissertation research \n-\tWould need mentoring but expresses desire for this type of environment to develop her research program\n-\t\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs\n-\tHas been an instructor since 2005 at Otterbein and for past year has been Assistant Professor- extensive teaching experience in those years per CV listing of courses taught\n-\tHas taught UG and Grad students \n-\tHas online teaching experience and expertise in areas of online teaching technologies that would help her transition to MSN teaching here\n-\tHas chaired honors’ theses and been on DNP committees in current role\n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\n-\tCurrent practicing FNP – since 2005 with focus on children and adolescents\n-\tPosition prior to this one was working with adults primarily chronic illness management\n-\tBoth experiences very relevant to this position\n\n5.\tService to the profession\n-\tMember of many national/international professional groups\n-\tOn many university and nursing school committees\n-\tIs director of NP programs in current role\n\n6.\tJob stability\n\n-\tNo issues noted\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON\n-\tResearch in addressing health disparities (nutrition in Mexican American children)\n-\tHas a lot of relevant teaching experience \n\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \n\n-\tShe does not have the scholarship (pubs; grants – even training grants) to support her scholarship potential yet but does have the relevant teaching experience for this position.

Dr. Toader has one publication in a peer reviewed journal (Journal of Community Mental Health Nursing). There does not seem to be any presentations given at conferences or elsewhere. In the cover letter, it specifies that she has “also participated in the grant-writing and data collection of our SAMHSA grant-funded program to provide integrated health services to our uninsured, under-insured, and homeless clients in our community.”\n\n2.\tFocused program of research. Not exactly clear. It appears that her scholarly interests pertain to mental health nursing (e.g., screening for diabetes in schizophrenia).  \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  Very vague. She specifies in her cover letter that she taught “both didactic and lecture type courses as well as clinical courses in various health care facilities in the area for undergraduate and the RN and BSN program.” Listing of these courses and teaching evaluations are not provided. \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice:   She has served as an impatient surgical nurse for about a year at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, then as a nurse case manager for close to two years at the Washtenaw County, Community Support and Treatment Services, and has apparently been promoted to the Nursing Services during 2013. As a nurse case manager, she worked with patients with severe psychiatric disabilities and their families to address, for example, patient and family needs (e.g., coordination, management and self-care, report of health status). In her present position, she supervises and coordinates the activities of nursing staff in the delivery of services while supporting the application and adherence to evidenced based best practices.  She is licensed (RN) in NC.  \n\n5.\tService to the profession.  Dr. Toader is Chair, of the Medication Management Committee of the Washtenaw County Community Mental Health and Washtenaw County Public Health Department. She is also the Co-Chair of the Infection Control Committee, Washtenaw County Community Mental Health and Washtenaw County Public Health Department. There is no evidence service to a professional organization or serving as a grant or journal reviewer. \n\n6.\tJob stability:  From July 2010 until the present, she has worked at the Washtenaw County Community Support and Treatment Services. It is important to note that she recently graduated with a DNP (April 2013) and obtained an MSN (2011) and BSN (2009). She is currently a faculty member at the Eastern Michigan’s University School of Nursing – length of time unspecified. In sum, during her short career, she has managed job stability.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Toader can help with the teaching of mental health nursing.  The teaching responsibilities for the community health position calls for “didactic and clinical instruction in the community health nursing course and didactic/seminar instruction in the health promotion/disease prevention course.” It appears that she has taught a course or more relevant to this position, but it is left unspecified. With respect to the population coordination position, the candidate should have experience in nursing education experience with program evaluation and also have a developed program of scholarship. She seems to have elements of these but are left vague. For example, while she plays a role in the implementation of evidence based practices, it is unclear to what extent she does program evaluations. I would not say she has a developed program of scholarship.\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nDr. Toader it at the very early stages of her career. She does seem to possess elements that are needed for both positions – a potential positive. However, the lack of detail in her application precludes any clear indication of which position she is most suited for.   At the very minimum, I would suggest a phone interview to clarify these issues – although I am also sympathetic to the notion of not having a follow-up intervview if someone does not bother to provide more details.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1158","CandID":"467","CommenterInitials":"LD","DateOfComment":"2013-04-27T00:00:00","Comment":"Areas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nNot much funding and few data-based pubs.

What are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\n\nShort-term: to engage in additional pedagogical development in order to become a better teacher; to complete the required curriculum revision of the NP program at her current institution; to further develop on-line educational methods of instruction within the NP program at her current institution.\n\nLong-term: to develop a relationship with a mentor to assist in developing a focused area of scholarship/research trajectory.\n\n2. Why are you interested in a new faculty position?\n\nPresent position as Director of NP Programs at Otterbein University (near Columbus OH) involves both administrative oversight and teaching obligations. The university, as a whole, is seen mainly as one dedicated to a teaching mission. While she enjoys teaching, she wants more of balance in her academic activities, and since finishing her dissertation, wants a chance to develop as a nurse scholar.\n\n3. Why are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?\n\nWants to be a part of an academic community (such as DUSON) with a recognized program of graduate study and an emphasis on scholarly efforts; Duke frequently came up in conversation during her doctoral studies at Duquesne.\n\n4. What are your strengths?\n\nExcellent clinician & primary care provider; excellent teacher with experience in teaching both pre-licensure & graduate level NP students; communicates well with students, other faculty, & staff.\n\n5. What are your weaknesses?\n\nTalks way too fast & too much (her self-assessment); has yet to establish a focused area of scholarship, especially as primary author on submitted manuscripts.\n\n6. What is your most significant accomplishment?\n\nAs Director of NP Programs, seeing her students earn high pass rates on NP board examinations; seeing her students become successful and knowing she had a role in their development.\n\n7. What is your teaching passion/philosophy?\n\nEmphasis on the word “participatory”; defines faculty role as one analogous to coach or mentor. Classroom activity, be it on campus or in the virtual world, needs to incorporate teaching/learning styles conducive to engaging the student and therefore instilling in the student a passion for that what is being taught.\n\n8. What are your research interests?\n\nStill nascent, but pointing in the area of her doctoral research, namely modifiable health risk factors; nutrition is one aspect of this interest as well as osteoporosis. Limited funding at this point.\n\n9. What are your practice interests?\n\nPrimary care; still practices one day a week as an FNP in a peds/adolescent health practice site. Also has experience as an FNP with adult chronic disease management in primary care settings. Would like to continue practicing as an NP with any faculty role.\n\n10. Questions brought up by faculty:\n\nFaculty practice models utilized at DUSON?\nMerits of tenure track versus practice track?\n\nCommittee member’s recommendations:\nThis is a strong candidate for the FNP faculty position. Excellent clinical preparation, 15 years experience as an FNP delivering primary care, recent graduate of a PhD program in nursing, & strong experience as an NP educator. While her area of scholarship stills needs to be defined, I would recommend that she be offered an on campus visit.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1178","CandID":"470","CommenterInitials":"BC","DateOfComment":"2013-05-18T00:00:00","Comment":"Areas of Evaluation\n1.\t1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\nDr. Attin has had two funded grants ($8,816 & $20,000), T32 and funded postdoc.

De Gagne, PhD.                       \t \tPosition:  HCPC\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Overall, productive based on stage of career. She has 9 peer reviewed journal articles, four as first author, seven non-referred or invited articles, 12 conference presentations, and 15 posters. She has 18 citations as an invited speaker. She received intramural funding on five occasions, about ½ as travel awards, and extramural funding for five projects/activities.   \n\n2.\tFocused program of research. Not very clear. Some of her research seems to involve informatics, disparities, and education (e.g., teaching strategies).  In her cover letter, it states, “my research and service activities in creating and implementing a patient centered approach to provide comprehensive care within the context of family and community would be of outmost service.” Unfortunately, details about the above are lacking.   \n\n1.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  In the cover letter, she states that, “ I am convinced that I am well prepared to teach areas of population health management, care team leadership, continuous quality improvement, health coaching and education, approaches to behavior changes, skill building for patient self-management, integrating community resources, evidence-based alerts, and more.” At Georgia State University she has taught Leadership in Promoting Innovations, Health Care Technology, and advanced Topics in Informatics. She has also taught at Walden University Transforming health care Through Information Technology and Informatics in Nursing and Healthcare.  Other topics taught include introduction to professional nursing, psychiatric nursing and computing and health information. Clearly, her main teaching is in the use of technology.  There are no teaching evaluations. \n\n2.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice.   She lists in her CV under “Professional Nursing Experience” having worked in nursing education, impatient psychiatry, and as a case manager. Overall, these activities span from 1990 through 2009, with some gaps in performing these duties.  \n\n3.\tService to the profession. She is a member of several organizations that seem to focus on geriatrics and informatics.  She serves or has served as a manuscript reviewer to several journals, several of which deal with education.  At Georgia State University and while at North Carolina Central University, she has demonstrated being part of several academic committees (e.g., program committees, technology committee, research advisory committees). \n\n4.\tJob stability. From 08/09 until the present, she has been in a department/school of nursing, North Carolina Center University and Georgia State University.  In general, she shows job stability. \n\n5.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Able to contribute in the areas of informatics, psychiatric nursing and gerontology. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  I think this candidate is very ambitious and has a wide spectrum of skills and education. With that said, it is not clear what she has done with case management and population health. Her background does have her working with different populations (e.g., Korean). Because of a lack of clarity of how her background fits well within the position, but clear evidence that this person show promise, I hesitate, but do recommend phone follow-up.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1180","CandID":"471","CommenterInitials":"AV","DateOfComment":"2013-05-20T00:00:00","Comment":"Areas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\n-\tCompleted PhD dissertation in 2010 – no pubs related to that on CV\n-\tFew clinical and research pubs - 2 articles; 1 book chapter\n-\t“Funded Research “ on CV appears to be simply studies for which she worked with investigators on data collection or other tasks; no independent or training grants noted.\n\n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship\n-\tDoes not speak to research in her cover letter and only references dissertation in CV\n-\t?

Did not differentiate between long and short term goals. She sees herself as an educator and continuing to teach and do research. Wants to stay in academia. \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position).  She taught undergraduate students at NCCU. She became interested in teaching students at a higher level of education, such as graduate students. She had the chance to do so at GSU (Georgia State University) to teach health informatics and leadership in innovation in health care.  Has family issues; her family is in NC. She travels every week to NC from Georgia.  Wants to go back to NC.  So in essence, it seems that a strong driving force is to find a position in NC to be close to her family. \n \n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke? She believes DUSON is a very high quality institution – has received and is getting degree from Duke (DNP). She is also familiar with DUSON faculty and works with Duke Faculty, such as Ellie McConnell – as part of a geriatric educational program.  Looked at competencies for coordinator and talked to Ellie McConnell who said she is qualified.  She also appreciates the good relationship between faculty and students. In sum, main reasons are: 1) excellent school, 2) good working relationships with faculty, and 3) likes the interactions between students and faculty. \n \n4.\tWhat are your strengths? See herself as: 1) having a great deal of self-discipline, 2) having high expectations, 3) being committed to and loving students, 4) having excellence in time management, and 5) achieving excellence.  \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses? High expectations produces a lot of stress – puts too much pressure on herself at times.  Need to reevaluate at times her expectations. \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment? Came from South Korea came to the U.S. with two kids. Very proud that she was able to work as a nurse full-time while being able to pursue her advanced degree.  Philosophically, she strongly believes in and is committed to life-long learning – will continue to do so.  She would like to transfer the life-long learning spirit to her students. She is proud of being able to get scholarship and pursue research. \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? Very student-centered and uses different strategies to match different student learning styles – also reported being an educational major and hence has theoretical knowledge about education.  Open to different teaching formats that vary in class size (7 to 70), seminar or not, synchronous or asynchronous, etc.., She can customize herself to the structure that is needed. For graduate classes, her ideal class size is between 25 to 30. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans? Gerontology education and self-management programs (urinary incontinence/bladder health). Likes to use new technologies (e.g., virtual worlds/online technologies – worked with Constance Johnson) for education, curriculum development and program evaluation.\n\n9.\tWhat are your practice interests? Population/community base.  She is more community based these days – working with someone in the community in South Korea. She wants to develop educational programs (e.g., self-management for chronic illnesses) for health care providers in community settings. \n\n10.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nI asked her two questions. First, given that she is a full time DNP student, I asked her how she can handle being a DNP student and being a full time faculty member. Her response was that she has been doing full time work on different tasks for many years. For example, she currently does the DUSON DNP Program while also teaching two to three courses a semester at GSU. She is getting consistently” A”s in her DNP courses. Thus, she sees herself as having very good time management skills. \n\nI also asked her to elaborate on her case management experiences. Her response was twofold. First, in South Korea she worked for large insurance company as a medical inspector -- really a case manager. She visited clients in home settings and did physical assessments and diagnosis. Based on the outcome, she created a care plan. Overall, she was the go-between patients and health care providers (e.g., facilitate testing and other health care needs). Between 1997-1999,s she worked in a long-term nursing facility for assisted living (mostly older populations with Medicaid and Medicare) as a MDS coordinator. Her responsibilities included assessment and health care planning.   She was also involved in the continuity of care for patients and worked with occupational therapists, recreational therapists, social workers and physicians. She averaged a case load of about 35 patients.  \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation: Bring her in for an interview. Of note, she asked about actual program structure (e.g., what is the course name, competencies) and teaching load.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1187","CandID":"473","CommenterInitials":"WMS","DateOfComment":"2013-05-31T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant:  Victoria Soltis-Jarrett                                                      \t\t\t\tPosition:  PMHNP\n\nArea of Evaluation:\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage\n\nBook chapters x 3 (2010-2012); very good representation in peer reviewed journals including ANS.

There is no mention of courses taught. Her cover letter states that she has “taught in every course in the AND program with the exception of mental health nursing with recent experience in second level class and clinical. She has used Sakai and Blackboard.”\n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\nThe CV lists clinical practice as a nurse and family NP but no more detail than that. Her cover letter states that she works part time as a NP currently and is a second year DNP student that has started her capstone project in the family practice setting. \n\n5.\tService to the profession\nShe lists current and past membership in 5 professional organizations with no dates, so not sure what her current membership is. She is involved in many committees at the community college and has much community service listed on her CV. \n\n6.\tJob stability\nShe appears to have job stability- 5 years at her present position in the community college and 10 years with the same medical group as a FNP.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON\nShe could potentially function in the HPCC position as her clinical experience gives her the background and she does have experience in the higher education level. She lacks any experience teaching above a ADN degree and she does not currently have a doctoral degree. Her CV states an expected gradation from Duke’s DNP program on 5/2014. When I asked the E. Bloomer about when she will graduate, he relates that Dr. Turner expects her to defend 11/2013. \n\n\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  I am not sure about this candidate- she appears underqualified for a faculty position at DUSON and does not currently have a doctoral degree. My inclination would be to recommend to cease recruitment but we should probably discuss at the search committee meeting.

Among these, one is from NIH/NCI, the remaining are from Centers or Disease Prevention and Control, South Atlantic American Cancer Society, and one from UNC. Three grants are pending.  \n\n2.\tFocused program of research.  Her research focus is on cancer survivorship issues, such as addressing the needs of survivors as they transition from care to longer term survivorship. This includes providing them access to information via eHealth interventions. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She has taught several courses related to oncology nursing (e.g., advanced concepts in oncology nursing, advanced pharmacology in oncology nursing, cancer survivorship, etc.), applications of ehealth, primary care management of adults, and management of complex health problem in adults. She has chaired one dissertation committee and has served on six; she also has chaired 10 thesis/Masters projects, and was a member of three. She has worked with six postdoctoral fellows. Overall, her teaching evaluations are consistently between 4.5 to 5.0 on a five point scale, as self-reported in her “Essay for Promotion to Professor” (see p.4). \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice:   In the 80s and 90s, Dr. Mayer served as an oncology nurse specialist, staff nurse, nurse manager, chemotherapy nurse/nurse practitioner, and staff nurse. From 2000 to early 2003, she served as Chief Medical Offer for what appears to be a health service media company. She currently serves as a nurse practitioner in medical oncology in the Breast Program at the UNC Cancer Hospital while also serving on the steering committee on the UNC Lineberger Oncology Advanced Practice Providers.      \n\n5.\tService to the profession.  She is currently a member on eight professional organizations (e.g., American Academy of Nursing) and is or has served in numerous capacities to the Oncology Nursing Society, ONS foundation, NCI, ACS, and Southeastern Cancer Study Group – she has been on several advisory boards. Dr. Mayer has served or is serving as a journal reviewer, and is currently the Editor to the Clinical Journal of Oncology, Nursing. She has served as a grant reviewer (e.g., ONS). She currently serves on several committees at UNC (e.g., Faculty Counsel, UNC Survivorship Program Steering Committee) at the School the School of Nursing (e.g., Search Committee).  \n\n6.\tJob stability:  From 2007 until present she has been at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and prior to then, four years at Tufts University. Overall, she has had job stability.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Mayer can help substantially with teaching and clinical supervision of oncology nursing. She can also teach courses in informatics (e.g. , ehealth) and adult health. She has experiencing supervising Ph.D. students and chairing dissertation committees. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nDr.  Mayer has a strong publication record, it well recognized and respected, has mentored several students, appears to be an excellent instructor, and has contributed significantly to the field of oncology nursing in various capacities. If there are any concerns, it is that she has not obtained much external funding as a PI, especially in regards to NIH support. If a criterion to hire a senior level person is transferring established research funding, then this person does not qualify. However, given DUSON’s efforts to secure a senior level person in the area of oncology, the question is whether the Administration is willing to forego the above concern and interview her, given that she would like be competitive being promoted to Full Professor. I would suggest a follow-up phone interview based on the strong need to hire a more senior level person in oncology nursing.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1226","CandID":"488","CommenterInitials":"IL","DateOfComment":"2013-09-16T00:00:00","Comment":"Faculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :    Karen Aroian, Ph.D.                        \t\t\t\tPosition:   Senior Researcher\n\n Areas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Aroian is an Endowed Professor at the University of Central Florida. She has 53 peer review publications of which more than ½ are as first author. She has 12 extramural grants of which 7 are as PI. Among these 7, 3 are from NIH (e.g., NINR) – with the most recent from 2004-2009. She has numerous podium presentations and poster presentations. \n\n2.\tFocused program of research. Not exactly clear. It appears that her scholarly interests involve various racial and ethnic groups (e.g., Arab Muslims, Latin American Immigrant), that focus on adolescents, adults, and family relationships. Her research seems to involve oncology, issues of distress and social support, and heath care organizations. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  At the University of Florida she has taught qualitative research methods and supervised doctoral research and dissertations; she has been Chair to five doctoral students. At other universities, she has taught clinic practicums, measurement, stress and trauma, systems of therapy in psych, and advanced qualitative methods. Teaching evaluations were not provided. \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice:   Her clinical experience primarily occurred between 1977 and 1999. These positions included: clinical nurse specialist, per diem staff nurse, outpatient psychotherapist, group therapist, and assistant charge nurse.     \n\n5.\tService to the profession.  She is currently a member of three out of seven professional organizations (e.g., American Academy of Nursing) and serving on two editorial boards out of four listed.  She has been involved with several community organizations (e.g., grant reviewer currently with NIH study section on Culture) and has served as a consultant to various organizations – though 2006 was most recent. She has served on many university committees (e.g., APT, doctoral program committee, faculty affairs, University Research Counsel, etc.)\n\n6.\tJob stability:  From 2007 until present she has been at the University of Florida, Orlando. Prior to then, she was at Wayne State University for six years. Overall, she has had job stability.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Aroian can help with the teaching of mental health nursing, research methods, qualitative research methods, measurement and issues pertaining to culture. She has experiencing supervising Ph.D. students and chairing dissertation committees. \n\n\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nDr.  Aroian clearly has accomplishment much, as evidenced by having an endowed professorship. Would like to know more about teaching evaluations and get a better sense of type of research she does. Also, within the last few years, she has not been as productive getting external funding, especially from NIH as PI. I would like to know more about her plans for future grants and level of productivity getting grants. If she did come to DUSON, it appears she would not be bringing much external funding. As such, it would be worthwhile to inquire as to how quickly she could establish her research here and what resources she would need. Suggest a follow-up phone interview.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1227","CandID":"476","CommenterInitials":"09/11/13","DateOfComment":"2013-09-17T00:00:00","Comment":"From: Lisa Day \nSent: Wednesday, September 11, 2013 12:37 PM\nTo: Allison Vorderstrasse; Brigit Carter, Ph.D.; Crystal Arthur; Isaac Lipkus Reiner, Ph.D.; Michael Scott; Robin Knobel; Wanda Bradshaw\nSubject: followup with PMHNP candidate\n\nHi, All, \nI did a f/u with Dr. Cox on her plans for completing national certification as a PMHNP.

(If they are currently in a position)\nShe is interested in Duke because of Marilyn Hockenberry’s idea of a nursing oncology center for excellence. She has been at UNC since 2007 and there has not been a big opportunity to pull together with other researchers for a bigger picture approach- she feels that this opportunity will do that. She feels that this is her last big Hurrah before retiring and she would like to make a difference. She intends to step down as editor of Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing this year and wants to devote more time to research and mentoring.\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nShe said oncology transcends organizations so it doesn’t matter where she is- she has known colleagues at Duke for a long time- she mentioned Brenda N. and Sue S. She said she moved down from the northeast in 2007 and has loved UNC which is a very good cancer center. (She never really answered why Duke except in the previous question)- I asked her was there anything else she liked about Duke but she didn’t answer.\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nShe is very experienced with various different backgrounds- she has a long clinical career, has been CEO of her own company, has always been involved in cancer nursing, has held every position in the oncology nursing society, has been a nurse manager, cns, lived and worked in Canada. She has a health policy perspective. She has the ability to zoom in and zoom out to the big picture and go back and forth. \n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nGetting over committed, learning to say no, prioritizing what to accept and what not to accept. She said she is also impatient. \n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nHer daughter first. After than would be her contributions to the field- ONS president, ability to be amazed by opportunities and take advantage of them. \n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size\nb.\tClinical groups\nc.\tOnline\nShe has taught mostly in the undergraduate program and NP programs. She has a leadership position with the DNP program. She has mentored graduate, doctoral and post doctoral students. She likes mentoring curiosity and teaching students how to think on their feet. She has taught using the flipped classroom, large and small classrooms. She has evaluated her teaching with formative evaluation. \n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nShe said her interests are with cancer care, health services research with big data sets, ehealth initiatives, and the health policy nightmare with survivor care plans. She said she has never had an R01 and entered her PhD program late- graduated in 2006. She had written a recent R01 but has turned it into an R21 and it will be reviewed in October. She has had an R01 equivalent by being co-PI on a P50. She has a current pilot study underway. \n9.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nShe currently practices ½ day per week in the breast cancer survivor’s clinic as a NP. She said she wasn’t sure she wanted to continue practicing and that could be discussed. \n10.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. NA\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation: I am not sure that this candidate fits the “senior researcher” candidate profile. I was impressed by reviewing her documents alone, but much less impressed after talking with her. She does not really seem to be focused on research – but more focused on clinical aspects of oncology. She has not had her PhD that long and she mentioned she went to an online PhD program. When I tried to discuss research grants, funding, and direction, she seemed to minimize that aspect of the conversation. It does not appear that she would bring funding with her position and she only has an R21 pending.  \nI recommend recruitment for another position if she fits, but just not a senior researcher position.

As a doctoral student at Yale University School of Nursing, she developed the Frailty Index for Elders (FIFE), a holistic instrument to identify older adults as frail or at risk for frailty. Her postdoctoral fellowship has concentrated on further psychometric testing of FIFE and dissemination of her research. Her future research plans are to examine the effects of nursing interventions to prevent and minimize frailty.  Her ultimate aim is to participate in interdependent collaborative research to prevent and manage frailty to maintain older adults in the community.\n\nShe received a Hartford Building Academic Gerontological Nursing Capacity Scholarship and co-developed a Geriatric Primary Home Care Program and a Geriatric Resource Nurse Program (through Nursing Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders) at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, CT. These programs were developed to enhance nurses’ knowledge and skill in caring for hospitalized older adults and to expand primary care to frail elders living in the community.   She has active membership in the national Gero organization to enhance learn leadership skills and promote gerontological nursing. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs\n\nHer teaching roles have included Coordinator of the Geriatric Nurse Practitioner Specialty, program instructor, and lecturer in the Adult, Family, Gerontology, and Women’s Health Primary Care Specialty at Yale University School of Nursing. The courses she taught have focused on common and complex health problems of older adults. She has incorporated a variety of teaching strategies in her courses primarily emphasizing an interactive approach through case studies and discussion on individualizing evidence-based practice to meet the needs of the diverse older adult population. She makes a point in her cover letter that she strives to provide an environment for students to express themselves freely, incorporate critical thinking, and to consider the needs of older adults within healthcare, social, historical, and political contexts.\n\nShe has been lead faculty for Physical Assessment and Gero courses for 5 yrs at Yale and 3 years at Southern CT State Univ.

She does not specify the number of students she has mentored, but her teaching experience runs over 10 years, so it would seem plausible that she has mentored many nursing students in Gero NP speciality. \n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\n\nHer clinical expertise is also strong and very focused on Gero patient care.  She was a staff nurse for 8 yrs, a Gero NP for at least 10 yrs and continues to practice clinically at the Fairfield Co. Senior Center.  She ran a Gero Resource nurse program at Bridgeport Hospital for 3 yrs.  Also her clinical experience shows at least 2 years in administrative positions. \n\n6.\tService to the profession\n\nHer CV shows a commitment to Service since 1999 by participation on following committees: \n\nUniversity School of Nursing Executive Committee\nCurriculum Committee\n\tAd Hoc Task Force on Teaching and Learning\n\tAd Hoc Task Force on Course Evaluations\nMember of the Evercare Medical Advisory Committee, Hartford, CT, April 2005-September 2007.\n\nNursing Auditor for South Central Connecticut Agency on Aging Home Care, New\nMember of The Centenarians Committee; South Central Connecticut Agency on Aging, West Haven, CT., November, 2000 – 2001.\n\nMember of Board of Directors; South Central Connecticut Agency on Aging, West Haven, CT., October, 1999 – 2001.\n\n7.\tJob stability\n\nShe shows a very stable pattern of living & working in the New Haven, CT area.

Short term, to find a stable place, conduct research, and have a chance to express his interest in teaching.  Overall, he wants more of an academic environment that has interaction among faculty. Long term he is planning to continue research. He hopes to establish a research center where several people can interact and share interests as well as provide support for faculty and students.   \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Overall, the department he is in has a different agenda than his own (policy and objectives have changed). He is not getting support for what he is trying to do. [Details are provided under the question as to why he left Kent State at the bottom]. \n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  More interested in an academic setting. Duke University seems to present this setting. Always wanted to work within medical academic fields.  Has seen this kind of research and likes it. \n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths? Have a passion for teaching and research. He does consulting a lot and considers it a part of teaching.  Has a good solid background in research methodology, especially in multilevel analyses.  Has been exposed to people with different fields and hence has been exposed to different research. Overall, he is focused more on research and consulting. \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses? Need to be more exposed to other fields and technologies (e.g., new software to conduct research and analyses). \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment? When working in the private sector, he got involved in a major project funded from the National Health Institute.  He adjourned a meeting of researcher and found a major fault in how they were conducting the research (e.g., comparing treatment vs. treatment rather than treatment vs. control). Once recognized, he was able to develop a way of distinguishing treatments and devise a method to show effects of the intervention (i.e., treatments). \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size:  When teaching basic and intermediate statistics, he generally favors between 20 to 30 students. With a specialty/advanced class (e.g., multivariate, multilevel), prefers around 10 students. He really thinks that interaction is with  students is key, especially for more advanced courses.\nb.\tClinical groups: No general preference as long as they have preference in the material. He has taught students from various disciplines such as psychology, education, computer science, nursing, and communication.  Sat on Master and Ph.D. committees – found psychology students were more interested in research.  \nc.\tOnline: He did teach online when he was at Kent State. Has no problem with it (used Blackboard though not his preference). He taught night class and found students to be tired; online may be helpful to these students.  \nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy. Considers teaching is an art that consists of two parts: having a mastery of the subject and the art of delivering the information.  For him, teaching is a way of preserving and dissemination knowledge in a way that is well done; this is his philosophy. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans? Multilevel analyses and its applications. Develop some methods calculating effect sizes for single subject designs. Hopes to collaborate with other faculty. \n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA\n\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? NA\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nA.\tWhy did you leave Kent State? Program changed direction in many ways. He was not getting enough support for conducting research (e.g., could not get a student, had conflict of interests with Chair of Program). He was teaching all the advanced courses in statistics, but many students were not interested in these. Could not find many faculty within the department of education to collaborate with. Although he tried to collaborate with others outside his Department, this still was problematic. Program overall was small.  \nB.\tWhy was he not promoted to associate professor?  He did submit his application packet for Associate Professor but was not granted the promotion.  He thinks the reason for not being promoted was political (e.g., conflict of interest with the Chair). The feedback he received was that he was not active enough if the Department of Education. They asked him to leave.  \nC.\t Why no peer reviewed publications after 2005. Has a 2013 peer reviewed article.\n \nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:  This is not an easy decision. However, I would recommend inviting him to campus for the following reasons. First, he has a strong evidence of statistical expertise and application that can serve both DUSON students and faculty. Second, he seems to enjoy teaching and the student interaction and has taught numerous courses. My main concern is the lack of promotion from Assistant to Associate and the reason for it. Minor concerns were his teaching philosophy (e.g,. Emphasis on how knowledge is conveyed) and what he considered to be his major achievement (i.e, no focus on interaction with students). Overall, he demeanor over the phone was calm.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1268","CandID":"510","CommenterInitials":"IL","DateOfComment":"2014-01-23T00:00:00","Comment":"CONFIDENTIAL\nFaculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :    Samereh Abdoli, Ph.D.                        \t\t\t\tPosition:   Senior Researcher\n\n Areas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage.  Dr. Abdoli is an Assistant Professor of Nursing at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Iran. She has 30 paper publications of which 18 are as first author. She has 33 paper/poster presentations. Although there is mention of being involved on different research grants in the cover letter, it is not clear what role she had, type of grant(s), amount of funding, and which grants are active, if any.  \n\n2.\tFocused program of research.  Her research is focused on diabetes management and stigma. Her future research is aimed at “exploring empowerment and diabetes related stigma in a multicultural context and developing questionnaires to measure diabetes-related stigma and empowerment…” \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She has taught sampling in medical research and statistical methods in medical research.  These courses were taught over 10 years ago (2004). She has also taught advanced research methods and qualitative research methods.  There are no teaching evaluations. \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice:    Not clear.

Dr.  Abdoli can contribute to teaching research methods, qualitative methods, sampling and statistical methods. However, details about statistical methods are lacking.  She can also contribute to courses that involve endocrinology. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nDr.  Abdoli has a strong publication record at this stage of her career, has mentored nursing students, and has an active area of scholarship in diabetes and stigma. However, in the cover letter and CV there is very little information as to what her skills are as a statistician (e.g. details about methods of statistics), how she has collaborated/consulted with faculty as a statistician, and her reasons for wanting to pursue a position as a statistician.  My recommendation is not to pursue a phone screen.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1269","CandID":"510","CommenterInitials":"KW","DateOfComment":"2014-01-24T00:00:00","Comment":"Confidential\nApplicant :      Samereh Abdoli       \t\t\t \nPosition:  Asst Prof Track III\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)\nUnclear about whether she has had funding or what type of funding from CV & cover letter.

Honor graduate. MSN thesis was on osteoporosis in menopausal women. Has 23 first/second author papers and 6 other author papers in mostly European or Iranian journals. \n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship\nHer primary research goal is directed towards understanding the concept of empowerment in living with diabetes. She is also focused on identity and stigma in diabetes as a chronic disease.  Her future research plans are aimed at exploring empowerment and diabetes related stigma in a multicultural context and developing questionnaires to measure diabetes-related stigma and empowerment as well; with an ultimate aim in developing an anti-stigma program to overcome chronic-disease related stigma and facilitate empowerment process in people living with chronic diseases.  She was selected as the distinguished researcher two years in a row in 2011 and 2012 by her university. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs\nHer experiences include teaching physical assessment, med-surg nursing, qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods research. A course she describes as “Endocrinology/cardiology” has been her main teaching responsibility, but she has taught & mentored students at undergraduate and graduate (MS & PhD) levels—unclear if these were all nursing or from other disciplines. In addition, she has involved undergraduate students in writing research proposals, gaining grants and presenting the results in national and international journals and conferences.\n\n4.\tMentorship experience congruent with position’s needs\nOther than the students mentioned above, and 4 PhD student dissertations she describes in her CV, no other specific mentoring mentioned. \n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\nUnclear \n\n6.\tService to the profession\nShe is member of ICN, and has served on numerous university committees at both Arak University and Isfahan University.

Just doesn’t seem to fit together.\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  \n\nI would say that although she has a great publication and service record, I am not sure about her research funding or ability to get same once in U.S.  And seems odd that she is trained as midwife, researching stigma of diabetes, and now interested in teaching research and stats.

Doesn’t want to leave clinical practice and thinks Duke would be supportive of him teaching and practicing clinically. He identifies himself as a junior faculty, and doesn’t know much about curriculum development. Long term goal would like to gain these skills and develop mastery of the teaching role. Interested in faculty based clinic. \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\n\nHas not had a faculty position before, but likes clinical practice. Was in Durham last month and the reputation of Duke is excellent. He states he is moving along in his Pscyh NP program. Interested in teaching in the MSN or DNP programs. Wants an institution that will mentor him, and allow him to mentor students.\n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \n\nHe answered this question in the two above questions. Basically, Duke has a great reputation and he thinks it would be a supportive environment.\n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\n\nLikes to engage students in learning rather than memorization. He is able to identify his own learning needs and says he’s not afraid to say, “I don’t know”. Encourages feedback from students when he serves as a NP preceptor and wants a rationale for all of their answers. Believes in questioning care provided and individualizing care.\n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\n\nJunior faculty and not much experience lecturing. Has filled in for other faculty for guest lectures only. He has no experience with curriculum development. He used to be flexible with deadlines for students, but now tries to adhere to deadlines to avoid overworking himself at the end of a semester (“sometimes I am too nice”)\n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\n\nMost proud of his work at FIU in the free clinic, it was an “eye opening” experience, and he loved that job. Got to work with a very diverse population (people devastated by war, lost everything, and had to adjust to life in America). Enjoyed the psych aspect of his job at the clinic. He wanted to understand their experiences, rather than just prescribe medications. Also proud of completing BSN to PhD program.\n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? \n\nLikes psych, but also like physiology. Like to know the rationale with neurophysiology and neuropsychology.  Thinks these topics are like putting the pieces of a puzzle together, and likes students to think of how one thing leads to another (gave me an Adams Family  analysis that I didn’t quite understand the link to the question I asked him)\n\na.\tClass size – has only taught in classes of 50-100 students\n\nb.\tClinical groups – has worked with clinical groups of 8-10 students, prefers 8 to a group. “When there are 10, I have to find the places to hide to find the students”\n\nc.\tOnline – very limited online teaching experience, more related to online student evaluations. No online course development experience.\n\nD.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy – doesn’t have a formal teaching philosophy, but says basically, he doesn’t believe in memorization. He encourages inquisitiveness, getting students to be excited about learning. Knowledge improves and changes over time. Students should learn to always have a certain level of discomfort, as a motivating factor to question things. Likes to get students to talk aloud about their thinking process/ rationale, rather than just providing an answer. (then he went on a little side conversation about the Civil War) \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\n\nSubstance abuse and adolescence. Interested in the neuroscience of addiction. Previous research delved into how adolescents devalued their futures, and their interaction with providers. Has not published his dissertation results yet, as the study is ongoing and will not be complete until the end of this year. He is currently writing up the preliminary results.\n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nn/a\n\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\n\nPractice interest is Psych, and is eligible to sit for certification in May. He will do so, and plans to maintain FNP and Psych certifications. Says ultimately, he would like to blend both to work in community/ public health/ underserved clinic.\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nThere weren’t any questions for him specifically that I saw. His questions to me were about mentorship for teaching, and is looking for clinical track position.\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\n\nHe seems like a friendly person, and was very focused on clinical practice and teaching. These are the two things he primarily wants to do, but did indicate that he wouldn’t mind working with a research team.  He is going to need a lot of support to develop as an educator as his CV reflects, and as he points out. No experience in curriculum development or course development in any venue (classroom or online). He does have clinical precepting experience, and clinical experience with groups of 8-10 nursing students. He is currently in Arkansas completing clinical hours for his Psych NP degree, and will move from Florida this summer. His ideal start time if successful in obtaining interview and position at Duke would be late summer or fall of 2014.\n\nThe focus he articulated would make him a candidate for a clinical track assistant professor, in either the Master’s or DNP program, but he will be essentially brand new to academia and teaching. Not sure of program needs in order to make a recommendation, but he didn’t strike me overall as a super strong candidate for the FNP or Psych positions. Maybe an interview would help tease that out?","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1273","CandID":"508","CommenterInitials":"PT","DateOfComment":"2014-02-01T00:00:00","Comment":"Phone interview: 1-31-14\n1.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position? \nShort term: Dr. Thompson has been a consultant with DUSON since 2009 teaching stats in the MS program and consulting with a very large number of our DNP students to assist with oversight of their statistical analysis.

Duke is a very prestigious institution and she has enjoyed working at Duke as a consultant. She believes due is the ideal setting  to pursue an academic career. \n4.\tWhat are your strengths?

Prelims: extra paper on stats\nStrengths in analytic methods: quantitative, group comparisons, anovas. But comfortable with all advanced stats, including analysis of longitudinal data. \nWeaknesses: qualitative methods\n\nClarify her expected role with DNP students: Dr. Thompson discussed some current frustration with working with DNP students at somewhat of a disadvantage as a consultant vs. a faculty member. She believes she should NOT run the statistics for students, however, she is asked by some capstone advisors to run the stats for the student, and thus she has felt pressure to do it from the student and advisor, at times. By not being a faculty member, she is unsure of policies and does not have the opportunity to always interact with faculty. For example, she was not aware of the ability to use Mediasite sessions as options for students in her online classes, or other basic resources that could help her work with the MS and DNP students. She would like to continue to teach stats and attend the program committee meetings and serve on DNP capstone committes as appropriate. She would like to be more involved in the faculty role with students.  \n\nElaborate on past role with DNP students in regards to mentoring. Verify 12 pubs with students? \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale: Pursue active onsite interviews and obtain references.

Mostly, my role has been helping students choose the correct statistical test and understand the SPSS output. I also have helped a lot with G Power analysis and presentation techniques (tables, bar charts, run charts, etc). \n\nI am unsure what it means by \"verify\" the 12 pubs with students. In certain circumstances, the student had a very difficult time with the interpretation and write up of the results. Given that I have helped over 100 students with some DNP Capstone aspect, this is a small number. But, when my role included the actual statistical analysis and write up, which created a \"considerable and significant contribution to the manuscript\" I was then given distant authorship.

In the short term, she plans building on her dissertation and post-doctoral opportunities with 2-4 research studies as her “next steps”.  Her long term career goals are: (1) research intensive career as faculty member in research based School of Nsg, (2) interdisciplinary collaborations in the community and wider university, (3) b/c she is junior research, it is important to have access to strong gero research mentors, and other gero related colleagues on campus outside of the School of Nsg. \n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nFinishing her post-doc fellowship in August 2014, and next step in launching her research career is a full time faculty position as Assistant Professor.  \n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nLooked at many schools who have national presence with Hartford Scholar program, strong senior faculty research gero mentors who have published in that field, and opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration at medical center and Pepper Center, the literature demonstrates that there are many Gero researchers at Duke University doing translational research work.\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\n•\tNumerous years in clinical practice of elderly.\n•\tGreat mentorship as beginning researcher.  Learned so much being part of bigger multidisciplinary research team.  \n•\tInstrument development experience of questionnaire development measuring concept of frailty in elderly.  Mentors have taught her to focus on details of project and she has succeeded in completing successful research study of dissertation and instrument development. \n•\tAware of fact that although she has had great mentors and great research experiences, she is still junior faculty and admits she will need further mentoring.\n•\tPost doc has given her the opportunity to see slightly bigger picture of program of research than just the first study (her dissertation). \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\n•\tFact that she is junior faculty who will need mentoring especially as she moves on to next study with development of interventions.\n•\tWill need guidance as she enters new university culture to lean about culture at DUSON, the new culture of care of older adults in Durham, and culture of Duke University.\n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nAlong w/ Geriatrician, co-initiated primary care clinic for frail elderly in community. Also development of the Frailty Index for Elders (FIE) tool. \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?  Teaching Gero nursing course in MSN program\na.\tClass size—20-30, like getting to know each student individually, love  the dialogue  and interactions with students to adjust her teaching style to meet their individual learning styles and needs.   Has taught up to 90 students at one time in her physical assessment  classes. \nb.\tClinical groups—certainly can do that after my years of experience, but not sure how that works with multiple Gero NP students doing rotations in different parts of the country.  Really loves the Gero seminars to meet with students to debrief cases after their clinical rotations.\nc.\tOnline—know very little about online teaching techniques, but know this is the wave of the future and interested to learn.\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy—I know that all students learn differently with different styles of learning and at different paces.  I feel it is important to learn about my students and tailor my want of teaching to individual student needs.  I enjoy seeing the moments when students finally catch on to a difficult topic or concept. She asked about the IEE teaching fellowship and was very interested to hear that DUSON values mentoring for excellence in teaching as much as we value excellence in research.  \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?  \nCandidate’s research interest is to have a research intensive career as faculty member in research based School of Nsg, with  interdisciplinary collaborations in the community and wider university.  She has ideas for next 22-4 studies with maybe one more descriptive project before moving on to intervention research project.  \n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nN/A\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\nCurrently practicing one day/week (Wed afternoons) during post-doc.  And she feels it would be important to do same here in Durham to learn the Gero environment in NC.  She is certified as ZNCC and would be interested in keeping that certification.   Currently works w/ Epic EMR in her current job, so was pleased to hear that Duke uses Epic system as well. \n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nShe is on target to finish her post-doc fellowship in Aug 2014 and would be able to move that month to start new position in Fall 2014.  \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nCandidate was very well prepared for questions, had thoughtful answers and definitely ideas for developing her program of research and a strong track record of potentially fundable projects.  Her program of research seems to be a good fit for DUSON, her interests in teaching Gero & physical assessment seem to meet our needs for faculty in those courses, and she seemed very interested in learning online teaching techniques. Would recommend that she be invited to campus for interview.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1276","CandID":"511","CommenterInitials":"BC","DateOfComment":"2014-02-11T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :      Ying Liu            \t\t\t Position:  \n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity.\nCurrently CO PI on 3 RO1s (2 are pending renewal), PI on R03, \nPublications: Graduated with PhD in 2008; publication minimal until 2012 however has had 15 pubs since then and 5 currently in review.

Dr. Bainbridge has five journal publications, none as first or senior author. He has two oral and two poster presentations, none as first or senior author.   He has four technical reports and lists 8 publications in which he provided statistical consulting and data analytic services. He is currently on two grants – he is not the PI. He was also on one other grant. He has contributed to grant and contract proposals in health care and other fields within both academia and industry. Note that he is due to receive his DrPH In biostatistics, May 2014.\n\n2.\tFocused program of research. His research interests – as expressed in the cover letter – are in the areas of health services with a general focus on quality improvement. He has worked with the analyses of large datasets (e.g., SEER Medicare data), and has both experience and expertise in such areas as experimental design and research methodology, within and between subject designs in behavioral research, survey design and general psychometrics     \n\n3.\tTeaching experience.  While he was a Lewis and Clark College, he taught introductory Statistics and the Research Methods sequence; however, this was a while back (1994-1995). As a graduate student at the University of Oregon he served as teaching assistant for two classes, although it is not clear that they were statistical courses. No teaching evaluations were provided.\n\n4.\tMentorship experience. He states in his cover letter, that he has “mentored students at the undergraduate, masters, and doctoral levels, as a committee member at Lewis and Clark College, in SAS programming associated with the M.P.H. at Harvard, and in analysis of SEER-Medicare data for the Health Policy Management program at UNC.” His industry experience includes mentoring junior programmers.   \n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice.  NA\n\n6.\tService to the profession.  He is a member of three organizations: American Statistical Association,  \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncologists, and the International Association for Statistical Education. He has also provided SEER-Medicare data mentoring for PhD students at UNC in Health Policy Management Program using this data for their dissertations (2009-2011). There is no evidence that he served as a journal or grant reviewer. Aside from this, he provides statistical consulting, including for a nursing faculty member at UNC, in such areas as Design of Experiments, Research Methods, Generalized Linear Mixed Models, Nonparametrics, Sampling, Data Analysis, Modeling & Simulation, Statistical Process Control, and Metrics.\n\n7.\tJob stability. No concerns. During the last 10 years or so he has been involved in statistical programming and analyses at several locations. For example, from October 2012 until now, he works as a Biostatistician III, in the Immunology Quality Assurance program Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University. Prior to that, he largest stint of employment  (December 2005 – March 2011) was as a  Applications Analyst, at the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \n\n8.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON. Dr. Bainbridge can contribute to teaching introductory and perhaps advanced research methods and statistical courses to a wide range of students. For example, as he states, he has used such analytical tools that include: OLS, ML, REML and GEE based techniques; procedures included Proc GLM, Genmod, Mixed, and GLIMMIX; he can also help with multilevel and longitudinal generalized linear mixed models using MLE. He also brings research expertise in cancer and in the analyses of large datasets. \n \n9.\tQuestions for candidate.  Would like to know about the following areas:\n1.\tHow much experience he has working with academic faculty and in what capacity.\n2.\tIn what ways has he contributed to grant submissions.\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  He seems a promising candidate, with a wealth of experience doing statistical consulting. However, is it not clear what his experience is with working with faculty in general and specifically on grant proposals. I would suggest doing a phone screen to obtain more in-depth information about these issues.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1280","CandID":"511","CommenterInitials":"RBK","DateOfComment":"2014-02-17T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant : Ying Liu                 \t\t\t Position: Statistican \n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity.\nThe applicant is a clinical assistant professor in the school of dentistry in University of Missouri-Kansas City, MO, holding a PhD in Statistics.

Short term, to find a stable place, conduct research, and have a chance to express his interest in teaching.  Overall, he wants more of an academic environment that has interaction among faculty. Long term he is planning to continue research. He hopes to establish a research center where several people can interact and share interests as well as provide support for faculty and students.   \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position). Overall, the department he is in has a different agenda than his own (policy and objectives have changed). He is not getting support for what he is trying to do. [Details are provided under the question as to why he left Kent State at the bottom]. \n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  More interested in an academic setting. Duke University seems to present this setting. Always wanted to work within medical academic fields.  Has seen this kind of research and likes it. \n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths? Have a passion for teaching and research. He does consulting a lot and considers it a part of teaching.  Has a good solid background in research methodology, especially in multilevel analyses.  Has been exposed to people with different fields and hence has been exposed to different research. Overall, he is focused more on research and consulting. \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses? Need to be more exposed to other fields and technologies (e.g., new software to conduct research and analyses). \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment? When working in the private sector, he got involved in a major project funded from the National Health Institute.  He adjourned a meeting of researcher and found a major fault in how they were conducting the research (e.g., comparing treatment vs. treatment rather than treatment vs. control). Once recognized, he was able to develop a way of distinguishing treatments and devise a method to show effects of the intervention (i.e., treatments). \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size:  When teaching basic and intermediate statistics, he generally favors between 20 to 30 students. With a specialty/advanced class (e.g., multivariate, multilevel), prefers around 10 students. He really thinks that interaction is with  students is key, especially for more advanced courses.\nb.\tClinical groups: No general preference as long as they have preference in the material. He has taught students from various disciplines such as psychology, education, computer science, nursing, and communication.  Sat on Master and Ph.D. committees – found psychology students were more interested in research.  \nc.\tOnline: He did teach online when he was at Kent State. Has no problem with it (used Blackboard though not his preference). He taught night class and found students to be tired; online may be helpful to these students.  \nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy. Considers teaching is an art that consists of two parts: having a mastery of the subject and the art of delivering the information.  For him, teaching is a way of preserving and dissemination knowledge in a way that is well done; this is his philosophy. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans? Multilevel analyses and its applications. Develop some methods calculating effect sizes for single subject designs. Hopes to collaborate with other faculty. \n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? NA\n\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? NA\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nA.\tWhy did you leave Kent State? Program changed direction in many ways. He was not getting enough support for conducting research (e.g., could not get a student, had conflict of interests with Chair of Program). He was teaching all the advanced courses in statistics, but many students were not interested in these. Could not find many faculty within the department of education to collaborate with. Although he tried to collaborate with others outside his Department, this still was problematic. Program overall was small.  \nB.\tWhy was he not promoted to associate professor?  He did submit his application packet for Associate Professor but was not granted the promotion.  He thinks the reason for not being promoted was political (e.g., conflict of interest with the Chair). The feedback he received was that he was not active enough if the Department of Education. They asked him to leave.  \nC.\t Why no peer reviewed publications after 2005. Has a 2013 peer reviewed article.\n \nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:  This is not an easy decision. However, I would recommend inviting him to campus for the following reasons. First, he has a strong evidence of statistical expertise and application that can serve both DUSON students and faculty. Second, he seems to enjoy teaching and the student interaction and has taught numerous courses. My main concern is the lack of promotion from Assistant to Associate and the reason for it. Minor concerns were his teaching philosophy (e.g,. Emphasis on how knowledge is conveyed) and what he considered to be his major achievement (i.e, no focus on interaction with students). Overall, he demeanor over the phone was calm.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1288","CandID":"513","CommenterInitials":"WTB","DateOfComment":"2014-03-01T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :    Colleen McLaughlin              \t\t\t Position:  FNP (PNP consideration)\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity.\n•\t9 peer reviewed journal articles: 1 as first author, 4 as second\n•\t5 abstracts: 1 as first author\n•\t1 editorial (first author)\n•\t1 in press as first author (with DUSON faculty: Hockenberry, Hueckel, & Docherty)\n•\tJournals include J of Emergency Nursing, J of Neurosurgery, Pediatrics, Pediatric Neurosurgery, British Journal of Neurosurgery, J of Clinical Oncology, J of Pediatric Psychology, J of Neuro-oncology; Transfusion\n\n•\tResearch funding information not available\n\n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship\n•\tDNP capstone: Standardization of Healthcare Provider Competencies for Intrathecal Access Procedures  \n•\tDean’s Award, MSN University of Alabama at Birmingham\n•\tPediatrics; stem cell research for genetic and acquired brain disorders\n\n\n3.\tTeaching experience \n•\tClinical Associate, Duke University School of Nursing: preceptor  (2007-present)\n•\tClass presentations for DUSON PNP/NNP students (neurological system)\n•\tEducation session for DUMC NPs and RNs (neuro-imaging of white matter disorders; brain tumors)\n\n\n4.\tMentorship experience \nInformation not available\n\n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\n•\tCertified Pediatric Nurse Practitioner – Primary Care (CPNP-PC)  (1999-2015)  \n•\tDNP Nurse Consultant – newly formed company starting up with goal of producing on-line quality healthcare simulation modules\n•\tPediatric ICU RN; nurse clinician – neurosurgery; PNP – neurosurgery; PNP – brain tumor center;\nAssistant Director of Advanced Practice (Duke); PNP – blood and narrow transplant (Duke)\n\n6.\tService to the profession\n•\tDuke University: Institutional Review Board: Primary Reviewer\t (2005-present)\n•\tScientific Reviewer – Friends of Nursing / Nursing Research Council Small Grant Applications – March 2013\n•\tMember: National Association of Pediatric Nurses and Practitioners; member: Association of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurses\n\n7.\tJob stability\nNo issues.

Long term goal is to be 100% researcher (funded by other’s grants as well as his own)  in the area of Health Policy and Social Science. \n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nCurrent position is a staff position doing statistics for faculty and only rarely with students.  His interation with students is explaining results and he wants to be involved earlier in the statistical process and on committees with PhD students.  So b/c his current job offers little face to face  interaction w/ students, doctoral committee work, and participating in faculty research from the beginning of the project, he would like to change positions.

And has strong interest in areas of Health Policy, Clinical research, and social science, which the DUSON position affords him.

Feels he could teach MSN stats course very easily face to face, but may need help or teaching assistant if required to teach online.  Also has no experience working as member of doctoral committee or being PI on his own grant.\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nHelping the School of Pub Policy faculty develop process for data management and analysis.  He has initiated process of helping faculty bring him in at the beginning of writing grants, helps with planning design, analysis, variables, etc.  Then with data management helps faculty in building databases, creating new variables, discussion of how to address missing data issues.  He does all the data prep & analysis  in SAS.  Then uses STATA to do model runs or additional analysis and organizes outcome in STATA b/c that is what faculty are more comfortable with.  \n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size—prefers small classes such as 10-15.  \nb.\tClinical groups—N/A\nc.\tOnline—has not taught online previously but is willing to learn.

Informal teaching has included one on one statistical consultation with faculty or PhD students. \n(b) Dr. Bai has had no grants submitted or funded as the PI, but would like to do this in the future.\n(c)  Dr. Bai has been on no PhD student committees as committee member or Chair.\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nAlthough Dr. Bai has strong positives in his experience with multiple high level statistical methods, knowledge of multiple statistical software programs, and background in clinical medicine, I would recommend no further recruitment efforts at this time due to his lack of teaching experience, lack of independent research, and lack of publications regarding those higher level statistical methods.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1294","CandID":"520","CommenterInitials":"mba","DateOfComment":"2014-03-10T00:00:00","Comment":"Faculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :   Amber Hackstadt               \t\t\t Position:  Statistician\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)\n\nHas one manuscript as first author (2009), and one as second author (2011).

Her current ABSN program is marketed toward working students. She realizes our program and students will be different.\n\nLong term:  Improve her pedagogical skills and engage in more scholarly work. Dr. Brennan-Cook acknowledges with her current and past very heavy course load and teaching responsibilities it has been difficult to engage in more scholarly work. However, she expressed a very strong desire. We discussed the Institute for Educational Excellence and she was very enthusiastic about working with them. She would also like to engage in some research. She tried to initiate a pilot project last summer with students. The aim was to engage students in using a pedometer and recording diet and study activities. She spoke with passion about this project and would love to be able to start this up again with more focus. \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position, and why now? (If they are currently in a position)  Husband has been commuting for 4 years and lives in Raleigh. They have a family and children are in NY with Jill. It has become too much and Jill is now ready to move and very excited about the possibility. \n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  Jill contacted Dr. Zychowicz about a potential faculty position. At that time, a position was not posted. There was a simulation staff position available. She decided to go ahead and apply because she really does want to move to the area and loves simulation. She actually interviewed for the position and was on campus last week. Another individual was chosen. In the interim, this faculty position became available and she is applying. She has also met and spoken with Margie Malloy and another faculty who strongly encouraged her to apply for this faculty position. During her visit, she was very impressed with DUSON and the faculty. She feels DUSON has a lot to offer including being a very strong program and the faculty seem open to new ideas. \n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths? \n\nA.\tVery organized. She discussed that you can set the bar high if you are organized and very clear with the students regarding your expectations. She believes in being clear and consistent.  \nB.\tEnjoyed teaching fundamentals this past year. She discussed her strengths as being a very dynamic, enthusiastic and excellent educator. She states she is comfortable teaching any course. She incorporates her extensive clinical experience into her teaching. I was most impressed by this statement: “You must realize you essentially work for them, you are never better than them”.  She believes in teaching from a caring and compassionate standpoint. \nC.\tTeam player, works well with others, willing to try new things, open up, energetic. \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?  Naïve, too trusting. Not always politically savvy. “I just do the work.” She gave an example of others taking credit for some work and large projects she did.  \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?  I have been able to do whatever has been asked. She described their program as being small originally and then the program underwent rapid growth. She was asked to take on new courses and responsibilities. She felt she was always very successful in these tasks. \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? Love getting in a classroom, identifying with the students, and making sure that they learn.” If you see blank faces, you are not doing your job. I like to engage students.” Engages students, become an active learner. Own part of the learning process. Telling stories about clinical scenarios and bring back to the message. Her passion and enthusiasm for teaching was so evident.\nA.\tClass size: stats: 30:1, but 110 students in skills with 4 sections, 3 instructors. He is responsible for coordinating all instructors and students;  25 students come to the lab every day. \nB.\tClinical groups: 8 students to 1 instructor. In her clinical settings, she usually takes the primary responsibility for working with the students. She has students in the long term care setting, often with only 1 RN for the facility. She also works with RN’s on the unit as well and sometimes the RNs take more responsibility for the students. \nC.\tOnline: Have taught fully online nutrition course for RN’s. Comfortable. Still likes face to face better. Understands need setting everything set up correctly and anticipate student needs with an online course. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?  “If you look at my CV you will see there is nothing there”. She expressed a strong desire to have some program of research, mostly educational research and publications. She has been unable to find time; currently in addition to teaching she has 50 advisees this semester. Her interests are in evaluating  student learning and outcomes, the way we teach. She would like to start pedometer project again. She also facilitated a student research practicum over the summer and enjoyed it.  \n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? Did not publish due to lack of time.\n\n\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests? Still love the clinical setting and have had strong role. Love working in the hospital, she is a RN, not NP and does not have a particular desire to have a specific faculty role. But, she is very interested in maintaining her practice in the clinical sites with students. \n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members. Mentoring, \nStrengths: Student mentoring: many, many: MS program, have hired many past students as clinical adjunct faculty and faculty into the role, 12. \nWeaknesses: \nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale: Definitely bring in for on campus interviews. I spoke with her for over an hour and had a wonderful conversation. \n1.\tShe has extensive experience with ABSN students both in the classroom and in the clinical site.\n2.\tVery strong clinical background\n3.\tHas taught online\n4.\tIncredible enthusiasm and creativity and a clear passion for teaching\n5.\tVery flexible and open to teaching whatever is needed\n6.\tAlso expressed desire in learning  to chair capstones\n7.\tVery interested in advancing her pedagogical scholarship\n8.\tValues and respects students\n9.\tAn excellent fit with the DUSON culture. \nStart date to clarify: She wanted to verify that if offered a position, the start date would be fall 2014.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1318","CandID":"531","CommenterInitials":"PT","DateOfComment":"2014-05-01T00:00:00","Comment":"CONFIDENTIAL\nFaculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :         Carolyn Robinson        \t\t\t Position: ABSN Program Director  \n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)\nMany publications, some funding.

Current position is an excellent match. \n\nLong term goal: Combine her strengths of administrative leadership skills and love of pre-licensure students.

(If they are currently in a position)\nCurrent position was “made for me”. She knew she wanted to move back to the Triangle and emailed Janice Humphries to see if there would be any open positions, prior to the position being posted.

The current position provides an opportunity to excel and use her leadership skills and love of ABSN students.\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  The position is tailor made and Duke has a fantastic reputation. She would like to collaborate with faculty both across DUSON and the campus.\n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths? \n1. “Bring people together to produce results. Listen, to both sides. Fair, open minded, and make a decision. Don’t dwell on decisions. Clear on expectations for faculty members. While we are concerned with student outcomes, it requires using individual faculty for their strengths, empowers faculty. If they enjoy what they are doing we will have the best student results”. \n2. “Important to have a healthy academic work environment” As a leader she believes in role modeling a healthy, positive environment. She is a TEAM person. Others say I am “wise and intelligent”. Proactive vs. reactive. \n3. Extrovert – Enjoys meeting people and going out to represent the school in public, being the voice of the school, program. \n\n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\n\nThings have changed across the years in academia. “It is always a challenge to deal with a dozen issues at one time, however, this is the new reality. The challenge is to successfully, thoroughly, and effectively manage these dozen or more issues”.\n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nThousands and thousands of nursing students who I have taught and role-modeled (including doing patient care, research, translational research) who are now providing great patient care and higher achieving higher degrees. \n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? Community, occupational and environmental health\na.\tClass size: up to 128\nb.\tClinical groups: up to 10\nc.\tOnline: yes, most classes hybrid\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy – “I will do the best I can to make teaching fun and engaging as possible. Make the student responsible for their participation.”\n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nEnvironmental, occupational health and agricultural health. Open to working with others on other topics. “I would want to assess what the needs are in the region to guide research in this  direction to meet the needs of the population in NC”.

She can supervise community and public health students. She is not a NP.\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nWhy the recent changes in employment and how long were you a Dean?\nThe Dean opportunity (n=800 students) fell into her lap and she feels she made a big contribution. She felt she was very successful in the role and really enjoyed the opportunity. Her original path was as a researcher, however she transitioned from a research career to administration with this opportunity and really loved it. She was in the Dean role for 2 years when the School opened a 2nd campus much closer to her home; she was commuting 2 hours a day (one way) while Dean. She volunteered to step down and help get the new programs up at the new campus. In this role, Director of Knoxville Region for Nursing Programs, she was able to help get these programs started (further description below). She was in this role for 4 years [Directing MS (FNP, Nurse Educator, Administrator), RN to BSN (6 campuses). There was then turmoil at the University and the President was given a no confidence vote and forced to resign, no confidence vote. During this time Carolyn felt an ethical dilemma. She then took her current position in Knoxville with the understanding it would be for one year. She knew her husband would be retiring in a year and she would want to move back to NC. The Dean at this school understood and asked her to take her current position and help mentor some of the more junior faculty. In the past year she has focused on teaching a lot of pre-licensure students and really loved it. While she has taught them in the past, it had been awhile and she felt re-energized with this experience. She has previously taught RN-BSN for 7 years, also taught PhD and MSN students. She really enjoys teaching students with a previous degree, and nursing, was a GEL MS. \n\nAdditional Questions for ABSN Program Director Candidates:\n1.\tWhat administrative experiences do you have running a program in a school of nursing or other department? \nA.\tDean: 2 years (800 students)\nb.\tDirector of Knoxville Region for Nursing Programs: 4 years\nc.\tSpecific skills and accomplishments\ni.\tCurriculum development and revision \nii.\tStrategic planning and Policy development at school and University level\niii.\tFaculty recruitment, interviewing, hiring\niv.\tLed accreditation process for SACS, and CCNE and approvals from BON for new programs.

In RN to BSN and MSN programs, majority of students were from rural Apalacia. \n\n\n2.\tWhat experience do you have with designing curricula in a school of nursing or other department? Tons, see above. \n\n\n3.\tWhat would be your philosophy as director of an ABSN program? \nA.\t“Offer and provide students with a consistent evidence-based curriculum and provide clinical experiences that will prepare them to practice in the changing health care system”. \nB.\t“Because these students have a previous degree, acknowledge their previous experience and respect them for background and diverse experiences. Use that background and incorporate it so students learn from me and other professors.”\n\n\n\n\n4.\tWhat has been your commitment to diversity and inclusion?\nFor past 7 years, has taught at schools that have the majority of students from Apalacia. Majority of BSN completion students are African Americans from rural communities and told they must complete a BSN within 5 years.

Long-term goal was to develop skills in all aspects of being a full-time faculty (but said she wasn’t exactly sure what all was entailed with being a full-time faculty member). She also wants to pursue certification as a CNE.\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nMost of her time at DUSON has been as a Project Coordinator, transitioned to clinical faculty as funding ended and also worked as a teaching assistant. Has worked as a TA in Adult Health and Leadership courses with DUSON faculty. Also has online experience. She wants to stay in the area and continue to teach.\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nShe has been co-teaching in DUSON AH class, has been at Duke and is interested in staying here.\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nTeaching in other courses outside of her pediatric experience has been helpful , and has taught her that peds content is applicable across the lifespan, that there are many overlaps. She thought it was an easy transition from peds to AH. Feels she is flexible, and has a diverse clinical background. She feels she receives feedback well as a CI. Feels she is a lifelong learner with DNP.\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nLimited experience with item-writing, but has graded papers with rubrics. She took a class this past spring with an expert in item-writing. Developing her comfort level with classroom teaching of new content, but says she has been told this can take 3-4 times of teaching the same content to achieve.\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nGraduating last May with her DNP.  Her capstone project was published in April 2014. She has been re-elected to the Neonatal Nursing Association, and she is proud of the ABSN students set to graduate this weekend. She has been with them since they started and proud of their achievements.\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?  **Struggled to actually answer this question, and after several minutes of talking, asked me what the question was again.\nA.\tClass size\nb.\tClinical groups\nc.\tOnline\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy\n\nShe is interested in the literature related to bridging classroom and clinical content. Content across class/ clinical/ lab needs to be better organized and not so challenging. Classroom faculty often not in clinical to share information. Was an online student, but prefers classroom sessions, and not just lecture. Wants to help students apply class content in clinical.\n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans? (**framed as scholarship with clinical track position)\nShe has published her capstone project on congenital heart disease screening. Has ideas for publishing other manuscripts from that data. She is also interested in nurse incivility both in clinical settings and academia, faculty and students.\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nPublished in april 2014.\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\n\nShe has not practiced clinically in many years. Keeps up to date on neonatal nursing and leadership.\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:  She seems like a very nice person, but had difficulty answering the question asked at times, but kept talking. Then she would ask me to clarify. I could not tell if this was because she was nervous or not. At the end of my questions for her,  I asked her if she had any other questions for the search committee and she did not have any, but rather launched into a 5 minute elaboration on her service work highlights.

I am, however, inclined to not proceed with further recruitment.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1335","CandID":"536","CommenterInitials":"BC","DateOfComment":"2014-05-19T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :        Kennedy Onari\t\t\t Position:  AH/ Foundations\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)\n\nNo research funding; just completed PhD in 2013.

Have had great opportunities with local D.C. Clinic and Children’s National Hospital, not Georgetown’s hospital.\nInterested in community linkages—sees more potential in Durham\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nTeaching----both at the academic setting as well as a CNS---seeing how students learn at not only in the clinical context, but at the foundational level in the academic setting.  Making sure students don’t focus on the task and really focus on the concepts\nWorked as a psych nurse and critical care, ED, transport (peds and adult)---lots of variation in what I’ve done clinically and that has been very helpful.  \nHad great mentoring relationship with a lot of students---what likes most about her position as instructor.\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nWork oriented;  tendency to work very hard and many hours; hard to “turn things off”\nSome areas haven’t done a lot of teaching---done lots of clinical setting, leadership, simulation and lab, general skills, but other areas that she hasn’t taught---e.g., public health, home health\nPublications-working on her first post-phd publications;  so focused on teaching, so haven’t published.

The citation is unclear and incomplete. \n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship: Her “Creative Works” are very clinically focused and an excellent match for the AGNP focus (physical assessment, ECG’s, etc)\n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs: Dr. Kellerman taught in a Community College from 1986-1996. In 1994, she began her own CEU company, “Educational Enterprises Inc.). She has a wealth of teaching experience in national and international forums with a strength in the delivery of continuing education. Her formal teaching in formal schools of nursing is somewhat outdated. She does use a variety of methods to deliver education including online and in person.\n\n4.\tMentorship experience congruent with position’s needs – Not addressed in the CV.\n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice\nCertified as adult and gero NP –FAANP. Has maintained a clinical practice as a NP. This is a strength. \n\n6.\tService to the profession: none listed on CV\n\n7.\tJob stability – Has owned own company since 1994, but always held a variety of other positions\n\n8.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON – Teaching physical assessment, pharm, perhaps patho. \n\n9.\tIf this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked:\n\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  Yes to phone screen. I think it is important to clarify how much she wants to formally teach in the program, and how much she wants to develop CE through DUSON. \n1.\tYou state in your letter you wish to explore the opportunity to offer CE’s through DUSON, per conversations with Dean Gilliss and Dr. Zycowicz. Please discuss what you envision this would look like, and how it would affect your business.\n2.\tThe position is in the MS track teaching NP’s. Your last formal position with a SON was in 1996. How would you envision this full time position affecting your business?\n3.\tDUSON requires both scholarship and service. Can you discuss how you believe you have contributed to these areas thus far in your career? What are you goals for continued development in these areas?","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1348","CandID":"540","CommenterInitials":"PT","DateOfComment":"2014-06-29T00:00:00","Comment":"Faculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :         Maria Orsini        \t\t\t Position: Psych NP  \n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate for career stage (summarize).

(If they are currently in a position)\nLeft last position and have been in academia previously and enjoyed it. Would like to stay in academia; enjoyed teaching  and the administrative role.\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nDukes reputation; high quality; international reputation. Duke and this area; lost her husband and would like to be here in this area where her support systems are.\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nLeadership since 1987 and proven herself as a visionary leader. Excellent mentor,  team player.  Likes to get others perspective whether faculty or students. Strategically someone who collaborates well but also works well independently. Very organized.\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nHigh expectations for herself and works to try not to impose those on others.\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nBeing recognized as FAAN. Makes her feel she has done some good things related to nursing in her career and her peers recognized her for those.\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion? Leadership, administration, financial management research and EBP. Teaching NP courses and CNL courses. Developed CNL in Queens.

Has taught up to 68\nb.\tClinical groups: 8-12\nc.\tOnline: Up to 50 but this is not ideal for discussions or interactive things you can accomplish\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy\nStudent centered; make the courses what the students need and in the format they need. Knowing these things change over time; understanding the need to be adaptable to those needs. Knowledge, critical thinking (applying knowledge) and curiosity (cyclical). Create a safe environment for student learning; using adult learning styles. Student centered; allowing them to have a voice. Key goals as an educator: foster critical thinking, facilitate life-long learning; help students EB clinical thinking.\n8.\tWhat are your research interests?

Would like to look at QOL in other chronic conditions.\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nN/A\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\nCertified prior to 2005 so was grandfathered into not requiring certification. Currently does not actively practice.\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nVarious short term positions:\nAsked to do things that were not her strengths. Husband became ill at one point and died; administration had changed significantly and the new dean was not as supportive. Moved to Maine with specific goals in mind and the goals identified between her and the dean were very specific. That Dean was let go and the program changed and everything that she came for had changed and they let her resign to allow for someone to apply that was in line with the model.\nFocus of administrative talents: Most are transferrable although some are unique to academia. Team oriented; likes to work with groups and teams; discuss things with faculty and get different perspectives. Understands there are times that as a leader you have to make independent decisions and she is comfortable doing that but likes to be collaborative. Regular meetings with faculty allowing them to make the agenda so the most important thing to that faculty member is addressed and then additional items she would like to add can be done so afterwards. Team meetings with agendas put together from all team members to promote collaborative environment.\n\nAdditional Questions for ABSN Program Director Candidates:\n1.\tWhat administrative experiences do you have running a program in a school of nursing or other department?\n\nExtensive since 1987; multiple settings including hospital, pharmaceutical settings, running her own consultation business and schools of nursing.\n9 online nursing programs (1500 students, 50-60 faculty and 8-10 staff). Editor for international journal \n\n2.\tWhat experience do you have with designing curricula in a school of nursing or other department?\n\nInvolved in designing new curricula and programs UNC Charlotte (CNL curricula and sat on program for ABSN program) and Queens and ST Josephs\n\n3.\tWhat would be your philosophy as director of an ABSN program? \n\nABSN programs are good opportunity or method to bring new into nursing. Students tend to have higher expectations for themselves and faculty may not have these same expectations. The focus often times on GPA and due to their maturity the students, faculty tend to respect diverse backgrounds in different ways and should try to bring those backgrounds into ways of knowing and relate those to nursing. Promote comfort in sharing previous experiences with others.\n(Focused here on what type of students we have and why they are in the ABSN program. Could not get her out of this direction despite prodding).\n\n\n4.\tWhat has been your commitment to diversity and inclusion?\nBoth in clinical, education and administration. Very attentive to various types of individuals including ESL, ethnicity, ages, religion. Ensures to help those in terms of their learning to find resources needed.\nRecent at St. Joseph: Created a relationship with the Philippines to have Filipino students complete the NP program; site visits overseen by their faculty.\n5.\t How might your previous diversity and inclusion efforts (and philosophy) enhance the ABSN program?\nWould work to enhance diversity by reaching out and networking with different groups and areas (i.e. churches and community centers). Recruit more individuals from rural areas. Part of the director’s job to network with businesses that may support their employees in taking 16 months off to complete the ABSN program to return and benefit their business.\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nI would recommend a campus visit based on our discussion. There were some weak areas in terms of philosophy for the ABSN program director position and also in diversity. She also is only interested in 12 month appointment which is worrisome with her history of various short term positions. \nWhat I feel she does bring is an extensive history in administrative roles in academia and other business areas. She has experience in mentorship of students and faculty, a great history of working with students and faculty on research projects and publications. She was very personable over the phone and was interested in our needs.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1350","CandID":"544","CommenterInitials":"KW","DateOfComment":"2014-06-30T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :    Wanda Hilliard, MBA, MSN, APRN, PMHNP-BC        Position:  Psych NP\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)\nCurrently DNP student at UAB with expected graduation of May 2015.

Leadership award -$1000, local STT Chapter award-$1000, Janssen Pharmaceuticals--$1000, others ranging from $300 to $3000.\n\n•\tApplicant mentions a preference for an online position; does that mean she is not willing to relocate to NC?\nWhen I asked applicant to clarify her request for an online position (from cover letter),  she explained that because her husband is Masters of Divinity student at SMU in Dallas, and she has just opened the first of 4 acute psych clinics in Houston (\"my passion\"), she would prefer to stay in Houston.  She did say she would be happy to come to DUSON “when necessary”.   However, when I told her that this position would require the faculty member to be physically present on campus & live in the area, she said that they would be happy to do that as well.  I reinforced that at the end of the call as well as at the beginning.\n\nOther questions to me from applicant:\n•\tShe asked about whether her teaching assignment would be a psych course in the Family NP program or several courses in a Psych NP program.  She also asked to hear more details about the VA & DUSON collaborative project mentioned in job description.  \nI told her she would have to ask Dr. Merwin about her specific course assignments if she was invited for an on-campus visit.  But that as I understood it, she would teach a psych course in the MSN Adult Health/Family NP program because we did not have a Psych NP program at this time.  She asked about the course title & I looked on the sample MAT plans for Adult/Gero & Family & did not find any psych courses.  So told her I’d have to get back to her about that.  I also told her that I did not have the specific information about the VA position at this time, but would get back to her next week.\n\n•\tShe asked about the opportunity to teach a leadership or a genetics course in the MSN or DNP program since she has MBA & also her Capstone is focused on genetics.\nI told her I did not know that information but that she could talk to the Executive Vice Dean about that if she was invited for an on-campus visit. \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nI feel that there are several options for this applicant depending on Administration’s plans for curriculum changes or development of new programs:\n•\tWe should stop recruitment for this applicant because she is 9 mths away from completing her DNP.  She is certainly welcome to reapply once she has finished her DNP.  We do not currently have a psych course that she could teach in the MSN program, so not clear on what the need for a psych NP is currently with our MSN curriculum.  Although she said that she was willing to relocate, she is very involved with development of the acute psych clinics in Houston and her husband is in graduate school at SMU.  \n•\tIf there is a new program being developed with the VA-DUSON, we need more information about that program before we continue recruitment with this applicant for that program.  Or maybe that program will be developed & started by the time this applicant finishes her DNP?  In that case, maybe we should continue recruitment of this candidate who has 5 years of psych clinical practice in a variety of settings.\n•\tIf Administration is developing a new Psych NP clinical program, then perhaps this applicant should be invited for an on-campus visit to pursue a faculty position in that program?  Perhaps that will be timed to coincide with the date that this applicant is graduating with her DNP?\n•\tTo be discussed at our meeting Monday, August 4th.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1357","CandID":"544","CommenterInitials":"KW","DateOfComment":"2014-08-07T00:00:00","Comment":"Phone Screen #2:\nApplicant:     Wanda Hilliard, MBA, MSN,  APRN, PMHNP-BC        Position:  Psych NP\n\n\n1.\tExplained to applicant that our policy is to hire faculty with completed doctoratal degrees.  But when the applicant is currently in doctoral program & close to finishing, we feel more comfortable if we have a specific date for your final defense.  Do you think you will truly finish in May 2015?  If so, what is the date for your final defense?\n\nApplicant feels that even though she is yet to submit to the IRB, she will really finish in May.  She has done her proposal defense, has the IRB proposal ready to submit (meeting with her Chair next week at UAB), and is collecting data retrospectively from charts—so data collection will be fairly fast.  She said that her final defense is tentatively planned for mid-March 2015, although she seemed a bit confused about what her project data collection and analysis will entail.  \n\n2.  \tOur Search committee was curious why you wanted to relocate to Duke when you are so obviously invested in the free mental health clinics in Houston?  \n\nAlthough she enjoys her clinical work in Houston & is proud of what she has accomplished, she wants to take an academic position (now that she will have a doctorate) to grow in her career.  She is frustrated by the lack of options for academic positions in Houston related to a Psych MSN program where she could teach.  There are no Psych MSN programs in Houston, closest ones are in San Antonio (2 ½ hrs away) or Dallas (4 ½ hrs away) or Austin (3 hrs away) and all require face to face attendance or physical presence very often on campus.  She feels that they will have to move anyway (see comments about TX options for her to teach in Psych NP program), and wanted to relocate to a place where they can both work on their careers.  Her husband is finishing his Masters in Divinity in March & would love to pursue his PhD in Divinity at Duke.  So this would be a great place.  Husband is “totally supportive” to move if she is offered this position. \n\nShe talked at length about why there are less Psych providers than needed.  (1) fewer MDs are going into Psych as a specialty b/c of the low reimbursement/payment options. (2)  No PA programs include Psych as speciality;  (3) very few schools of Nursing have Psych NP programs anymore, so the demand is much higher than supply; (4) because of the dearth of Psychiatrists, which are necessary to partner with for NP practice, fewer NPs can practice in Psych area.    Huge demand for MSN Psych NP programs online so people can live where they practice & still get NP degree.\n\n3.\tI asked for more details of the $20,000 grant proposal she is working on to fund her Capstone project.  Who is the funding agency she is approaching?\nShe said her Chair suggested she approach the APNA (American Psych Nurses Association) for funds or the International Society of Psych RNs.  She has written the proposal & is meeting with her Chair next week to discuss further.  The money will be for genetic testing, but wasn’t sure what she would do if it was not funded.  \n\n4.  \tI explained the details of the VA-DUSON collaborative practice and our HRSA funding for planned Psych MSN-NP program.  She was very enthusiastic about both opportunities and again reiterated how important the Psych MSN-NP program would be if it was online.  She knows many nurses who would love to study for that degree if they did not have to move.\n\n5.  She expressed appreciation of the follow up phone call and stated that she appreciated our careful review whether or not she was asked to come to campus for continued recruitment.  \n\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nAgain, I am torn about this applicant.  Potentially she could be a huge asset with her strong clinical background and enthusiasm about both the VA-DUSON program and the planned DUSON Psych-NP program.  But neither one of those programs are up and running at this time.  And she is still a DNP student hoping to finish in May.  We have a date for the applicant’s final DNP Capstone defense of mid-March, but that seems very fast for a project involving genetic testing.  And that date is from the student’s perspective and not her Chair’s perspective.  Additionally, her project seems a bit confusing as to whether she is doing only a retrospective chart review with some genetic testing later on or then a followup, or the chart review only.  At this point I would say continue recruitment, but is probably worth another call to applicant later in Fall or early Spring to ask about her progress.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1358","CandID":"552","CommenterInitials":"BC","DateOfComment":"2014-08-18T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :   Stephanie Terry               \t\t\t Position:  Sr. Nurse Reseacher\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity.\nNo research funding or publications.\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship\nNo program of research.\n3.\tTeaching experience \nHas teaching experience but did not specify in what areas.

Wanted to get her DNP so that she could pursue teaching. Currently teaching leadership to on-campus cohort of CRNA DNP students.\n\nLong term goal is to teach and help prepare future generation of CRNA; become a liaison between the students and the clinical setting and act as a mentor and facilitator for students who are completing their capstone projects in anesthesia.\n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? N/A\n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nLong term Duke fan. Loved going to school at Duke to get DNP. She was very impressed by the quality of her DNP education at Duke, particularly the advice and encouragement of Mary Champagne and Barbara Turner. Emphasized that her Duke education far exceeded her undergraduate and master’s educational preparation.\n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nGood track record in leadership role at Duke for past 8 years. Describes herself as resilient, able to work through tough issues and bounce back stronger (emphasized that CRNAs are a tough group to work with). Another strength is ability to multitask and fill multiple roles. Good speaker – enjoys speaking nationally about CRNA change management. Leads by example – 7 CRNAs at Duke have returned to get DNP since she finished her DNP. Deals with conflict well. “And I’m a great CRNA!”\n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nTendency to think big, with the 50,000 ft view, which sometimes leads to missing details; as a result has learned to start small. Sometimes struggles with big decisions and second-guesses herself. \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nHer current role as chief CRNA at Duke. Started with a small “broken” program, grew from 40-150 CRNAs, built a stronger team. Created a 1-year orientation process w/stipend for Duke CRNAs – unique and only one in US.\n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\nVery much enjoys teaching in the classroom with small groups rather than online (has done both with leadership courses in DNP program). Also enjoys clinical teaching; loves taking CRNA students into OR for the first time, and then witnessing their development over time. Believes most effective teachers are those who are calm and encouraging and remain “human”; appreciates a relaxed style of teaching and feels open to criticism and suggestions for improvement.\n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nShe does not have an interest in research and does not plan to pursue a research agenda. She does however enjoy the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based practice changes (DNP role). Currently has seven quality improvements initiatives in progress – this is a direct result of her DNP education. \n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nShe has submitted her capstone manuscript to three journals that have turned it down. She has submitted it most recently to the Journal of Perioperative Nursing, decision pending. She describes herself as someone who has “become a champion at attempting to publish!”\n\n10.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\nHolds certification as a CRNA – must take on 25 anesthesia cases per year to maintain credentialing at Duke. Currently devotes 5% of her time to clinical practice. She would be open to continuing her practice, or not, depending on the needs of the CRNA program faculty.\n\n11.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nAsked about participation in grant writing:  She has participated in grant applications for her department, but not as a lead writer. Example was helping to complete application to obtain funding for CRNAs to have research support at Duke (time to work on research projects).\nAsked about her commitment to diversity and inclusion:  Diversity and inclusion have been on her “score card” for yearly performance evaluations since she began her role as chief CRNA 8 years ago. She describes attending CRNA conferences as a “sea of white people” which led her to visit 8 different HBCUs to talk to the BSN students about the CRNA role; she offered to facilitate shadowing experiences and gave recommendations to the students on how to prepare for a strong application to CRNA programs. For the past seven years she has met her annual goal of increasing the diversity of her team by 5% each year. \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\n\tDr. Gilman Mays was very confident and enthusiastic in her phone interview. She clearly has a very strong desire to make teaching the next step in her career, and she pursued the DNP degree for that reason. She has a very strong track record as an administrator and leader at Duke, with a proven commitment to diversity and inclusion. She realizes that her lack of scholarly writing makes her a less competitive candidate, and she understands that as a faculty member she would be expected to engage in scholarly practice and writing. She identified the 7 current QI projects that she initiated after finishing her DNP program as potential areas for dissemination. She has a working knowledge of the Duke CRNA program and what is expected of faculty and students, so she would be able to step into the role and hit the ground running. Potential negatives include the fact that three of our CRNA faculty members are Duke DNP graduates, and there may be a need to bring in someone from outside Duke for a fresh perspective, and although clearly passionate about preparing the next generation of CRNAs, she does not have a strong track record of teaching and has not held a faculty position before. However, given the job description below, I feel that she is highly qualified for the particular role, and I would add her to the pool of candidates to invite for a campus visit. Her stated long-term goal of becoming a liaison between the students and the clinical setting and acting as a mentor and facilitator for students who are completing their capstone projects is also aligned with the job description.\n\tFrom the posted job description: “The faculty member is responsible for participating in a dynamic faculty role that includes supporting didactic instruction in on-campus and online environments, assisting in the management of clinical sites, and engaging clinical partners in the development of DNP capstone project partnerships. The faculty member will also serve as a DNP capstone chair and/or committee member, participate in the student admissions process, and be responsible for supporting the evaluation of students in simulated clinical experiences.”","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1379","CandID":"554","CommenterInitials":"WTB","DateOfComment":"2014-10-16T00:00:00","Comment":"Faculty Search Committee             Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant:      KERASIOTIS, Dina                 \t\t\t Position:   ABSN Psych\n\n1.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\nShort: did not get certified initially b/c not required; has just completed review course and is in process of submitting documents to take certification exam.

Her dissertation focused on PTSD symptoms in nurses and found a high level of anxiety.  She would like to look further for ways to prevent/alleviate burnout in nurses.  The second area of interest is to help students match their personality with the type of clinical setting best suited for them when entering the healthcare market.\n\n9.\tWhat are your practice interests?\nCurrent clinical practice involves both a day hospital and inpatient psych settings.\n\n10.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\nReviewer comment: “I do not see where she has developed teaching skills necessary for clinical track ABSN faculty”: candidate relayed she taught full courses in physical, social, and developmental psychology as adjunct at Hofstra.

On campus is her favorite.  She likes to “collaborate in the classroom”, “ask questions”, “use storytelling”, “I ask them to share”, says she is not authoritative (in style). \nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy: ” individuals who are unique and with a variety of needs” (should) be given “opportunity for active learning”, they “require a variety of resources “ (for success). Feedback and the environment are  important (such as lighting, comfortable seats, the temperature).  \n8.\tWhat are your research interests?

Thinks post war veteran nursing students are interesting. \n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? n/a\n\n10.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  .  I grew up in NC and my grandfather exposed me to multicultural music. She  implied this prepares her for multi cultural sensitivity.  States she has worked with diverse students, both racially and socioeconomically (esp at Walden).Had a positive response about a student with a visual handicap “we don’t know if they will succeed, so we just have to support them”. She was not specific about how to do that. \n\n11.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)? “technology” \n\n12.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it? Yes, plan to continue “my small practice”. As CNS, she work at nursing homes, visits her clients.

Not much vision, lots of ‘uhs’ . I found myself working hard to draw out information, her strengths, a vision. She likes to tell stories, drops a pedagogical term here and there, but I heard no real vision.  She did not know much about our program.  Her current position is within a set of six faculty, and they were just accredited.  She has not presented at conferences, or implemented any practice innovation or guidelines.  She speaks to church groups.  I did not get the impression she has significant potential for scholarly practice. \nI am also worried the ABSN students will pose questions she cannot answer in an academic way. However, there can be teaching done in storytelling fashion, esp. if it is structured and purposefully builds information and concepts that will assist the student.  I do not feel she is that structured.\nMy opinion leans towards no further pursuit of this candidate. But, I realize this is an important decision, and would prefer I not be the only word on this for two reasons: I am new at the job on this committee, and it is someone’s career we are impacting.

Ms. Liu has 5 publications, including one in press, in what she calls “English” journals and 9 publications in Chinese journals. She has several in review and in preparation.  In addition, she has several poster/oral presentations with one invited presentation.  She has not received external grant funding as PI. In addition, as she states, she has served or is serving as a reviewer for 7 journals in nursing and medicine (e.g., Nursing Research, Geriatric nursing). She also participants as a member of various organizations (e.g., The Gerontological Society of America, The American Geriatrics Society).\n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship. Her research focuses on gerontology, cognitive decline, issues pertaining to long-term care and measurement and statistics. For example, her dissertation work is focused on “optimizing eating performance among long-term care residents with cognitive impairment.  Overall, she has been in the role as a research assistant with numerous faculty. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience. Most of her experience has been as a guest lecturer to both undergraduate and graduate students (Masters and Ph.D.).  The areas covered included statistical analyses of quantitative data, measurement and its reliability and validity, as well as the conduct of systematic reviews. She has been involved in what appears to be teaching in training programs, covering such areas as palliative care and dementia care.  As stated in one of her cover letters, she would like to teach research design, basic and advanced statistics, measurement, and the use of various software programs – about which was not stated. No teaching evaluations were provided.\n\n4.\tMentorship experience.  No (research) mentoring experience is mentioned. In service rolls, she has played a role in connecting students with curricula, campus life, and campus resources.  \n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice.

She is a member of six professional organizations and is serving or has served as a reviewer to 7 journals. There is no evidence that she has served as a grant reviewer.  She is serving as a representative to the Graduate Student Association for the DSO Executive Committee Board and has served as a Curriculum Committee Representative for the DSO Executive Committee Board. \n\n7.\tJob stability. No data were presented as to her various jobs and tenure within each job. It appears that from 2008 until now she has been getting educational degrees.

The candidate has 2 publications and 4 papers in preparation. In addition, she has 3 published abstracts and 14 unpublished presentations – one presentation is in a “other” category which I did not know how to categorize.  She received funding from three external organizations (range $1,000 to $2000) to support what appears to be her dissertation. Among these three, she had to return one source of funding due to changes in dissertation study. She received four honors. \n \n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship. Her research focus is on “technology assisted health self-management and decision making in patients with chronic disorders and their families.” For example, her dissertation work is focused on “factors associated with acceptance and use of mobile technology for health self-monitoring and decision support in lung transplant recipients.” Overall, she has worked as a research assistant in three R01 level projects and one R21 level project. In addition, in terms of educational scholarship, she has developed a 7-module online course in nursing informatics.  The candidate did not discuss her vision to obtain external funding. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience.  Listed in her CV are various didactic courses she has participated in as a teaching fellow from 2009 to 2015 with student composition ranging from 10 to 80+. Most of the courses involved nursing informatics, with other areas covered including: foundations of nursing practice, introduction to basic statistics, methods in technology evaluation and usability, and nutrition for clinical practice.  She lists designing and developing the “methods in technology evaluation and usability” course only. She has  served as a guest lecturer covering such topics as nursing informatics, health promotion and disease prevention. No student evaluations were presented. \n\n4.\tMentorship experience.  She assisted one BSN study, who was part of the Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program, during the Fall and Spring of 2012. Guidance was provided in the conduct of literature reviews, data entry and analyses, and helping to create a poster. No other mentorship activities were mentioned.   \n\n5.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice. As stated in her cover letter, her post-baccalaureate work experience has been as a “medical information specialist and a project manager in the department of new drug research and development in a Chinese pharmaceutical company.”  She lists having a nursing license through 2016 (Pennsylvania RN) – among four one of which was as a registered pharmacist in China (inactive).

She lists being a member of 8 professional organizations of which she is a current member in four (e.g., American Medical Informatics Association, Society of Behavioral Medicine). \n\n7.\tJob stability. For 2009 until 2014 she has served as a teaching fellow at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Nursing.

Her number of publications is limited as well as her history of getting funding. Her main area of research, informatics, could be very valuable to DUSON. Unfortunately, she did not embellish on her plans for research and thoughts about obtaining research funding. While I am not highly enthusiastic about the candidate, I think getting greater clarity about her research endeavors would be helpful.

First passion in your topic of research in order to continue with it. Being able to collaborate with several people (e.g., engineers, clinicians in oncology) and work together as team. Writing is important – because English is her second language, she needs and desires to do more writing.  She also believes in having a long term goal and then try to achieve it step-by-step.  She will need organization support (e.g., from the grants office, small funding, have people to review grants before submission, editorial service). \n\n12.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?

As she approaches graduation, she will apply for OPT (optional practice training) to continue working.  When she gets a faculty positions, she will apply for H-1B upon job offer and a green card if the organization supports her.  \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:  Yun was pleasant on the phone, and she does have a relatively deep accent. It is clear she is very motivated to pursue research at the intersection of nursing and informatics using technologies to improve health/disease self-management. These interests, combined with her focus on cancer populations can benefit DUSON’s interest sin oncology and informatics. At the moment, she does have some short-term plans about what to do to support her research. She does seem to have some teaching experience and can probably teach a variety of courses (see above). May have some concerns about being able to obtain external federal funding. She will also need some assistance with writing, given that English is her second language. Would consider her to be  a viable candidate for campus visit.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1424","CandID":"566","CommenterInitials":"RR/BC","DateOfComment":"2014-12-12T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant Telephone Screening Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant:     Hudson Santos                                         \t\t\t Position:  Assist Professor\n\n1.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\nShort term goals –strengthen current collaboration with current (DUSON) mentors; resubmit or submit K award and seek additional funding; expand teaching.\nLong-term goals – to become an independent (decrease reliance on mentors and take the lead more in research) tenured track researcher.

He has some teaching experience and a number of publications and conference papers (most outside of U.S.)\nHe could fit well within DUSON but might not be the strongest candidate or match on research interests beyond his mentors here.  Would wait to invite for campus visit until we see if other applicants are stronger. \nBrigit:\nWhile he does require some mentoring, he has a strong base support here and strong collaborative inter-disciplinary teams which he has created. This is a tremendous strength. He has a focused area of research and already understands areas in which he would like to expand and has taken some steps to move in those directions. He is not currently funded but has a K award under review.

I think she will be able to contribute to DUSON and nursing profession through her research, and can get a quick start since she has been at DUKE SOM.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1426","CandID":"576","CommenterInitials":"RR","DateOfComment":"2014-12-12T00:00:00","Comment":"Complete text from interview worksheet (posted in candidate folder):\n\ninterviewed 12/11/2014 (RR) \n\n1.\tWhat are your short and long term goals for a faculty position?\n\nShort term goal-\nSeveral grant aims to get out the door. 4 grants currently in review that she wants to see outcome on, and then begin, or make plans for resubmission or new funding source and application. \n\nWas accepted for the Duke SOM LEADER training.  (Rachel note: this is a good training dealing with leadership, personal inventory/external assessments, and skill building targeted to SOM and SON research faculty.)  Wants to complete LEADER  training.   Is doing it now. This will help her in her transition to independent researcher.\n\nReally is  interested in Health Care work force.  NIOSH is good.  She has 2 pieces in progress that are related to NINR.  Very specific ideas for new grants include:  \n 1.) Process of constant observation (patient attendants/sitters through her violence project but could not find ant literature on costs and risks for them.  The NINR community based research grant is of interest to her and she is starting to write this. Ultimately wants training for this group and how they can \n2.) Set up a cohort of nursing students and follow them after school and a few years after. Wants to look at why they stayed in the field.  Is some work in Swede n to model. Manny Beringie (Duke Occupational Med) is a potential colleague here at Duke. \n\n\n\nLong term goal –\nAshley has clearly identified and articulated a number of broad issues that she would like to explore: \n\n•\tWorkplace / workforce Issues with patient outcomes – want to understand more patient populations nurses care for and how nursing workplace safety and violence prevention impacts them.\n•\tWorkforce, particularly the aging nursing workforce population.\n•\tWants do to more qualitative research or work with DUSON investigators that do ; she is trained in quantitative epidemiology but everything she does is really mixed methods. So she has some exposure and great appreciation for this.  \n•\tWants to explore and promote the strength of observational methods, which are gaining new importance and appreciation with so many EHRs and high cost of prospective research. Because of her training in Epidemiology, she can bring public health perspective to DUSON projects. \n•\tRetention  of nurses and impact on patient outcomes and the workforce capacity\n\nDoes not want publicity but wants to be known for impact. She wants to make a difference. Wants to be known for making an impact on the nursing workforce and on patients. Most of her research is targeted to and funded by NIOHS, but NIOHS does not fund research on patient outcomes.  She would like to take her ideas and explore other funding sources that would allow her to really look at the impact of different workplace and workforce issues on nurses and patients.\n\n \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position) – N/A\n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \n\nShe is currently Asst Prof in Duke School of Medicine (Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Community and Family Medicine). \n\nWants to get teaching exposure.  Wants to work in an environment with lots of researchers and commitment to build a work force. Looking for a supportive and stable environment.  Wants a permanent faculty position in a setting that will support her goals for long term research career and to get independent funding.  Wants to remain at Duke but appears to be looking for more stability. \n\nShe has so many community ties here at Duke and UNC that she could transition to Duke seamlessly. \n\n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\n\nEnjoys writing.  Can write to the reader of the grant.  Another strength is that she is good at seeing the big picture.  E.g., has put in grants that have not been funded and has noticed on reviewer feedback that they do not always see the big picture but focus on a minor detail. \n\nAlso, she is not afraid to say no to projects that are not exactly in her program of research or interest area.  She has been invited to join many grants but she will not do things that do not “fit” her.  \n\nAsks us PLEASE to check her references. They have been great mentors and she has learned so much from them; due to their influence and support she wants to be a good leaders and mentor in the future as well. \n \n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\n\n “opportunities for  improvement”  (lol) \nDoes not have a nursing degree.  Though she knows about nursing workforce and context of care and caring.  She realizes that she is “a block away but sometimes a world away” from clinical care settings. She recognizes this and will work to get a better sense of daily nursing practice and issues.\n\nDoes not have a teaching component to her job now but she would enjoy expanding her skill set and teach more. Has had luxury to been able to pick students to work with (on guided research projects). She will need mentoring and support from DUSON to be able to work with a broad range of students and manage a full class.  \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\n\n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\n\nAdmittedly she has very little teaching experience (only lectures, and some train-the-trainer training) but she wants to gain that experience here at DUSON. She has taught classes as needed.  Enjoys it a lot.  Enoys boiling down hard concepts into smaller chuncks.  And dynamic.\n\nAreas to teach – particularly can do Epidemiology; Special topics in occ health.    - - happy to teach where ever needed or develop a new course in her specialty area.\n\nShe is a Certified Instructor of the Crisis Prevention Institute’s Nonviolent Crisis Intervention Program.  (week long course). Focused on how to understand when patients/others becoming agitated and when to intervene in appropriate times.  Perhaps we might want to offer here at DUSON…..\n\n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\n\nSafety and health of patient care work force has been her passion for 9 years, and unfortunately there has been little changes.  Violence and muscular skeletal injuries are 2 important focus areas, and she wants to advance her research so that interventions and policies can be developed to impact nurses and patients.\n\n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?  - N/A\n\n\n10.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \n\nMost of her work is on vulnerable populations; e.g., poultry workers in rural eastern NC; this has enlightened her about the range of settings and circumstances that people are in. \n\nOutside work environment – was on a strategic planning committee for her church and did lots of outreach and research to identify  perspectives & needs for her congregation.\n\nShe and her family have been part of interexchange group for 6 years. They host student from another country. Au pair program (to nanny kids) but they come a J1 visa as student for cultural exchange.  Has enjoyed experience. Differences in culture immediately noticeable for meals, etc. …\n\n\n11.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?\n\nHas had luxury to been able to pick students to work with. She will need mentoring and support to be able to address the range of student needs/interests, and to manage a full class.  \n\nShe has an excellent grants administrator now. Will hope that we have that good research support. \n\nLooking forward to connecting with DUSON faculty on her research issues.  (Rachel note: Although not formally represented in current DUSON faculty research interests, I think that workforce safety and retention issues are highly relevant to nursing and should be of broad interest.) \n\n\n\n12.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\n\nNot a nurse so N/A. \n\nShe has gone to some of Duke’s work training programs. \nAlso became a Certified Instructor of the Crisis Prevention Institute’s Nonviolent Crisis Intervention Program. Focused on how to understand when patients/others becoming agitated and when to intervene in appropriate times.  Kind of like a certifications. Has tried to pitch the idea of Duke sponsoring  this training (and her to lead it) to the SOM / DUHS as a Duke course but they declined. Perhaps we might want to offer here at DUSON…..\nThis was a week long course. Originated from the health care industry (rather than academia). \n\n\n13.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\n14.\tDiscuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.\n\n15.\tAre you legally authorized to work in the U.S.?\n\n16.\tWill you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.)\n(If answer is no to question #15 or yes to question #16 let Crystal know.)\n\n\n\nNotes: Interview wanted to clarify her actual grant writing experience. She has written a great number and participated in many (where she is Epidemiologist). Many of her years at Duke were in positions where she did not have responsibility to write grants.  After the interview I am very impressed with her research program and ability to develop new ideas and work collaboratively.  ( I marked up her CV with my notes from her recitation of which grants she wrote and which ones spun off from what. I could not keep up on all my notes.)\nShe has gotten targeted expertise in gerontology here at DUSON from Kirtsen Corazinni. She looks forward to more collaboration with DUSON faculty on occupational issues. \n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:   RECOMMEND ON-CAMPUS Visit.  Ashley has participated in writing a number of grants and has received non-NIH funding form a number of sources, and completed those projects. She provided the most comprehensive and well articulated and ambitious research programs I have heard in one of these interviews.  She is also dedicated to her research, and has a clearly defined program of research and incredible enthusiasm.

Strength is her research, and she would like to be more visible with dissemination….\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nNot much time to develop teaching strategy and service.  Would like to explore new strategies for teaching – including gaming.  Rachel described the support for teaching that we have at DUSON.\n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nHer R01 award.  Funded through 2019.  She completed post doc in 2007 at UNC….R21 in 2010, then RO1 in 2014.  \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\nShe enjoys teaching although admittedly has less experience than desired.  Still she has taught a number of undergraduate and graduate classes at UAB School of Nursing.\n\na.\tClass size   - likes face-to-face and in-class teaching; live is better for her, although most all her teaching experience is online. \nb.\tClinical groups  -- no clinical teaching experience or desire.  \nc.\tOnline  - has plenty of experience\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy   -   She is committed to always provide Fast response on graded student papers and always gives EDITS and COMMENTS .. \nTeaching interests, what do you like about teaching, your philosophy?\nLikes both in class and online teaching…..feels in class teaching works better…..likes to do a lot of editing with student work…passion for “in depth” teaching….likes to stay in close contact with students and keeps strict deadlines for responding and giving feedback….feels like students deserve a lot of support and feedback.\nNo clinical teaching.\nMost of teaching has been research courses and stats., and would like to continue to teach those types of courses.\nKeeps current RN license, but does not practice clinically.\nHas not taught in DNP program – has taught mostly in PhD program.\n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nCurrent work through 2019 biochem measurements….developmental delays…..hopes to lead to development of screening tool for infants with a developmental disability, including autism spectrum disorders.\nWants to get an RO1 renewal – multisite. Also interested in autism research being done at Duke (outside of nursing). Would like to collaborate with a particular Duke investigator who has develope a mouse model for autism.\nShe has focused her career so far on “Show and tell” research to explain disease phenomena, but wants to move beyond Want to do deeper and high impact research. \n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nn/A\n10.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \nShe gave a great answer. Her research team has a couple of minority students – enjoys mentoring those students - would like to have cultural diversity among her team – feels it is helpful to “expand her mind and viewpoint” – also feels research participants are more comfortable with a research team that is not all white.\nBecause of the minority students on her team, she is thinking about writing an NICHD supplement grant to get tuition funds and stipend for minority students.\n\n\n11.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?\n\nCollbarotators.

There will be a six month delay in transfer of her grant funds when she leaves UAB. \nWould like to know how many courses she would have to teach….also wants to know what type of research/teaching time split she can negotiate. Her understanding is that she would need to teach one course per semester. Currently she has 45% research time for her RO1 work. Also asked about when she could start mentoring students. She has been a PhD student committee member, but has not served as a chair. \n\nIf she gets a campus visit, will she have the opportunity to meet with potential collaborators?\n\n\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:  \nRecommend campus visit.

No other peer-reviewed publications, or poster presentations except for dissertation. While his initial goal was to obtain a PhD in physiology he realized that he wanted to first make a significant & immediate clinical contribution and impact patients & students. Originally, he had not been close to academic centers that would allow him to develop scholarship. However, he has reached out to other scientific disciplines.

Learned very early on that traditional lecturing is not optimal. Blending traditional with creative non-traditional allows for more successful individualize learning experience.

Longer term: wants to change clinical practice, care teams, and make impact. His specific research / clinical goal is to develop:  “More intensive interventions with TEAMS and technology to reach more people. “\n\n\nHe framed this in terms of his life goals. History….  Has worked at U. Rochester for 30 years (redisency  PHD fellowships). Has gotten grants. Earlier research built qx first, and then build models around health behavior change from those models.  All around mental and physical health outcomes.  (Incidentally, he had the unique opp to train with George Engle (devl of biopsychosocial model).  Has also written/tested 5-6 interventions trying to build health outcomes.\n\nNow…. Trying to decide what to do with rest of career. Wants to work with at a high-level to expand models for health behavior change and MAINTENANCE.  The latter part is a big gap in the literature.  Sees many opportunities =- plus all the changes in health care going on make this drive a need for change.  It has been demonstrated that teams work well or better (i.e., Give more change / impact) than single clinician and he wants to build evidence and tools to support those teams.\n\nHe is Curious to design and test “virtual environment” around planning and goal adoption at home.  Then he REALLY wants to extend these tools to healthcare teams.  \nHe has developed and validated a qx on patient automony.  Believes this concept is critical to achieving patient centered outcomes.  He thinks we need to be looking in patient charts and EMRs and looking at documented measure and evidence of autonomy….  He asked me if Duke values importance of patient reported data…  and is the idea of collecting surveys from patients and integrating into Epic EHR on our horizon.  (An interesting question that indicates to be his readiness to incorporate his work into practice tools. )\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\n\nHe “grew’ up there …..  so, gets less attention (especially in terms of access to EHR or changes in process. \n\nHis children are growing up and he is open to a new place.  This is an opp for him to think “at this stage of my career are there new opportunities and where is the best place to achieve my goals. \n\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \nOpen to all options and this point.  Has visited the area and likes it. \n\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nHas trained lots of nurses and nurse practitioners, in addition to physicians, Pas, and other providers. Mostly tobacco, but now lipids and control.\nHe has taught medical interviewing  for many, many years (and points out that it could just as easily be nursing..) It is all about the quality of communication and patient needs.\nCommunication skills and training experience. As part of his teaching he watches video tapes and helps learners understand the quality and effectiveness of the communications. \nHe strongly believes that clinicians “get” something out of communications as well …    and he finds it rewarding and important to explore how both patients and providers benefit from good communication. \nIn his current care environment he works with 5 RDs. And gives feedback on their interviewing for diet qx data. \n\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\n(Sorry – I forgot to ask!)\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\nWorked with the American Academy of Health Care Communication, and I was honored to receive the George Engel award from that group several years ago. The Engel Award is presented annually for outstanding research contributing to the theory, practice and teaching of effective healthcare communication and related skills.\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size\nb.\tClinical groups\nc.\tOnline\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy – \n\nPhilosophy is embedded in Self Determin Theor.  He believes learners need to be introduced to the material, given enough structure to get them started, but then people need to have their own motivation to carry them through. He is “hands on”.\n\nTypically, he gives a lecture, assigns reading, demonstrate the interview; then he watches, and lets students tell him when they are ready to try …. \nHis dissertation was on how learning climates affect medical education …. (Interviewer note: very relevant to education and his research area.)\n\n______________________________________________\n\nHas not taught a semester long class.  He mostly teaches clinically. But, with that said he gives lots and lots of lectures.\n\nHe gives series of lectures each year to med students on behavior changes (~10 topics) and mindfulness teaching.  \nFor School of Pub health– 2-3 lectures per year. Will train any fellows (from cancer, endocrinology, …)  that ask each year.  People can come to him to get specific training as well.   (e.g., a psychologist from Portugal cam for a few weeks to learn teaching methods. Person from HIV clinic came over 3 months to learn specific behavior change motivation skills.) \n\nPreventative medicine residents – he gives feedback in terms of interviewing style.   \nEvery year he teaches medical interviewing  course – with standardized patients.  ~10 days a year.\n\nDoes most work of his teaching in graduate seminars (10 + years) – people read and bring projects and he presents feedback and suggestion. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nNeeds to de-stress primary care. .. and promote patients to adopt healthy behavior. Focused on building interventions to do this.\nSees lots of messaging and internet resources that are NOT helpful to patients. Example, FDA puts scary messages on meds. But does not give information on natural consequences of untreated disease.   So patients uninformed about drug choice.  Also they are under-informed about the impact of lifestyle on disease.  Behavior change can have a bigger impact then meds but not well described or promoted.\nMed adherence, exercise, smoking .. diet….  Those are hard … \nWANTS to bring these messages, and care teams together. ..  Choose CV area because they are common , and we have lots of meds and behaviors to change….\nIt is limitation of contact time that clinicians have with patients.  How make most of that.  Has created 5 virtual clinicians.  They can substitutes for real clinicians (not as well, of course) and take some of the time burden off them. Wants to evaluate them and put into real use.\n\nWe need good data.  His access to EMR has been difficult at UR …  He wonders if that would be different at another institution..\n(Interviewer Note: his language through the interview made it clear that he is very cognizant of care team members (nurse, doc, PA, pharmacists ) and roles, and seems to value them all.)\n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nn/a\n10.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)   \n\nGreat question and fully supportive of diversity. For example in his virtual tools, he has long thought that it could be adapted to appeal to different audiences . And can test if it is best to match people on race, age, culture.\n\nFundamental issues of race, justice and autonomy are important in any discussion of diversity.\n\nAutonomy is a human need that touches all races and cultures.  Autonomy might be enhanced or not for some populations or cultures.  This can undermine motivations …. If do not attend to important needs.  Has looked at smoking intervention effectiveness in black vs white communities.  Would like to conduct future research to see if sense of autonomy is related to different responses to behavior interventions.\n\nLoves working with people of different cultures. Has worked with people from all different cultures and sees differences worth exploring further.\n\n11.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?\nWould love to have a (Motivation/psychs)  lab where he can test this out. All CV guidelines have changed from risk levelts. But no one knows how patietns react to that.  \nWould need a team to work with him, or psychometrics/stats .  Does not need his own FTE for these  but access to this kind of expertise.\n\nNeed access to EMR.  Access to make changes and ….\nHealth Services researchers and health economist to help measure cost effectivess of interventions he wants to propose.  \n\n12.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\n\nHe does not know all opportunities .. so that is his job to understand them. But when pressed for an early guess of his priorities:\nWould spend 30% time clinically and the rest research or teaching. The cutting edge is how to bring interventions into clinical world and he wants to do whatever combination of research and teaching that can facilitate that.\nFocus: Smoking cessation, lipids, hypertension, physical activity. \n\n13.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nClarify experience with Nursing students and faculty/researchers:\n\nFor all 3 nursing PHD students that he mentioned in his letter, he was an official listed member, but never the chair. The chair had to be in primary dept as student… So, he did not qualify. He was on each committee because they wanted Self Determination theory expertise.\nHis appt is in the Med School, although he has had adjunct appt to the SON over the years.  (Can’t remember what years or if current.)\n\nDarryl Minicuchi (Sharp), RN, PhD,  has been a collaborator of his since 1989.  And she is on a number of papers with him.  She could be a reference if we want to call her. He was on her committee.  Her dissertation was on Self Determination Theory.  Now they are colleagues.\nHe served as an informal medical consultant for the medical screen program  (working with the Assoc Daean at School of Nursing at the time.)\n\nHe thinks that NP more open to motivation theory than most docs. He has worked with advanced practice (PA and NP) providers in his practice for years.  He is the Collaborating physician for Darryl (NP) .  She is a psych nurse NP. He is not certified in Psychiatry but has had psych training.\n\nHe is about to start (survivorship program) in Cancer Program, he will be working to train the new NP that they hire regarding lipids, smoking, etc. They are promoting a lifestyle program for patients who smoke.\nHe has trained NP in the HIV community to develop strategies to deal with smoking cessation in HIV-infected communities. (High prevalence of smoking.  Big issue because it lowers immune system, but they get a different form of atheroschlerosis.  ..)\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\n\nDiscuss in search committee.  If there is issue of “fit” or need/preference for a nursing degree then that needs to be determined before inviting him. \nI suggest continued recruitment and campus visit. This candidate is clearly an established and competent researcher with demonstrated success in external funding. He is still actively writing a number of grants and has high likelihood of success.  His expertise and training align with important educational and research needs of DUSON. \nAfter the phone interview, I found this applicant to be pleasant and unassuming and very focused and passionate about his research interests. I felt that he had an understanding and genuine respect for nursing research and advanced and independent practice. I think he would work well with faculty at DUSON and in Duke, and would add a valuable component to teaching and research activities here.  Based on his comments, I see immediate opportunities for collaboration with DUSON faculty in: informatics, oncology, CV, medication adherence (Bradi Granger), diabetes, and HIV. He has 30 years of medical experience working with providers of all types and patients. His experience teaching medical interviewing and PhD in psychology could benefit a number of nursing courses here.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1459","CandID":"591","CommenterInitials":"CCH","DateOfComment":"2015-06-03T00:00:00","Comment":"CONFIDENTIAL\nFaculty Search Committee\nApplicant Reviewer Worksheet                                                     \n\nApplicant :     Brett Howard\t             \t\t\t Position:  Psych NP\n\n\n***CV does not include teaching experience and scholarship program.

If otherwise, append these information to his CV and I recommend a phone screen.\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity. (see below)\n\n2.\tFocused program of research or scholarship\nHis CV did not contain any information about program of scholarship. Candidate obtained PhD in in Psychology from Alliant University in 2003 and it is odd that he did not even list his dissertation as an evidence of scholarly work.  I am hoping that this  is only an oversight on his part (although a major oversight, I must say!).

Started as a research psychologist then behavioral consultant then was an Intelligence Officer for the US Intelligence Service 2005-07 and was even deployed to Baghdad. Back to the States, realized he can do more to advocate for mental health care, went back to school to be a nurse. Became a nurse in 2010 then Pysch NP in 2013. Been in clinical practice as psych NP since 2013 .\n\n6.\tService to the profession (see above, I do not see any membership to professional organizations mentioned in CV).\n\n7.\tJob stability – been in his position since 2013\n\n8.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON \nClearly, he brings expertise in mental health.  He is also knowledgeable about veterans’ needs and he will be able to contribute immediately to the Psych NP training grant that Duke and Durham VAMC has.  I am hoping that his CV is incomplete and he just did not include teaching experience and scholarship program. This needs to be verified with the applicant.\n\n9.\tCommitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \nHis exposure to the military has afforded him opportunities to the many mental health needs of the veterans. In his letter, he stated that he will provide training on depression to NP members of the AANP DC Chapter. In November, he will also be talking to a group of physicians who are members of the American College of Physicians DC Chapter.\n\n10.\tIf this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification):\n**needs to obtain information about his program of scholarship (pubs, grants) and teaching experience. The info derived should be appended to his CV\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  \nRecommend that Crystal calls to verify if indeed he has teaching experience, pubs, and scholarly work. This is a clinically strong candidate with an interesting career background (behavioral health counselor then,  PhD, then Intelligence Officer in the Army, then Nursing, then Psych NP). If he indeed lacks teaching experience, pubs, and program of scholarship, he can be considered for an Instructor track  but I do not think that we are offering that. And for this reason, no phone screen.\n\nIf with pubs/research and teaching experience, then go ahead with phone screen.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1460","CandID":"590","CommenterInitials":"PT","DateOfComment":"2015-06-05T00:00:00","Comment":"Dr. Wall is a Commander, Nurse Corps, United States Navy and will retire from the Navy in the Summer of 2016.\n\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity.\nGrants: Received military funding, TriService Research Grant, 34K, most likely for dissertation work\n\tPubs: 4 with one first author.

Has been at Univ of Colorado since 2011 - as a post-doc, and now assistant professor (since 2013).  There is a very odd and suspicious gap in his doctoral work (“*Progress to doctoral degree terminated in spring 2003 due to abrupt loss of research funds in sponsoring department.) for 2 years.  Then he does a second MSN in Nursing Educations.  A strange progression of majors and jobs over the years and no clear focus.\n\n8.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON  - None\n\n9.\tCommitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \nNone evident.  Cover letter states: “Finally, the focus on diversity and the individual student at Duke University resonates with my values as an educator and an under-represented minority in nursing; I believe you would find me to be a strong asset to the School.”\n\n10.\tIf this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): None.\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  \n\nCease recruitment. I see no evidence of successful program of research or external funding. No central themes to his publications and presentation and no articulation of his research objectives.  No presentation or publication in any venue that has any connection to nursing, public health, or translational research. I do not see where he would contribute specifically to DUSON, and certainly I see no potential for independent external funding.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1465","CandID":"593","CommenterInitials":"MLA","DateOfComment":"2015-07-01T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :  Thomas Hill             \t\t\t Position:  Senior  Nurse Researcher  (SrNR)\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity.\nSrNR Position announcement clearly states: “Eligible candidates will have a well-established program of funded research and will be eligible for appointment at the Associate Professor or Professor rank with tenure”.\n\nThere is no clear record of established, current or potential NIH research funding in the post-doctoral setting base on the material presented. Based on these data alone that indicates lack of sustainability I recommend to cease recruitment.\n\nResearch Funding:\nCandidate lists 2 graduate basic science fellowships (in pharmacology for drug development and pulmonary immunology) and one pre-doctoral fellowship (in toxicology) without clear funding source.\nUC-Davis probably sponsored the pre-doctoral and graduate fellowships. It is possible that the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences funded some of his fellowships (via research training program). Received a student award.\n\nNo current grants in review.

Investigations in population based, in vitro and ex vivo systems.\n\nAs Assistant Professor of Nursing with the University of Northern Colorado, he began developing a proposal for a translational research program investigating environmental impacts on the innate immune defense of the lung due to the ingestion of heavy-metal/metalloid contaminated drinking water. While he maintains that his research interests include translational clinical components. His initial email clearly states: “While I enjoyed my former academic position, my ultimate goal is a research and teaching position with an active bench laboratory component.”\n\nLimited scholarship as required for this position as noted above.

Mr. Hill has been an Assistant Professor for ~ 2 years.\n\nHe worked At the University of California- Davis for 13 year as a nurse and 1 year as a nurse intern.\n\nInteresting MSN to doctoral education trajectory which was interrupted due to lack of funding. He changed from a doctorate in Nursing to a PhD in Pharmacology and Toxicology after completed his MSN.\n\n8.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON\nLimited in the SrNR position as stated.\n\n9.\tCommitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities).  Candidate is an “under-represented minority\".  He has “specific cross cultural preparation (? Source document) and reads both German and Spanish.” \n\nMr. Hill is developing a proposal for a translational research program investigating environmental impacts on the innate immune defense of the lung due to the ingestion of heavy-metal/metalloid contaminated drinking water.

As such he proposes that his research “addresses community health issues and nursing concerns relevant to rural and underserved populations that may affect both incidence and persistence of upper respiratory infections in healthy or compromised individuals.\n\nCover letter states: “Finally, the focus on diversity and the individual student at Duke University resonates with my values as an educator and an under-represented minority in nursing; I believe you would find me to be a strong asset to the School.” \n\n10.\tIf this candidate is to have a phone screen, what additional questions would be asked (e.g., certification): \nNot applicable\n\nReviewer’s Recommendation and rationale:  \n\nCease recruitment primarily due to a lack of well-established program of funded or potentially funded research in the post-doctoral setting which indicates lack of sustainability at this point in his career. Mr. Hill’s limited publications and presentations are focused on bench research. While he has established experience as a nurse and in teaching and in developing curriculum (including  pharmacology, pathophysiology) at a school of nursing there is limited evidence that his research has been translated to clinical, nursing or community health at this time.

Certainly, she was very thoughtful or forthcoming in all her responses and understandable from my perspectives.) \n\nShe also added as far as another weakness… Perhaps her work with triangulation of methods have perhaps made her research skills in a tad weaker in quantitative or qualitative than if she had focused her research exclusively on one method.  \n\n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?\n\nHer research program and her R01’s that have been funded:\n2007-2013 PI, NIH/NINR, R01, “Ethnic-specific Midlife Women’s Attitudes toward Physical Activity.”\n$1.84 million (R01 NR010568).\n\n2005-2011 PI, NIH/NINR/NIA, R01, “A Multiethnic Internet Study on Menopausal Symptoms,” $1.2\nmillion (R01 NR008926).\n\n2003-2009 PI, NIH/NINR/NCI, R01, “Cancer Pain Management-Decision Support Computer\nProgram,” $ 1.8 million (R01 NR007900).\n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size – Ideal class size is 10-15, but she has taught classes up to 25 students.\n\nb.\tClinical groups  -  N/A\n\nc.\tOnline – has used hybrid methods, such as online discussion that is later followed up with live class discussion. Has never done exclusively online teaching.\n\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy\nUses feminist perspective; she has had a history of good teaching evaluations from students; her classes tends to be relaxed and she does not set up situations for students to challenge each other,  but does try to stimulate their learning and processing of complex ideas. She also uses a lot of multi – media tools in her classes.\n\nDesired courses she could teach at DUSON:\nResearch methods, Nursing theory (has taught for 20 years); international and global health; community health; women’s health issues\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nIf NIA does not want the Ro1 could be transferred to NINR, and it is in their funding range.\nNot sure if it will be funded at this point so she cannot begin the transfer yet.  Also she is not sure if there is a minimum of 1 year on NIH grant before it can be transferred from UPenn to Duke. \nShe is also working on 2 more applications related to depression in Korean Americans ; maybe by October she can submit them. Not sure.\nI asked if she had applied for PCORI funding, and she has in the past but has not been funded. Hard to address review comments from patients on the review panels. She is a standing member of PCORI research panel .\n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?   N/A\n\n10.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \n\nHer research has focused by definition on different cultures and ethnicities and the impact of these factors on individuals’ healthcare behaviors, experience and outcomes.\n\nShe was awarded a minority supplement:\n2005-2011 PI, NIH/NINR/NIA, R01 Minority Supplement for Maresha Clark, “A Multiethnic Internet\nStudy on Menopausal Symptoms,” (3 R01 NR008926-01-02S1).\n\n…for the R01 grant listed below. Further, for that particular R01 study, she purposefully identified a student that represented each ethnic group studied in the research and worked with them to develop and deliver the proposed research data collection.  \n\n2007-2013 PI, NIH/NINR, R01, “Ethnic-specific Midlife Women’s Attitudes toward Physical Activity.”\n$1.84 million (R01 NR010568).\n\n\n\n11.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?\nTime for research, infrastructure to develop center grants; opportunities to network with other researchers; perhaps pilot funding to support her development of R01.\n\n12.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\n\nNot practicing ; Has maintained certification in CA for Comm Health Nursing \n\n\n13.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\nShe is interested in a number of populations and could conduct her studies in this geographic area if she were to relocate here.  \n\nAside from NIH grant apps in review, she will not bring any current funding with her, as she holds a number of smaller pilot study grants that would be wrapped up before she came here.  She was concerned that an award specialist from Duke would help her transfer R01(s) here should she get the award(s) in the next few months. She is not sure if she would need to start the research and have the award for 1 year before she came here. I told her that we would certainly assign someone to help her with this, and all could be negotiated with the Dean if the position was offered.\n\n\n14.\tDiscuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.\n\nDr. Im does not appear to be in a hurry, and seemed surprised and flattered when I told her that we would respond as best we could to meet her timelines or if she had a sense of urgency (or other potential job offers).   (My instinct is that she has not applied for other faculty positions at this time.)\n\nIn response to her desired start/relocation date if she was offered the position, Dr. Im said she thought she might be required to give 1-year notice for her school to leave her current position.  She needs to check that and will do so soon.  So, at this time, she is not sure what a realistic start date might be.\n\nGiven that, I asked her preferred timeline for a campus visit if the committee decides to extend an invitation to her (i.e., sooner or later).  She asked our preference, and wondered if summer would be a hard time to schedule.  I said it probably made sense for her to come sooner rather than later for the visit and the actual start dates could be negotiated if there seems to be a good match for her here.  We agreed that September might be good month to target for a 1-2 day campus visit, given the following:\n Aug 13-24. – She will be in Korea.\nSept -- > open most days but Mondays \nOct  - & Nov  Possible but tend to be busier and harder to schedule for a number of reasons.\n\n15.\tAre you legally authorized to work in the U.S.?\n\nYes .  She is a U.S. Citizen.\n\n16.\tWill you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.)   No.\n\n17.\tPlease rate the candidate in the areas related to diversity and inclusion listed below, adding additional comments, if needed.  \n\n\tPoor\tFair\tGood\tExcellent\tUnable to rate\n\na.\tPromotes diversity and inclusion among student populations.    Rating = Excellent\nComments: \n\nSure – she says her research on diverse ethnic and cultural groups caries over into the classroom. She was awarded an R01 student minority supplem  for an African American student. She uses theories from her multi-ethnic research in the classroom and is confident that she address and promotes diversity and inclusion more than most faculty members at this time.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nContinue with recruitment.  She is a strong candidate, has a clearly established program of research, numerous publications and strong grant history.  She is an excellent and dedicated educator, and very pleasant on the telephone.  \nFor a number of reasons, I do not think she has a sense of urgency about this position (maybe she wants to start in 1 year….) but I think we should schedule a campus visit to determine if this is a match and to begin discussion on timelines for the position. September seems like a good month to target but she is flexible for whatever timeline we propose. I told her to contact us at any point if her situation changes and she wants us to move more quickly.","CommentTag":"0"},{"CommentID":"1471","CandID":"596","CommenterInitials":"MBM","DateOfComment":"2015-07-26T00:00:00","Comment":"Applicant :        Carrie Palmer\t\t\t Position:  AG NP (VA)\n\n\nAreas of Evaluation\n\n1.\tResearch funding and publication productivity appropriate? for career stage (summarize)\n\nNo funding reported.

Be supported in her desire to teach and be a clinician and have strong DNP clinical faculty as mentors.\n5.\tWhat are your strengths?\n“A starter” likes to get things up and running, then mentor folks into sustaining those projects.\n“Started the program at the capitol” to get NPs to be health care providers\nLikes the challenge of establishing something new\nPersistent and passionate about advanced practice, increased access to health care and the NP role\n6.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nCould be considered a weakness, that once something is ‘up and running’ that she likes to hand it off to be sustained.  Likes to start things, teach colleagues to be proficient at maintaining the project, and then move on to start or evaluate something else.  start a program then hand it off…\nWon’t quit – very persistent, sometimes tunnel vision if passionate about a project\n7.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?  (OWNED OWN PRACTICE)\nProfessionally: in state when NPs don’t have good regulations- she had a primary care practice that was well respected. Took care of GLBTQ and those patients felt accepted\nInsurance reimbursement was too difficult for her to maintain this practice and send her adult child to college. Chose to close the practice and went to become director of legislative health services and legislative NP. \nAlso feels she’s had a strong impact on the NPs of PA as an advocate for the role. Has been active and provided leadership to the PA Coalition of NPs since 2005.\n\n8.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size -  enjoys both lecturing and having students in clinical. \nb.\tClinical groups – feels comfortable with 1:1 precepting but also enjoys coordinating the learning experience of several clinical students\nc.\tOnline – limited experience with this as a teacher – has limited access to the technology to offer this. Her Doctoral program was ‘on-line’ so has experience as a student.  Enjoys lecturing, enjoys sharing clinical experiences and ‘precepting’ / exposing NP students to clinical opportunities and mentoring students in the clinical area\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy –“ If students understand ‘why’ – they will understand the importance of doing what their doing correctly. Teach so others understand ‘why’  then they will become expert at ‘how’”\n\n9.\t(combined with question #11) What are your research interests? Program of research plans?/ You have listed several different honors and presentations on CV – how would you summarize your area of scholarship interest. And what resources do you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing your scholarship interests?\n-\tVery interested in moving DNP pilot forward and expanding on it to integrating technology into areas of caregiver support – want to recognize and emphasize value of ‘stay-at-home’ caregivers.\n-\tEstablishing a program of ‘respite care’ for care givers.  A lot of care-giving of disabled veterans falls back on their families.\n-\tColleagues in AANP (Fellows) for transition. Clinical responsibilities would help her connect\n\n10.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project? (graduated may 2014) Enjoyed the work she did with caregiver support-group. (DNP project) Presented it at DNP conference as a podium presentation (she told me this during the phone interview – I couldn’t find it on her CV as a presentation, but also didn’t ask her to expand on this presentation any further).  DNP work was a Pilot study – would like to work on that and expand that, not currently in a position to be able to do that as she is currently limited by lack of technology resources.\n“Technology is the way we need to connect” – would like to be in an environment where there were experts/resources in technology to be able to move this forward\n\n11.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \n“A significant portion” of her primary care practice was GLBTQ.  Provided support groups and education out of her practice.  Was active with the community for her practice to partner and support opening an AIDS community alliance.  Also in her work with ‘care-givers’ she recognizes that there is a great deal of diversity in the notion of family (gender, ethnicity) and feels fortunate as a primary care provider to have been able to have a very diverse patient population \n\n12.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?\nHas “always found a way to be involved with the profession, and teach but it’s been in addition to full-time clinical work”  looks forward to being in an academic setting, having the opportunity for career to include not only the opportunity for but expectation of teaching, scholarship and practice. Discussed that having other DNP/clinical faculty as role-models and support to bring teaching and practice into balance. \n\n13.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\nFNP – ANCC and Emergency Nurse Practitioner (only available since October 2014) – goal to maintain both of those.

Most course-development and classroom experience with Widener University.  Worked with developing courses to be offered at the Harrisburg campus. Dr. Bock and the program director designed the pathophysiology course (case-study approach) for the other campus.  Also taught physical assessment and professional issues course – has been both responsible for whole courses and been guest lecturer.   \nHas done clinical teaching of all kinds of professionals (EMT, nurses, NPs) and precepted students in the ED, primary care, etc\n3.\tWhat are your scholarship goals and what would help you attain those?\nDid not address the position specifically in cover letter. Only one comment in the cover letter re: Veterans – what does she understand the practice/teaching/administrative aspect of this position to be?\n\tHow has the experience in her current position prepared her for this position?\n“certainly have to be flexible when you work in a place where politics is the norm” – owning own business and working with government has helped her know when and under what circumstances don’t allow for compromise ie. Patient safety. And learning how to advocate for patients and patient populations that are underserved, what is best, what is ethical and what is fiscally responsible\nArt of Compromise!\n\n15.\tDiscuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.\nMission trip to Honduras in October \nWould want to give her employers a month’s notice.

She believes this is stress.   \n\n2nd interest area– prevention /intervention for intimate partner violence. Most work is community based participatory research. She has done a lot of this.  But would like to do more. She feels ready to pull out of her community research in Miami and know that she has made an impact there. ..  Now she wants to explore new ideas and implement them in “different” Hispanic populations. \n\n2.\tWhy are you interested in a new faculty position? (If they are currently in a position)\nN/A\n3.\tWhy are you interested in a faculty position at Duke?  \n\nDuke has faculty doing bio-psychosocial type research.  Interested in impact on Telomeres and she thinks her NINR funding options will be higher here. \nWants to be in an environment with more research and have …. More time to do that.\nDespite that her interests are very well-aligned with her current school of nursing in Miami, she wants to be exposed to more diversity and different ways of thinking – to stimulate diversity.  Wants to be in a new and diverse environment and wants to brings multi-disciplinary perspectives. \nAlso, in her school there are only 7 tenured faculty (including the Dean).  She is taking on more leadership roles than she thinks she should at this point in her professional / research development.  She spends about 60% of time leading mentioning programs to encourage new students to get into health disparities and mentoring PhD students but she feels that she should be more focused on her research.\n4.\tWhat are your strengths?\nIs a “very warm and happy person”. Therefore she is flexible and positive. Can adapt to challenges and enjoy successes. So she thrives on different environment and change.\n5.\tWhat are your weaknesses?\nAssociated weakness is that she can at times be overly optimistic, and at times can be disappointed if things do not work out. Her enthusiasm for new opportunities can lead her to over-commitments. \n6.\tWhat is your most significant accomplishment?  (She has 2 accomplishments to report – 1 for research and one for service.)\n\n1.) research - the community based participatory relationship she has promoted in her community related to EBP for intimate partner violence. This took a lot of time and energy to build. She is proud of community partnership (and its impact); and the fact that she has managed to get research publications out of it.\n\n2.) service – Was on the IOM Committee for Future of Nursing. She was worried at first about her potential/ability to contribute to the committee. But she was proud hat she did add to the report and initiative. She worked ion diversity of Nursing Workforce and using nursing to reduce impact of health disparities.  She has now seen the impact of that report on communities and grant funding, and she is proud of \n\n7.\tWhat is your teaching passion?\na.\tClass size\nb.\tClinical groups\nc.\tOnline\nd.\tDiscuss teaching philosophy\nHas had a lot of experience teaching across programs and levels. Undergrad. Diadactic and clinical. Teaches a lot with MSPH graduate students. And developed  that program. \nAlso has taught some in PhD program.\n\nShe enjoys Pubic health nursing, research, and health disparities. Those are where she has more to offer.  She likes small classes better but can do large.\n\nEnjoys most the mentorship component to exposing students to research for the first time. She likes working with them 1:1.  Likes to break stereotype that research removes nurse from care – community research can be engaging and have IMPACT on pt care.\n\nTeaching philosophy – best strategy for learning is teaching. So she likes to encourage students to play a role in the teaching (in class_).\n\nHas done some online teaching several (>5) years ago.  Was a distance based.  In BSN.  Has done synchronous online teachings. \n\n8.\tWhat are your research interests? Program of research plans?\nSubmitted R01 (NINR) in October 2015  (Aims: to explore the longitudinal relationships among acculturation, stress, health promotion practices, biological aging (as measured by telomere length) and health status among Hispanic immigrants.)\nShe wants to move forward program of research around understanding impact of unique mix of stressors that Hispanic immigrants face and how can programs address those. First she wants to understand the etiology of problems and then develop intervention and then evaluate their efficacy.\nVery interested in role of context of these stressors. E.g., in Miami, Hispanics are the majority but in NC not much. How are health outcomes differ… \n\nWill come here with no current funding. \nCurrent funding all relates to training. Has a big T37 grant (Through Office of Minority Health….) .   5 year grant. \nAlso has a supplement to a health disparities research center (HIV/survivors of intimate partner violence. Doing data analysis and publications now.\n\n\n9.\tFor recent DNP graduates, what are plans for publishing your capstone project?\nN/A\n10.\tPlease discuss your commitment to diversity and intercultural development (e.g., committees, populations studied, service teaching, activities)  \n\n\n11.\tWhat resources would you anticipate needing to be successful in continuing/establishing your program of research (for researcher candidates)/ for continuing/establishing your scholarship (for  non-researcher candidates)?\nMentorship, particularly in biomarker research.  In Miami she formed relationship with a geneticist.  \nShe would need funding support until her grants get funded.\nAccess to labs for her research.  \n\nSomeone that can help her connect to local community agencies. \n\n12.\tWhat are your practice interests; do you intend to continue practicing; what certification do you hold and will you maintain it?\n\nClinical specialty is advanced practice public health nursing. There is a certification (CPH) which she has. She does not have Adv Practice PH certification because it is not well-recognize but she can pursues. .\n\n13.\tIntegrate any issues or questions that arose in review of the application by the committee members.\n\n14.\tDiscuss candidate’s time frame and time frame for next steps in recruitment.\nNo urgency.  Anxious for a visit soon.  Move would have to time out with children’s school time. \n\n15.\tAre you legally authorized to work in the U.S.? yes\n\n16.\tWill you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for employment VISA status? (J-1, H-1B,o-1, green card, etc.)\n\n17.\tPlease rate the candidate in the areas related to diversity and inclusion listed below, adding additional comments, if needed.  \n\n\tPoor\tFair\tGood\tExcellent\tUnable to rate\na.\tPromotes diversity and inclusion among student populations.  \nComments: \n\nIs very concerned with lack of diversity in nursing student population.  In particularly the Hipsanic are 5% of nursing student pop (and 16% pop at large). Has worked on a number of diversity initiatives. Florida Blue Fnd to diversify students in nursing, particualrty PhD.  \n\nActive at pogram level and policy level (IOM; NCNEP committee recommendations to congress). \n\nIs aware that just because students in class does not mean their needs are being met. Tries to bring this issue to faculty attention. \nArticulate about what diversity means – more than just racial/ethnic/gender.  Also, diversity of thought. \n\nCan speak to theme of inclusion. \n\nRead our diversity statement and likes our r\t\t\t\t\nX\t\n\n\nCommittee member’s recommendation and rationale:\nInvite for campus visit soon. She is passionate and articulate about her research. Committed to diversity and inclusion. Demonstrated expert in Community-based participatory research.\nShe has great potential and shows success in grant writing and project mgt. But, needs to move her funding from training and workforce development to the R-level research grants.\nAlthough she has no current and no history of “pure research” funding, she clearly has leadership and collaborative potential and grantsmanship skills and a VERY HIGH probability of successful and independently funded research career. \nShe would be a great asset to DUSON.","CommentTag":"0"}]},{"table":"tbl_eval","json":[{"evalNum":"1","CandID":"12","DateOfVisit":"2008-10-30T00:00:00","EvalCompleter":"Others","AcadTrain":"3","LevSchPro":"1","LikeSecExFunding":"1","UnderCurriIss":"2","VisInnLeadCurri":"2","LikSecTrainGrFun":"1","AbilityRepSchool":"1","ManInterConSchool":"1","ExAbilityPart":"1","RecForHire":"0","Qualitative":"I was unimpressed with the candidate mostly because of his unconventional background and his personal style.

He wants to come in as a tenured assoc. prof., but in the list of \"Refereed Papers\" 20 of what are listed as papers are actually conference proceedings, so it appears that he is including podium presentations as refereed papers, which is incorrect.  Out of 48 \"refereed papers,\" 20 are conference proceedings.  Therefore he comes nowhere near meeting the criteria for assoc. prof with tenure.  He has had very little R level funding given the length of his career.

She also has very few publications and indicated in at least one conversation that she does not desire to be on the tenure track here due to not wanting to work at that level.

I appreciate being given the opportunity to hear her presentation and to meet with her in a small group format. However, I am of the opinion that Dr. Ward would not be a good addition to the DUSON faculty at any level or in any role. Her CV suggests a lack of significant experience of the caliber expected of Du ke faculty. Her only teaching experience has been in a diploma program, except for some remidiation work related to NCLEX review/preperation.She has one publication, 2 pages in length, although she indicates that her dissertation work is in progress. She has a very limited number of presentations of national or even statewide significance. More than half of the presentations she has listed have either been made at churches or her places of employment, while both are important venues they suggest a lack of significant professional development or comittment one would expect of a Duke faculty. While such a significant lack of professional or scholarly contributions could be overlooked in a less seasoned educator, I would expect more from a person at Dr. Ward's point in career development. In meeting with her after her presentation I found it concerning that she is interested in a clinical track position because she \"has a lot going on in (her) life and does not want to have to worry about funding and publications\". That statement, matched with a  CV rather weak in professional substance, causes me to wonder what level of contribution this candidate will make at Duke. While I enjoyed Dr. Ward's presentation I found that it lacked the intellectual sophistcation or intrigue one might expect from a faculty member at Duke. I left feeling that her understanding of her subject matter and methodology were rather basic for a doctorally prepared academician and that the dissertation had been more driven by process and necessity than by a spirit of intellectual inquiry. There was no \"wow factor\" to the presentation nor could I find much value in her studies results or her explanation of how they might inform practice or education. \nI know that we are facing a serious and pressing need for additional ABSN faculty, however I hope that we will not allow that to influence hiring decisions when a candidate is not adequately prepared or qualified to be on faculty at Duke. Our students expect and deserve faculty who, in addition to having doctoral education,  have made some level of significant contributions to our profession through both scholarship and leadership. Despite the fact that Dr. Ward appears to be a lovely woman, I have significant concerns about her ability to make more than mediocre academic and intellectual contributions here at Duke. I have concerns that she may not be academically or intellectually on par with our students, and most of the faculty at DUSON or Duke.  I am hopeful that we will continue to look for faculty who can not only foster the intellectual development of our students but also make significant scholarly contributions toward the enhancement of DUSON's reputation as a leading academic institution.   To that end we need  faculty, who like our students, are exceptional rather than mediocre or average.

She has been successful with modest resources but recognizes the impact that greater infrastructure and resources can have in transforming translational research goals. Dr. Granger's vision is centered on high-impact and innovative target areas in cardiovascular care, which matches well with the expertise at Duke University and the Medical Center, and will help to strengthen the School's involvement in this area. Her model for building translational research can also be extended to other core areas, such as oncology, health care services/outcomes, neonatal/pediatric and aging research, to name a few. She is keenly focused on developing the DNTI as a conduit for which bedside nurses, researchers/faculty, students, postdoc trainees, and multidisciplinary colleagues) can synthesize knowledge, experience, and effort towards common goals.

Should she be offered the position she would balance out the ABSN faculty by being another strong researcher to join Relf, Brion & Bailey…and to balance out Martin, Gordon, Phillips, Turner. I think we not only need this depth and breath…but her enthusiasm and professional credentials.  I quite enjoyed my time with her during the presentation, 1:1, ABSN faculty time and dinner. I see her being a very ++ addition to DUSON and to the ABSN core group. \n     Where she is going to need some effort is to reaquaint herself with the role/skills of the bedside nurse and the issues in pediatrics. It is important that she not teach the peds material from the platform of an advanced practice nurse, but rather from the generalist perspective.

I believe the change to a general pediatrics focus in the ABSN program would be a significant change for her, and while there certainly would be opportunities for her to pursue her clinical research interests, from the ABSN position perspective the majority of her work would be in community and general pediatrics.  While her presentation style could be enhanced, it was a topic of importance and she demonstrated some core pedagogical skills related to developing interest, logical flow, etc.  She did however try to cover way too much information in too much detail and that detracted from the session.  Dr. Wise's background in oncology would be of value to the school as would her PNP credential and experience, which if capacity were needed could be of value in the MSN and potentially DNP programs.

I called all 5 and have heard back from 4 of them – 2 folks from SUNY New Paltz (his current position), 1 from Seton Hall (his doctoral dissertation chair), and 1 from Southern CT State U (where he worked for 2 years).  The 1 I’ve not yet heard from is the nursing dean at Seton Hall (where he worked for 4 years while completing his doctorate at that school … not in nursing).  I left her a message a week ago and will follow up with her if you think it’s needed.  I think I’ve heard very consistent messages (except for 1 concern) and follow up with this person is not necessary, but I’ll do it if the group wishes.  \n\nOverall, the references for Scott are excellent.  He is described (by almost everyone) as a fabulous teacher whom students (undergraduate & graduate) love … a good role model, particularly for the male students … easy to get along with … motivated … someone who inspired others in his doctoral program to move forward … a team player … collegial (in fact, his doctoral dissertation chair and he are working on a paper together) … someone who mentored fellow doctoral students who were earlier in their program (without being asked or required to do that) … able to interact positively with everyone … thought provoking … someone who inspires dialogue … passionate about the clinical nursing environment and what enhances it … up to date regarding clinical practice … someone who earned the respect of fellow faculty and those outside the university … flexible … willing to “jump in” when things need to be done … dependable … someone who puts things in good, healthy perspective … someone with a “strong presence” … versatile … tech savvy … someone who can use humor effectively ... an experienced teacher whose “hand does not need to be held” …calm … and energetic.\n\nThe individual who was the dean at Southern CT State U when Scott was there described some concern.  She said he was hired initially on a tenure track line.  He worked well but then was paired with a faculty member who was not “carrying her weight” in the course.  Rather than working to deal with that situation, Scott resigned.  Within a short time after resigning, he called the dean, saying he wanted to come back.  By that time, it was too late for him to come back to the tenure track line, so he was hired on a 1-year appointment and encouraged to apply for tenure track while on that appointment.  Scott never did apply for the tenure track position and left again (and permanently) after that second year.  This dean expressed concern that he is “unpredictable” and unable or unwilling to deal with conflict, particularly with faculty colleagues.  I wanted to share this since it was information I gleaned from the reference, but I do want to point out that none of the other references made any comments that were at all along these lines.  \n\nFinally, when asked what they thought Scott’s greatest contribution to DUSON could be if he were appointed, I received the following responses:  thought provoking … ability to bring in grant funding if mentored … experience as a teacher … some involvement at the university level, so knows the “bigger picture” at least a bit … ability and willingness to inspire and mentor others … clinical expertise … and leadership and management skills.  Except for the concern noted above, everyone else said they had no hesitation to recommend Scott, and they saw no real weaknesses in him."},{"RefCheckID":"113","CandID":"84","RefCheckInitials":"TV","ReferenceName":"Phyllis Hansell","DateOfCheck":"2009-05-27T00:00:00","ReferenceText":"Dr. Hansell is the dean of the SON at Seton Hall, where Scott taught for a few years while he was completing his PhD (in a department outside nursing).  Dr. Hansell said she never observed Scott teaching, but the students liked him, he is \"entertaining,\" and on RateMyProfessor he gets good \"marks\" from students … She said he should be \"fine\" in the classroom, and his experience teaching ABSN students should be helpful for the position we are seeking to fill.  She also said the faculty liked him, he got along well with collegues, and was actively involved in the work of the school.  In terms of scholarship, Dr. Hansell noted that she did not think Scott could \"hit the ground running\" and would need mentoring and guidance to develop and pursue a program of research; however, she does believe he has the potential for solid scholarly work.

When Jennifer first went to the Aging Center, she worked with another individual as a mentor.  That person left Duke and left behind a “rather disastrous situation” which significantly affected Jennifer and ended up putting her far behind in her work.  Dr. Kraus became her mentor at that point, and they have worked together on the genetics group and on research teams since then.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?\nDr. Kraus noted that someone in a research position needs to be able to ask pertinent questions, know the tools that are needed to help answer those questions, and be able to write up and present results in public.  He believes Jennifer has all of these abilities.  Additionally, her evolving area of expertise is unique and not being explored by anyone else.  This, he notes presents opportunities (e.g., having a “wide open” area to investigate) as well as challenges (e.g., finding resources and having to develop a vision of what needs to be done in the area).  Jennifer is great with seeking out resources and establishing networks/connections, so Dr. Krause has no doubt she would meet the challenges with great success.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.\nAs noted by Dr. Kraus, the areas in need of improvement for Jennifer are what one would expect from someone at her career stage.  As someone relatively new to the field, she will need to continue to develop increasing independence as a researcher and as someone who can negotiate her own partnerships.  He also  noted Jennifer’s limited publication record to date and ascribed that to the “disaster” of her first year in the Center.  He did say, however, that she has presented at national meetings in a most successful way, and she will have two seminal publications very shortly.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.\nJennifer is a very responsible individual who can be counted on to fulfill her commitments and do that in a timely way.  She has been able to balance many competing demands but will need continued mentoring to be able to continue to do that.  There is no question about her effectiveness in doing what is expected of her … and more.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).\nDr. Kraus said that Jennifer is an excellent member of the research team … making significant contributions, asking important questions, offering helpful perspectives, and so on.  “There are no red flags” in this area.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND (c) ADMINISTRATORS.\nDr. Kraus could not speak to Jennifer’s relationship with administrators or students, but she is a most effective colleague.  She is easy to work with, can be counted on to do her part, and helps others think through ideas that will allow them to pursue their own line of investigation.\n\nPLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK\nAll of these qualities are strengths of Jennifer.  Dr. Kraus noted no concerns or issues.\n\nWHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?\nHer work in the Center is ending, and she is looking to move into new roles.

We shared common interests regarding standards.  We worked out a research agenda together, published together, wrote grants together and are now co-editing a book on clinical research informatics.

She teaches the Pharm course, and I teach with her a bit.  Finally, I’ve been a research mentor for her to some extent.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?\nMary is enthusiastic (particularly related to research), an excellent teacher (especially regarding Pharm), and a well-respected clinician.

If I were forced to identify something, I would say that on occasion, she “forgets this or that” – primarily because she is carrying so many roles in several different institutions – but this has been only in relation to small things … nothing large or significant.  And it may be that I’m more of a perfectionist than I should be, thereby making me even aware of this.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.\nMary develops good relationships with students from all disciplines in our department and is able to explain things clearly so that they truly understand concepts.  She sets high standards for students and takes initiative (e.g., she started a journal club with CRNA students).  She provides good feedback to students that helps them create worthy products/projects, and she is highly respected by others.  Mary also is well networked regarding clinical practice and uses those networks to her students’ advantage.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).\nShe is enthusiastic, gets the job done, and learns quickly (e.g., how to write good test questions).

WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?\nThere have been many changes in leadership here at Wayne State, and things seem to be “bogged down” while the institution gets clear of its goals, including those related to research.  Mary has great potential for doing important research and wants to be in an institution where she can do that.  There also are financial problems in Michigan and while our department has been very successful in generating revenue, we often do not benefit from that, which can become quite frustrating after a while.

Being in a research intense institution will support her career trajectory. In Canada we are suffering for budgetary cuts and can’t offer faculty positions.\n\nShe brings nursing expertise, research expertise and her knowledge base is strong. She is a team payer energetic and can excite the people working with her\n\nOn her PhD work I was overwhelmed but I took her on because the dividends are huge and she will make a difference and this is what motivated to take her on.\n\nHer work with pain is very important.

I have also known Paula through another initiative … I am the co-PI on Canada’s strategic program related to pain, and Paula has been one of the trainees in that program; this was tied to her PhD work since the program is designed to build research capacity related to pain.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?\nPaula knows where pain research in children is at.  She has done both qualitative and quantitative research and is comfortable with both methods.  She has a clear program of research.  Her strong nursing background is evident as she works effectively with interdisciplinary groups and when it comes to being able to look at the whole picture regarding pain management.

They also collaborated to form a new organization, the International Family Nursing Association, and they are co-chairs to plan the 2013 conference for that association.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?\nDr. Knafl described Dr. Chesla as a premier researcher, having been the PI on at least 2 RO-1 grants and several non-NIH grants, and the co-PI on several other major studies. She can easily mentor PhD students and faculty regarding their research, and has received awards for mentorship.

They have not taught together or been on the same research study, but they have collaborated as colleagues in the department.  Dr. Lee commented, in particular, that Dr. Chesla was the department chair when a very difficult situation presented itself, and she noted how Dr. Chesla handled that situation directly and fairly.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?\nDr. Lee noted that Dr. Chesla is a valued member of the department whose work has been a significant factor in continuing the qualitative research work for which the school has been known for many years.  She wrote one of the earliest articles on triangulation (today referred to as mixed methods) and challenged the research community to consider the meaning when quantitative and qualitative findings are incongruent.

She is “not conflict-phobic” but will take on conflict and work collaboratively to resolve/manage it.  She has a reputation for being “tough” and has very high expectations of students, yet they all “flock to her” because they know they will learn so much from working with her.  She teaches both MSN and doctoral students and is a faculty member others will often go to for advice on how to deal with a student issue.

I then left to take a faculty position elsewhere and in 2003 came on the faculty at UCSF.  Kit was my assigned mentor, and she has remained a colleague and mentor since then.  We have taught the Intro to Qualitative Research course together, she has been a guest speaker in other courses I’ve taught, we are in the same department, and she is the co-PI on my R-01 grant.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S STRENGTHS RELATED TO THIS POSITION?\nKit is quite expert in her field, has great national and international influence as a scholar, and “knows how things work” in the research world (having been extensively funded herself and served on study panels).  She helped me and others be successful with grant writing and manuscript preparation/revision, and she is “savvy” regarding research.  She provides “unsparing critique” and excellent feedback, but is always positive in how it’s done.  Additionally, she willingly accepts critique from others and in that way serves as a good role model for junior scientists and even more accomplished colleagues.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS THE CANDIDATE’S WEAKNESSES RELATED TO THIS POSITION?  TELL ME AT LEAST ONE AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.\nI do not really see it as a weakness – in fact I see it as a strength – but some people do not appreciate her direct communication style.  She will not hold back if her opinion differs from others’ and she will say what’s on her mind if she believes it will lead to a better outcome.  She is never rude in how she does this, and the ultimate outcome is most often a better one after various perspectives have been explored.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S EFFECTIVENESS IN PERFORMING JOB RESPONSIBILITIES.\nShe works harder than almost anyone I know.  She fulfills responsibilities and makes time in her schedule to do what’s expected of her (e.g., she devotes the 10% or so she is funded on my grant to grant activities and does not “shirk” them).\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S INTERPERSONAL SKILLS (I.E., WHAT’S IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THIS PERSON?).\nKit is very personable, fun, and a good companion and colleague.  She brings a high commitment to the nursing profession and to family nursing –having been involved in starting a new organization with that focus and organizing/planning the first international conference it will sponsor soon – and holds high standards for herself and others.  She supports and encourages others in a natural, sincere kind of way, and she is easy to work with.\n\nDESCRIBE THE CANDIDATE’S ATTITUDE/RELATIONSHIP WITH (a) STUDENTS, (b) COLLEAGUES, AND © ADMINISTRATORS.\nKit has been a wonderful teaching colleague who is generous with and regularly gets very high marks from students.  She can convey difficult concepts in ways that students and colleagues understand, and she is effective as a lecturer, seminar facilitator, guest speaker, and professional conference presenter.  She is able to see where people are and help them know when they are ready for the next step (e.g., promotion, tenure), and is generous in praising others.  She works effectively with faculty and administrators here at UCSF.\n\nPLEASE COMMENT ON THE CANDIDATE’S  …  DEPENDABILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY  …  ABILITY TO TAKE AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS  …  ABILITY TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY  …  QUALITY OF WORK\nThere are no concerns in these areas.  Clearly she can and does work independently, and her work is of the highest quality – she would not be so successful of that were not true – but she also is able to be a team member who allows others to take the lead.  She extends herself to our research team when we need to struggle with difficult issues and is willing to take on her share of the work.\n\nWHY DID THIS CANDIDATE LEAVE HER/HIS POSITION IN YOUR ORGANIZATION?  WOULD YOU RE-HIRE HER/HIM?\nWe will miss Kit terribly, but I understand her desire – at this point in her career – to move to a new environment that will offer new opportunities for growth, new networks, more “freedom” (i.e., in a private school), and more resources.  She has always worked quite effectively with Cathy Gilliss, and I know she is looking forward to that relationship.\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO OFFER REGARDING THE CANDIDATE’S EMPLOYMENT OR JOB PERFORMANCE?\nOnly that we surely will miss her in so many ways.  She truly has helped our department and our school be stronger.  Our loss is surely Duke’s gain."},{"RefCheckID":"300","CandID":"403","RefCheckInitials":"TDW","ReferenceName":"Ira Cheifetz, MD","DateOfCheck":"2012-11-20T00:00:00","ReferenceText":"REFERENCE CHECK FORM\nA.\tNature of relationship between reference and candidate\nSupervising physician for her pediatric nurse practitioner practice\nB.\tDescribe candidate’s strengths related to position description \nThorough, dedicated looks out for patient’s interest.

Dr. Mayer is a tenured Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, currently being reviewed for Full Professor. She has 77 peer review publications, 3 monographs, 1 book, and 10 book chapter. She has numerous poster and podium presentations. With respect to research funding, she lists 14 sources of research funding, of which after obtaining her Ph.D., is PI on four – note this not include her being PI on the P50, where she is site PI. Among these, one is from NIH/NCI, the remaining are from Centers or Disease Prevention and Control, South Atlantic American Cancer Society, and one from UNC. Three grants are pending.  \n\n2.\tFocused program of research.  Her research focus is on cancer survivorship issues, such as addressing the needs of survivors as they transition from care to longer term survivorship. This includes providing them access to information via eHealth interventions. \n\n3.\tTeaching experience congruent with position’s needs.  She has taught several courses related to oncology nursing (e.g., advanced concepts in oncology nursing, advanced pharmacology in oncology nursing, cancer survivorship, etc.), applications of ehealth, primary care management of adults, and management of complex health problem in adults. She has chaired one dissertation committee and has served on six; she also has chaired 10 thesis/Masters projects, and was a member of three. She has worked with six postdoctoral fellows. Overall, her teaching evaluations are consistently between 4.5 to 5.0 on a five point scale, as self-reported in her “Essay for Promotion to Professor” (see p.4). \n\n4.\tRelevance and extent of clinical practice:   In the 80s and 90s, Dr. Mayer served as an oncology nurse specialist, staff nurse, nurse manager, chemotherapy nurse/nurse practitioner, and staff nurse. From 2000 to early 2003, she served as Chief Medical Offer for what appears to be a health service media company. She currently serves as a nurse practitioner in medical oncology in the Breast Program at the UNC Cancer Hospital while also serving on the steering committee on the UNC Lineberger Oncology Advanced Practice Providers.      \n\n5.\tService to the profession.  She is currently a member on eight professional organizations (e.g., American Academy of Nursing) and is or has served in numerous capacities to the Oncology Nursing Society, ONS foundation, NCI, ACS, and Southeastern Cancer Study Group – she has been on several advisory boards. Dr. Mayer has served or is serving as a journal reviewer, and is currently the Editor to the Clinical Journal of Oncology, Nursing. She has served as a grant reviewer (e.g., ONS). She currently serves on several committees at UNC (e.g., Faculty Counsel, UNC Survivorship Program Steering Committee) at the School the School of Nursing (e.g., Search Committee).  \n\n6.\tJob stability:  From 2007 until present she has been at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and prior to then, four years at Tufts University. Overall, she has had job stability.\n\n7.\tAreas of potential contribution/match to DUSON.  Dr. Mayer can help substantially with teaching and clinical supervision of oncology nursing. She can also teach courses in informatics (e.g. , ehealth) and adult health. She has experiencing supervising Ph.D. students and chairing dissertation committees. \n\nReviewer’s Recommendation:  \nDr.  Mayer has a strong publication record, it well recognized and respected, has mentored several students, appears to be an excellent instructor, and has contributed significantly to the field of oncology nursing in various capacities. If there are any concerns, it is that she has not obtained much external funding as a PI, especially in regards to NIH support. If a criterion to hire a senior level person is transferring established research funding, then this person does not qualify. However, given DUSON’s efforts to secure a senior level person in the area of oncology, the question is whether the Administration is willing to forego the above concern and interview her, given that she would like be competitive being promoted to Full Professor. I would suggest a follow-up phone interview based on the strong need to hire a more senior level person in oncology nursing."},{"RefCheckID":"327","CandID":"469","RefCheckInitials":"IL","ReferenceName":"Mary Palmer","DateOfCheck":"2013-10-11T00:00:00","ReferenceText":"CONFIDENTIAL \n\nFACULTY CANDIDATE REFERENCE CHECKLIST\n\nApplicant:  Dr.  Jennie DeGagne\t\t\t\t\tPosition:  Pop Health Care Coord. \n\nReference Name:   Dr. Mary Palmer, Professor, UNC School of Nursing. \n\nA.\tNature of relationship between reference and candidate.

Her project entitled Adherence to Antiemetic Guidelines in Malignant Gliomas was an exemplary project conducted at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University.\n\nIn many ways Mary Lou Affronti has been a model DNP student. She entered the program with a clear understanding of how a DNP education could both contribute to her own professional growth and benefit her institution.  On admission, she had identified a project and continued with that same project throughout her studies.  She worked with an interdisciplinary team to assess barriers and facilitators to practice change and implement her project.  She was a true champion of ordering appropriate antiemetic medications for individuals with brain tumors who are receiving chemotherapy.  This is a vulnerable population who are often not able to advocate for their own supportive care.   During her proposal defense, I heard several individuals say “paying attention to supportive care measures is key to helping our patients tolerate treatments”.  \n\nThe implementation of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Antiemetic Guidelines was in response to a patient care need.  Mary Lou Affronti took a multifaceted approach to this practice change.  She included a provider education session, implementation of risk assessment tool with computerized standardized antiemetic guideline order-sets, and a monthly audit-feedback strategy.  A particular strength of this capstone project was that it incorporated a patient outcome measures.  She was able to demonstrate that adherence to antiemetic guidelines resulted in effective nausea/vomiting control in the patient population.  While the oncology community has been strong is evaluating data and outlining guidelines for care, often these guidelines are not readily adopted.  Ms. Affront’s project and article provide a blueprint for how to implement guidelines for cancer care at Duke and other cancer centers across the nation. \n\nMs. Affronit is an independent self-directed to learner who set her own goals and deadlines and then stuck to them.  It has been an honor to work with such and outstanding student. Attached please find a letter of support from Dr. Katy Peters a physician at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke University and a copy of the manuscript entitled Adherence to Antiemetic Guidelines in Patients with Malignant Glioma: Translating Evidence into Practice that was submitted April 12, 2013 for publication to the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  This is a high impact journal for an interdisciplinary oncology audience.  Dr. Henry Friedman, one of her committee members was so impressed with her capstone defense presentation that he highly encouraged her to submit to this journal.  \n\nThank you for your consideration, \n\n\nSusan M.

Additionally, when I spoke with this candidate about EBP, all she could talk about was using evidence to underlie her own clinical practice as an RN.  When I asked about implementation science, she really did not seem to know what I was talking about and kept talking about doing research.  Additionally, she asked many questions about the DNP program, almost as if she knew nothing about that kind of program.  To be honest, she sounded delightful, she seems to be quite exceptional as a researcher, and her references were extremely supportive  …  but I did not get the sense that she has the experience, understanding or leadership in EBP/implementation science to meet the qualifications we posted.

She is a very experienced FNP and clinician and has 3-4 semesters of good clinical and classroom (MSN) teaching at UNC-CH.  She has taken a couple of courses in Nursing Education as a DNP student at Vanderbilt.   She has no scholarship.  She seemed fairly certain that she would be finished her DNP by August 2012 but \"not totally certain\".   She seemed more passionate about pediatric end of the FNP continuum.\nShe was well spoken and passionate about FNP education, but her CV and her productivity are just mediocre. \n\nSee detailed comments in the data base."},{"noteID":"771","CandID":"385","noteDate":"2012-04-23T00:00:00","note":"Based on reveiwers comments, committee agreed candidate to receive regret ltr; ltr sent 4/27/12"},{"noteID":"772","CandID":"342","note":"Materials forwarded to Parker Executive Search"},{"noteID":"773","CandID":"393","noteDate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00","note":"The committee recommended candidate receive a regret ltr; ltr sent 5/17/12"},{"noteID":"774","CandID":"350","noteDate":"2012-05-17T00:00:00","note":"Per CLG email of 5/17/2012, candidate to receive regret ltr (offer ltr sent to another candidate LAS)"},{"noteID":"775","CandID":"392","noteDate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00","note":"Based on reviewers comments and committee's discussion, candidate to receive regret ltr; ltr sent 5/17/12"},{"noteID":"776","CandID":"304","noteDate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00","note":"Committee suggested candidate receive a regret ltr; ltr sent 5/18/12"},{"noteID":"777","CandID":"227","noteDate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00","note":"Candidate was to complete doctoral studies in May 2011 and  to advise committee once defense date had been set; no communication from candidate since that time; the committee now recommends ltr be sent to candidate that her file will be closed; ltr sent 5/18/2012"},{"noteID":"778","CandID":"395","noteDate":"2012-06-04T00:00:00","note":"candidate is in Japan until August; committee recommended Skype session ADRA, search committee and statistician faculty."},{"noteID":"779","CandID":"401","noteDate":"2012-07-02T00:00:00","note":"committee recommends regret ltr - not a competitive candidate for stats position"},{"noteID":"780","CandID":"396","noteDate":"2012-07-02T00:00:00","note":"search committee asked CMJ and RR to review and rank candidate; CEB to do phone screen"},{"noteID":"781","CandID":"397","noteDate":"2012-07-02T00:00:00","note":"Search committee requested CMJ and RR to review and rank candidate; TW to do phone screen"},{"noteID":"782","CandID":"399","noteDate":"2012-07-02T00:00:00","note":"Search committee requested CMJ and RR to review candidate's CV"},{"noteID":"783","CandID":"356","noteDate":"2012-07-18T00:00:00","note":"Per dean's email, candidate has decided not to pursue offer."},{"noteID":"784","CandID":"390","noteDate":"2012-06-25T00:00:00","note":"Committee recommended candidate receive ltr advised position has been filled); ltrs sent 7/2/12"},{"noteID":"785","CandID":"394","noteDate":"2012-06-25T00:00:00","note":"committee recommended ltr advising position has been filled; ltr sent 7/2/12"},{"noteID":"786","CandID":"342","note":"Candidate accepted another position"},{"noteID":"787","CandID":"408","noteDate":"2012-08-13T00:00:00","note":"After discussion, committee recommended regret ltr (no scholarly productivity beyond teaching expereince; 8/20 SLD share additional information re:  candidate and committee agreed to do a phone screen.

Her record of providing statistical consultation to faculty, serving as the statistical co-investigator on faculty grants, and mentoring others is outstanding.   She has a realistic understanding of the needs of the School of Nursing and is excited about the possibility of joining the DUSON community.  Her connections within DCRI are strong, and she is interested in building stronger ties between DCRI and DUSON, perhaps through a fellowship program or joint research grant endeavors.  She has two concerns, both of which are reasonable.  First that she be given some time for her own research work  -- note she has one grant currently submitted as PI (r-hCuZnSOD for Preventing Chronic Respiratory Morbidity in Premature Infants); and second that we are clear on what her appointment in the SON as an Associate Research Professor would entail.

At one point during the conversation, the candidate talked about the minimal resources available in gerontology and the excessive workloads expected of faculty her at DUSON.  When asked to clarify this statement, she clarified her statement stating that \"everyone seems so busy and those with gerontology experience already have a full plate.\"  Based on her CV, the candidate has limited experience in obtaining extramural funding. Most of the extramural funding she has listd on her CV have her as a research assistant.  Finally, when I asked her about why she is interested in leaving the Univ of Iowa where she is an associate professor with tenure and coming to DUSON, she could not articulate the 2-3 things that attracted her to Duke.  She only stated that Dr. Hewitt at the UWI encouraged her to apply for this position. The candidate's scholarly presentation was very difficult to follow and fragmented.

I also found her to have an aura of arrogance, which was not appealing in this context.  She does seem to have a lot of expertise in public health nursing, is fairly well-published, lots of teaching experience and appears well connected.

He wants to come in as a tenured assoc. prof., but in the list of \"Refereed Papers\" 20 of what are listed as papers are actually conference proceedings, so it appears that he is including podium presentations as refereed papers, which is incorrect.  Out of 48 \"refereed papers,\" 20 are conference proceedings.  Therefore he comes nowhere near meeting the criteria for assoc. prof with tenure.  He has had very little R level funding given the length of his career. He was unsure of where his primary appt. would be, but assured us he would be \"disruptive as hell.\"  He also said he is interested in doing \"as little as I can get away with.\"  While he may have been kidding about these 2 comments, they are not appropriate in a job interview in which you do not know anyone.

In general, I felt that Dr Ward was very pleasant, clearly has a good rapport with her current students, and is dedicated to nursing.

I would imagine that she is okay in the classroom but I also wonder if she would be on par with other doctorally prepared faculty and even with our ABSN students? She just does not resonate as someone that would \"fit\" with our academic culture. It is concerning to see on her resume the associations with NC Central since tha program has had marginal performance over the years and she lists herself as a consultant. She has many things on her resume (presentations) that were at her church or with her employer. I guess it makes me question her overall professional development.   She also has very few publications and indicated in at least one conversation that she does not desire to be on the tenure track here due to not wanting to work at that level.

I appreciate being given the opportunity to hear her presentation and to meet with her in a small group format. However, I am of the opinion that Dr. Ward would not be a good addition to the DUSON faculty at any level or in any role. Her CV suggests a lack of significant experience of the caliber expected of Du ke faculty. Her only teaching experience has been in a diploma program, except for some remidiation work related to NCLEX review/preperation.She has one publication, 2 pages in length, although she indicates that her dissertation work is in progress. She has a very limited number of presentations of national or even statewide significance. More than half of the presentations she has listed have either been made at churches or her places of employment, while both are important venues they suggest a lack of significant professional development or comittment one would expect of a Duke faculty. While such a significant lack of professional or scholarly contributions could be overlooked in a less seasoned educator, I would expect more from a person at Dr. Ward's point in career development. In meeting with her after her presentation I found it concerning that she is interested in a clinical track position because she \"has a lot going on in (her) life and does not want to have to worry about funding and publications\". That statement, matched with a  CV rather weak in professional substance, causes me to wonder what level of contribution this candidate will make at Duke. While I enjoyed Dr. Ward's presentation I found that it lacked the intellectual sophistcation or intrigue one might expect from a faculty member at Duke. I left feeling that her understanding of her subject matter and methodology were rather basic for a doctorally prepared academician and that the dissertation had been more driven by process and necessity than by a spirit of intellectual inquiry. There was no \"wow factor\" to the presentation nor could I find much value in her studies results or her explanation of how they might inform practice or education. \nI know that we are facing a serious and pressing need for additional ABSN faculty, however I hope that we will not allow that to influence hiring decisions when a candidate is not adequately prepared or qualified to be on faculty at Duke. Our students expect and deserve faculty who, in addition to having doctoral education,  have made some level of significant contributions to our profession through both scholarship and leadership. Despite the fact that Dr. Ward appears to be a lovely woman, I have significant concerns about her ability to make more than mediocre academic and intellectual contributions here at Duke. I have concerns that she may not be academically or intellectually on par with our students, and most of the faculty at DUSON or Duke.  I am hopeful that we will continue to look for faculty who can not only foster the intellectual development of our students but also make significant scholarly contributions toward the enhancement of DUSON's reputation as a leading academic institution.   To that end we need  faculty, who like our students, are exceptional rather than mediocre or average.

She has a good track record of team publications, obvious team collagboration in practice settings and has experience as a teacher (adjunct fauclty).  I would recommend hiring her or at least a second interview. I am sorry there was not an opportunity for the peds faculty to meet with her to see how she would fit in with our teaching, research and service misson.  Did she think it was odd not to meet with peds faculty?  I hope she did not think we were being rude. Perhaps she can meet with us when/if she is brought back for a second round interview. Because of ther strong practice base she would be a nice addition to the DNP faculty (capstone and N651) or to the MSN faculty (peds courses)."},{"evalNum":"92","CandID":"88","DateOfVisit":"2009-09-10T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Academic/Admin Team","qualitative":"Dear Search Committee:  After thinking about both candidates I am struck by the questions of \n1.

She has been on the edge of cutting edge research and genetics in the care of children with cancer. Not only could she teach pediatrics, but with the anticipation of the new ABSN curriculum redevelopment she has knowledge that could be applied in adult health, foundations, pathophysiology and certainly pediatrics. Should she be offered the position she would balance out the ABSN faculty by being another strong researcher to join Relf, Brion & Bailey…and to balance out Martin, Gordon, Phillips, Turner. I think we not only need this depth and breath…but her enthusiasm and professional credentials.  I quite enjoyed my time with her during the presentation, 1:1, ABSN faculty time and dinner. I see her being a very ++ addition to DUSON and to the ABSN core group. \n     Where she is going to need some effort is to reaquaint herself with the role/skills of the bedside nurse and the issues in pediatrics. It is important that she not teach the peds material from the platform of an advanced practice nurse, but rather from the generalist perspective. She has been out of nursing education for some time so if hired, orientation needs to include time in the hospital shadowing peds nurses as well as time in classroom instruction for large groups of students. I think she is quite up to the challenge and would do a fine job with our students as she is accomplished, seasoned and an expert in her field. I am especially encouraged by what she would bring to our students as it relates to her firm grounding in genetics and genomics. I would welcome her as a colleague and hope the committee and the Dean will giver her a serious evaluation for the ABSN position. I very much can see her here. I strongly support her hire.\n***As a side note, I think in time she would also have cross-over with the DNP program and the peds acute care NP program. I know this is not what she is being hired for…and due to her extensive background she would provide us with many options to use her knowledge and skills in cancer and pediatrics, perhaps allowing us to develop a program in post-graduate genetics for niurses or attract doctoral and DNP students with genetics interests.….as has been said, she would give us \"depth to the bench!\""},{"evalNum":"96","CandID":"88","DateOfVisit":"2009-09-10T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"DUSON Faculty","qualitative":"I really liked this candidate.

She also asked about possibilities in other programs (in the semester the peds course wasn't offered in the ABSN program).  I think she could bring real strength to the DNP program (and we need more faculty here) as well as to the ACPNP program.  She had real ideas about a research program that is important -- and could be conducted at Duke.  I don't often get excited about a candidate -- but  I found Dr. Wise exciting.

She is not only a terrific candidate for the ABSN position, but she will also fit in very well across many programs such as the peds acute care program (which has a lot of room for growth) and the DNP program.  This pediatric candidate is very special because she has experience caring for children across the pediatric life-span.  We have several peds faculty that are neonatal experts. We have fewer peds faculty that have expericence (teaching and research), across the the pediatric life-span.

While I appreciate that the current need is for a pediatric ABSN faculty member, it has been the philosophy of DUSON that faculty teach across programs and we teach clinical content in each other's courses.

She seemed more eager to move away from her current work than entranced with becoming an academic; however, she has demonstrated scholarly abilities in participating in research and writing that would serve her well as a new regular rank faculty.  I believe the change to a general pediatrics focus in the ABSN program would be a significant change for her, and while there certainly would be opportunities for her to pursue her clinical research interests, from the ABSN position perspective the majority of her work would be in community and general pediatrics.  While her presentation style could be enhanced, it was a topic of importance and she demonstrated some core pedagogical skills related to developing interest, logical flow, etc.  She did however try to cover way too much information in too much detail and that detracted from the session.  Dr. Wise's background in oncology would be of value to the school as would her PNP credential and experience, which if capacity were needed could be of value in the MSN and potentially DNP programs. And if she has true interest in returning to an expanded pedi focus, I think she could be a successful new faculty.

From \"trashing\" her interium dean, the University of Texas School of Nursing, her colleagues at UT, the \"toxic\" enviornment in which she works to the voluminious amounts of comments regarding her personal life: her \"disappointing\" 19 year old son who married a woman in Nevada and only spent 6 days with this woman, to her primary dysfunctional family of orgin (chemical dependency) to comments about her insulin pump, her gastric band, etc., etc. I think something is terribly wrong and \"off\"  with Dr. Dormire's motivations for wanting to leave UT….and I think from spending and observing her in 4 different venues during her interview time that her motivations are to leave UT, end of story. Where she goes and what she does, I am venturing are of little importance to her. Duke would represent a possible vehicle to achieve her primary goal: that of leaving UT. It should be noted that Dr. Dormier has an odd career trajectory (Staff Nurse Position in 2005) while at UT (which she said was done for \"financial reasons\"). Additionally, it would seem that either her research is over…or she has lost interest in her current topic…as her funding is spent and her plans for additional funding are sketchy at best. She is bringing no research dollars with her. She also mentioned that she is tenured at UT, but her resume does not indicate that….and that she would expect to come here tenured was inappropriate to be discussed in the interview situations in which I observed her. She seemed much more interested in how much money she would be making, where she could do her work (home vs office) than she was in the worklife at DUSON, the kinds of students we have in this program or how we all work together? It seemed most of the interview was solely about her and her wants/needs. To say this interview experience was \"odd\" would be an understatement!  I do not doubt that she has a love of teaching….but her current experience has been at the master's and doctoral level. It did not seem upon questioning that her that her interest was with our population of students…but rather this position would be a way for her to remove herself from her \"toxic\" enviornment. If it were not bad enough how she conducted herself on this interview what was even more concerning is that she seemed to have no awareness regarding how inappropriate it was to be talking about her previous employer and all the highly personal information that she shared to anyone who would listen! Dr. Dormier is extremely out of touch. I felt she left this experience thinking that she would be offered the position and this interview went well. I have never seen a person do so much talking…and so little listening. In many ways, she is a very sad woman. \nThere is no question in my mind that she is not a fit at all for DUSON. I would be embarassed to have her as a colleague and I can't see how she would make a contribution to our program….as her motives for coming are not in sync with our needs.  I would be afraid her unprofessional behavior, her totally unaware manners would poorly reflect on DUSON.

I attended the presentation, lunch and a very short meeting with the pediatric faculty. Dr. Caines read a script during the presentation rather than speaking from her slides. She explained that she did not want to forget anything so she would be reading from a script--just as a podium presenter might do. This was distracting and was not well suited to a small room with just several attendees. The presentation was much too long for the time allotted so Dr. Caines skipped over sections in order to be able to complete it. I am concerned that this may be an example of her teaching style. I suggest that the committee gather more evidence about her teaching effectiveness.  The meeting with the pediatric faculty raised more questions than answers for me. There was not enough time allotted to assess Dr. Caines' knowledge about pediatric content. When asked about how current she is with inpatient pediatrics, Dr. Caines explained that she has had little inpatient pediatric clinical experience. She said that she worked in obstetrics for 2 years and had experience with newborns. Currently, she is working in two school based health clinics. Dr. Caines stated that she keeps up to date on pediatric issues by going to weekly grand rounds. She explained that the didactic and the clinical pieces of the undergraduate pediatric course she is teaching are separate. The pediatric faculty asked Dr. Caines to clarify her PNP certification because we did not recognize the name of the certification board on her CV. Dr. Caines incorrectly identified the board on her CV as the \"Certification Board of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners\". The name of the board at the time of her certification was the \"National Board of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners and Associates\". The board changed its name and is now the Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (2005). As for professional organizations, Dr. Caines explained that she belonged to the Society of Adolescent Medicine rather than NAPNAP or AFPNP because it better fits her interest area. Another concern is that Dr. Caines lists a number of published abstracts as \"publications\" on her CV and 2 1/2 pages of her CV contain professional development meetings she attended. My greatest concern relates to information that I discovered when \"googling\" Dr. Caines because I didn't recognize her name. The first and second weblinks that I found were her ratings from USM and URI on www.ratemyprofessor.com. The ratings were simply awful and the comments were very concerning (e.g., weak knowledgebase, disrespectful to students, condescending, psychologically damaging, inflexible). Perhaps the evaluations do not truly reflect her teaching effectiveness. I hope that the committee will do some due diligence in sorting this out should the candidate be seriously considered.

I believe she would infuse the academic environment at DUSON with some new and novel approaches to educating the ABSN student. In conversation and through her research presentation, Dr. Caines was able to demonstrate a level of intellectual curiosity that will undoubtedly motivate her to advance her research and make significant contributions to nursing science in the areas of pediatrics and public health/health promotion. Her experience with several highly regarded nursing programs, her obvious intelligence and her desire to engage in a program of interdisciplinary research are strengths that would enhance not only the ABSN program but also DUSON and Duke University. In addition to her valuable clinicical, research and educational skill set, Dr. Caines appears to be a genuinely nice person who appeared comfortable with both small group interaction and a larger, more formal presentation setting.

She has not coordinated CIs in the recent past (once at a former position).  She will need some guidance from Duke faculty. My only other concern would be her integration with other programs besides strictly ABSN. She did not have a recent grasp of the current issues facing PNPs and is NOT a member of the PNP organization, NAPNAP since she is a PNP. We asked her about this and she said it was financial.  It just seemed a bit odd since she is very interested in adolescents and NAPNAP has a lot of support for practitioners invovled with adolscents and generates much of the science on this population. She also incorrectly listed her certification organization on her CV - she erroneously wrote the certification body name.  Sharron asked her about this and she did not realize the name was wrong. Hopefully this was an oversite - however, I would think it would be good for us to verify she indeed has a current certification through the PNCB (Pediatric Nursing Certification Board) either by asking her to provide a current copy of her card or we can verify online for $30.  I called the PNCB today to ask them and they told me to go about it above. Overall, I think she is a strong candidate for the ABSN position and for the school.

I did not hear from her when she will be finished with her MPH…and I do think some possible overlap may exist between what she sees as our community course and what she may have been teaching as a health promotion/disease prevention course. These areas seem to me to be very easy to clear up with the articulation of program and course objectives. I think it will be very important if steps are taken to move forward with her hire that she first understand her priority is teaching in the ABSN Program. She articulated several times about Duke being a \"candy store\" of opportunities…and I think without focus both Kay and some of her colleagues (Global Health) could fragment her focus. The need is clear in the ABSN Program and it is important that she understand first that she is coming to fill that need, if in fact, that is the job?   While her presentation seemed very circular and at times not focused, it did provide a sense of her expertise and her presentation style. I think students will find her both approachable and able to provide the expertise that is needed in this content area.\nIt is important to note if steps go forward that she did express concern at several points in the visit about the community course moving from a 3 semester sequence to a one semester course. Reassurance was given regarding threading the material through courses….while I do not sense this is a \"deal breaker\" for her, she brought it up several times (maybe just to confirm the position???). But worth noting.\nI found her to be genuine and very interested in the program.

Not only was her affect flat, or below flat (and I do not think it had anything to do with her late flight arrival), she is NO MATCH for the needs of the ABSN program. She would be totally out of sync with the other faculty and esp. with the faculty with whom she would be teaching the most: Helen Gordon. Dr. Pritham demonstrated good technical understanding of women's health content but her examples of delivery demonstrated no creativty and little application to the needs of students. It was concerning that early in her visit when ask \"why Duke, why now in your career?\" Her response was that she \"wanted less contact with students and more time for her research.\" It demonstrated to me that she had not read the job description and was not sophisticated enough to understand the issues with meeting Duke's needs before her own.   \nI was very concerned after her presentation. She presented old statistics, spend 40 minutes providing her audience with the background of her study (some of which was not about maternal addiction) and then spent less than 10 minutes on her results. After seeing her \"matched cohort\" study…I could see why she only spent 10 minutes on her results…one group had 138 subjects, the other 16. Hardly a \"matched\" sample! Perhaps she underestimates the level of research we are use to hearing about? But as bad was her presentation style: heavy text powerpoint, flat affect delivery, no excitement about her content, she laid her remote down with each slide which made for a constant motion in her presentation that was distracting. It was so poorly done…and I thought if this in any way is an example of how she presents to students, she would lose our bright students in the first 5 minutes. I think as an ABSN faculty we are working hard to improve the scholarship of teaching at Duke. To add a member to our faculty who so clearly is not interested nor probably capable of pushing her teaching skills, would be a big mistake. As one of the people who would be her immediate faculty colleague, I felt no synergy, no connection with this woman like I did with Dr. Karen Caines and Kay who was in 2 weeks ago. This woman DOES NOT FIT. She is not of the caliber that mirrors other faculty capabilities at Duke. She mentioned several examples of what she truly believed was innovation in teaching, things like: streaming videos into Blackboard, using CD roms from the textbook, developing study guides to \"send students to the simulation lab.\" She actually is so out of touch she thought this was INNOVATION! When ask how she decides what content to include in a course she says, \"Oh, I have moved content around over the years, but now I just follow the textbook!\" \nI rather imagine for the university that she teaches in, that she may \"stand out\" as a very committed teacher who works very hard. Her described teaching load is horrific…and I do not doubt that she wants to pursue her research and relieve herself of some of the mundane tasks she is responsible for (site procurement, student immunizations, CI training, etc). There might have been a time in the evolution of the ABSN Program that her skills and approach might have been a match? But unfortunately for her, we have evolved over the last four years to a level that her deficiencies and her traditional approach of teaching would be glaring. She said many times over the course of the various venues that \"I just do not feel I have done my job if I do not give students everything I can give them.\" This was described as a very \"additive\" approach…with little discrimination from her on what is relevent and salient. Not at all the way we approach content in courses now…and teaching accelerated students (of which she has no experience).  \nWe do not have to take just anybody. We can wait and keep looking for the caliber of person who will bring us something special and unique to add to this mix of faculty that are here and who have been hired. Someone who has developed a level of creativity and innovation in their teaching that our faculty will be energized and our students enriched. \nWe have the time to wait and search for a top-notch candidate. Dr. Pritham, is not the one.  I cannot see her at Duke and would not be happy, in fact, I would be very upset if she were added to the faculty mix, in particular to the ABSN Program. She would add a great deal of controversary to our group and in many ways she could \"drag down\" the progress that has been made, both the interpersonal balance we have achieved in the last 1.5 years as well as setting back the progress made in the scholarship of teaching.   I do not support her hire."},{"evalNum":"179","CandID":"138","DateOfVisit":"2010-02-16T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Others","qualitative":"Very personable, clearly dedicated to improving women's health with a particular focus on perinatal health for both women and their offspring"},{"evalNum":"180","CandID":"138","DateOfVisit":"2010-02-16T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"DUSON Faculty","qualitative":"Not particularly strong in presentation.

The SON needs to come to grips with the fact that CITDL reports to the business office, the Educational Institute is hanging out there -- and then we would have yet another Center.  The structure is absolutely ineffective.  Lots of activity -- not coordinated -- looks good -- Rome burns.   If we bring on this Center -- with a director that has no real authority over the technological resources of the SON or of the \"educational institute\" -- well we will have little impact on the productivity of faculty in delivering the best online education, or employing any set of innovative tools, or of integrated pedological technology.  Will we have another stand alone Center that does some stuff that most faculty don't know about or engage in.  The Director may do quite well personally -- reaching out to the university or nationally -- but he/she won't impact the productivity or excellence of the SON in meeting its strategic plan in leading in educational technology.  Might look good -- but not make a significant contribution in terms of what we do or deliver.  I thought Dr. Lombardi was quite good.  I would hire her.  I do think this is more of a staff position than a faculty position.  However, if we offer her a faculty position -- the clinical track is most appropriate, and she may be at the level of associate clinical professor -- although we would need a cv rather than a business resume to make that decision.  No doubt structure is not a search committee issue -- but I hope that somehow -- this issue is looked at.

Her published work is comprehensive and has the breadth that I think we would expect from someone with her connections.  With the credibility that she has earned from her work in the field, I was disappointed that I did not see examples of where Dr. Lombardi demonstrated the ability to move theory into practice.  I may have missed it or she may have had more fruitful conversations with other interviewers, but I was hoping to see instances where she had come into an institution as an observer or consultant, then put into place something that would demonstrate the long-term effectiveness of her ideas.  From my brief interview with her, as well as what I learned from her on-site lecture, I saw some interesting and thought-provoking ideas, but I didn't see where she had actually used them in any practical applications.  In my opinion, this isn't a show-stopper, but something we need to keep in mind as she begins working with us.  \nI think we could learn a lot from Dr. Lombardi.

It is not clear that she has any formal preparation in education principles and methods.

We took this second cohort with the commitment to have additional faculty to help carry the load and so this hire would not help in that way at all.

I like that she is younger….will be a perfect role model for the ABSN students, as many of them desire to go on for practice and research doctorates. I think it very wise that we bring on faculty who are younger….as someone needs to be concerned that we are going to look around and all the 50+ age faculty are going to exit at the same time?  This candidate presents herself in a very confident manner…and I am expecting will be very good, very student-centered in her teaching style.   That said, here is my concern. This candidate, like the previous 4 who have interviewed now have a distinct \"pattern\" to the interview…when ask \"why Duke?\" they all say the same thing….\"ability to do or get back to my research.\" Nothing wrong with research at a research intensive university….but hey, have they not read the job description??? Or are they getting guided into another position after they enter our doors? If so, let us know, so those of us who think we are getting a colleague to help us teach in the ABSN program can come to understand that our load is not going to be lightened at all. The job (I thought) Dr. Dekker is interviewing for is TEACHING and I hope teaching full-time? Because those of us who are teaching full-time and are on the clinical track and \"in the trenches\" with this second cohort are going to look around and find the faculty that were hired (Caines for one) are going to be doing research (because if they declare they are on the tenure track they get a diminished teaching load) and we are going to be holding this BIG teaching responsibility, by ourselves (Ward was a definite exception…clearly she is going to teach). So, instead of hiring 5 new faculty, we may only net 2.5…..it is going to look like we have all this new faculty…but that will not be the case.   I am thinking that something is occuring as they enter the interview process that has them \"shift\" their focus from the job description and place it on their research? This has now happened too many times to be just a \"fluke?\" I understand the importance of reseach….but tuition dollars also pay the bills here…and those of us \"carrying\" this load, what some helpers! I am still a bit stunned that Karen Caines has demonstrated already her intent to get back to her research and \"get her papers out.\" Far more was said about research in her recent visit, than her concern for the summer courses. I for one, on the \"quasi-clinical track\" am promoted on writing papers, too. But who can get to it?  Who can get to innovation….because it is looking like we are not hiring \"teaching colleagues\" but rather researchers who will occassionally teach a course.   I think this woman would be perfect for Duke. Just not in the ABSN Program. She wants to do research.

Grantsmanship is hard to evaluate: I am surprised that she has not garnered NIH funding of any kind, given her mentors and the type of research she's doing.

She has strong interests in nursing informatics, particularly relating to ontologies and in support of consumers. She is interested in genetics, decision support, and family health history.  I think these areas would fit in and contribute to work at Duke.  I am impressed with her productivity in 2009.

Although she has limited experience in writing grants, she does have the one award and states she has work with Dr. Brennan in grant writing. She is interested in teaching and research.  I think Dr. Peace has excellent potential.  I do think she needs to understand what she wants to do and what in what areas she wants to focus.

Her areas of research are very important and very interesting, yet she didn't convey the idea that she could lead a scientific investigation, nor that she had good command of the methods she had used.

In the field of obstetrics/maternity this is a very \"hot\" topic as it ties so closely to costs of birth in the U.S. and potential cost savings. I suspect it is only going to get more attention as healthcare economics becomes more important…and for that reason I would imagine that she will have several funding avenues available to her.  I suspect that there are many areas of collaboration in which she could make linkeges both on the Duke campus as well as across the U.S. Dr. Lippert at Duke was quite excited about the opportunities Dr. Bell would open up for Duke. I also recognize that having a PhD in maternity would position DUSON to attract PhD & DNP students that want to pursue projects and research in the maternity field….this would indeed expand our capacities…an expansion I would welcome.  I do not question the value of her mentors nor her research abilities. However, she is not a match on many other levels (per the posted job description) for this position. While she was very upfront with her intentions, she clearly stated that she will be commuting back and forth with her husband in Chicago (who has 4 years before retirement). They will share this task. While that is really not the primary concern her lack of understanding about the time and effort it will take to both establish her research plan, secure funding and LEARN TO TEACH is totally unrealistic. Unlike Karen Caines who will also be on the tenure track, this woman has NO TEACHING experience (by her own self-assessment). Karen Caines, does. While Dr. Bell is \"very willing to learn…and is a blank slate, so you will not have to undo old/bad habits, I have no classroom experience with a full semester course.\" She went on to add that she has no curriculum experience, no experience in the area of evaluating the clinical performance of pre-liscensure students (any students for that matter) and while she had an \"opportunity to take a 3 course sequence on teaching/learning in her PhD program, she did not take it.\" So, she also lacks any kind of a theoritical framework for teaching/learning. While her midwifery experience is good, though not recent, she did not seem to understand that this experience as an advanced practice nurse will not be the place from which she can teach to generalist, pre-liscensure nursing students. It is important to note that it has been 14 years since her in-patient experience in an acute care setting.   Her coming with no teaching experience against the backdrop of the very changed  \"landscape\" of the ABSN Program (2 cohorts) and a curriculum change pending,  prohibits the intense mentoring, guiding and teaching that this woman needs even to be up to \"minimum\" speed in this program. She will have to assume her load for both the course as well as the intense planning year that is ahead for us as the ABSN curriculum transforms to the new AACN Essentials. She made a couple of concerning comments:\n1. What do you do with that many students in a lecture room?\n2. Do you have graduate students to \"help out?\" (* It was explained to her that she would be part of the \"help\" and that we believe our students pay for and deserve not graduate students but full faculty). \n3. I would not have to take them into the clinical setting, would I? ***This was the most concerning. I do not believe she has the skills to evaluate the learning needs of pre-liscensure students. \nIf her presentation at noon was any indication of her possible style in the classroom with students, then she would have considerable work to master to be able to engage our highly challenging students in the classroom. Her presentation was flat, cold, it lacked any \"spark\" about her topic…and she demonstrated no enthusiasm for her own work. Now one might argue that she was nervous and certainly in the company of DHD she probably was more nervous….but she just never \"warmed up\" or demonstrated much excitement all day. I really do think by the end of the day, she was more enthusiastic about DUSON, though she shared in the morning that \"Duke was not on her radar, as she has focused her efforts on the top 5 ranked schools.\" It was through her research (post-doc) mentor at Illinois and the relationship with DHD that she considered Duke. That after getting here, she was very surprised by the \"internal support for research and all that is here, including the incredible opportunity to collaborat with DHD.\" Building on that, there were many questions about what her teaching load might look like and \"how she could buy her time out of teaching with grant funding.\" That said combined with her self-admitted deficits of even basic teaching principals and skills, I cannot support her hire for the ABSN position"},{"evalNum":"267","CandID":"201","DateOfVisit":"2010-05-04T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"DUSON Faculty","qualitative":"I did not have the opportunity to meet with her prior to her presentation so I am not sure if she was slightly nervous and was not able to articulate her research as well.

I discussed with her the challenges of teaching ABSN students and she seemed not to get why a straight powerpoint might not be an effective teaching method..  She only wants tenure track; didn’t even consider Duke because it was not one of the top 4-5 schools but when UIC decreased their contributions to the retirement plans her mentor said to also look elsewhere so she came down some notches to look at Duke (well wasn't that a slap in the face to us!); very concerned about our retirement plans and whether they were solid.  Her husband is a professor in Chicago and cannot retire for 4 years so she wants to be in Chicago Friday through Sunday fly here on Monday and stay until Thurs eve.

She has received R-level funding from a variety of institutes within the NIH, including the Fogarty Center, the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute for Dental and Cranio-facial disorders, and has a number of proposals under review.  The focus of her research is on the effects of cognitive impairment and oral health.  In this work, she has partnered with other, well-recognized investigators at Duke, and has successfully obtained funding for and executed international studies in this area.  She is poised to become one of the leading scientists in global health and aging.  Importantly, her work has direct implications for nursing practice, emphasizing, as it does, the impact of cognitive impairment on oral health, which, in turn, has been linked with a variety of important health outcomes.

She has good connections with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and is doing considerable work in the largely unexplored area of dental health in the elderly. She is opening up this field, in addition to her concern with health care provision to the elderly. She has a substantial publication record, has collaborated with others, and clearly more than pulls her own weight.  Her interests align well with OGACHI, she would be an outstanding addition.

Importantly, Dr. Wu has an NIH-funded program of intervention-focused research in oral healthcare and oral healthcare disparities, which would address a research and teaching gap that currently exists in DUSON.

He has taught before, clearly is comfortable in both large and small group settings and I think of the three candidates can make the best contribution to the ABSN program. He is strong, solid and will not be swept away by the personalities and agendas in the ABSN program. I see him coming in and making a contribution in a course that has never been right and is still plagued with issues. Perhaps the addition of another point of view….one that is grounded in contemporary clinical practice and new teaching ideas will bring the enthusiasm for mental health nursing that ABSN students need to see. They come to this program interested in the topic and because of  their weak clinical and classroom experience they exit not wanting to go anywhere near the clinical area. Mark's enthusiasm and positive role modeling will do much to bolster this course and establish a strong footing within the ABSN curriculum. I stronly support his appointment and feel of the three candidates that he is unquestionably the best one for the job. As an aside, it will be a positive statement that \"one of our own\" doctoral candidates is on faculty here. This will be a very positive factor for those ABSN students who are examining the possiblity of doctoral work for their own careers. On another note, I suspect that that he will meet with resistance among some of the ABSN faculty…which is unfortunate, but true. I hope the search committee can look beyond the \"agendas\" of some of the faculty and choose the candidate that can provide us the best foundation for the students and the program. I believe that person to be Mark Toles."},{"evalNum":"324","CandID":"250","DateOfVisit":"2010-11-09T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Academic/Admin Team","qualitative":"I think that Mark could effectively do the position.

I was quite concerned when I mentioned that I know her Dean at UNC-Charlotte, and after three tries she could not state the correct name for the Dean.

We need a FNP who has mastery of his or her primary care practice and who can hit the ground in full gear and comfort, has past teaching experience as member of a faculty, has mastered advising, and mentoring students, and role modeling in practice. She is not a member of any NP professional organizations which was surprising since she listed that she had received the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners State Award for Excellence, she did not list it by the proper title, but I think this is what she meant. Her CV also contains several misspellings and editing errors, including 'appealant' (correct spelling should be appellant); surprising since she presented that much of her work deals with evidence in the court system. She has never had membership in any nursing or advance practice nursing organization at the local, state, or national level.

He has been the only candidate for the FNP positions to meet all of the criteria. Per the  position announcement:  A.  The well qualified candidate will be certified as a family nurse practitioner and eligible for licensure as an advanced practice nurse in North Carolina.  B.  Two to three years experience teaching at the graduate level and  C.  Experiences teaching and caring for diverse populations is desirable.    \nMike is the only candidate who has interviewed to meet/master these expectations. Our FNP program has a history of attracting one of the largest student enrollments in the school for more than a decade. That trend is ever increasing. Our school needs faculty for these positions who are a good fit for DUSON who can readily fulfill faculy teaching, mentoring, and committee roles, plus when hired able to land on one's feet 'running and ready' as our FNP enrollment is burgeoning.  I met Mike in 2005 during the time he directed his large private practice in Clemson where he was responsible for the staffing, finances, and full management of a private model outpatient primary care facility. He has years of national FNP certification and board of nursing approval/licensure to practice. He brings a level of clinical practice and practice management experience in the private sector that we do not have among FNPs in North Carolina. He will be an excellent resource for our FNP students who seek to operate a primary care practice in the future that has a viable finance model and collaboratively (among with other community practice owners) that can address primary health issues for a large and diverse population.   Mike is a master clinician and he has a  record of clinical practice leadership and excellence as evidenced by awards in this area: American Academy of Nurse Practitioners State Award for Excellence - only one or two NPs receive this award in N.C. each year. Mike was one of two honored from N.C. in 2010, and only the second DUSON faculty to ever receive this national award while at Duke. Mike has preceptoring/mentoring experience in three university FNP settings: Emory, Clemson, and Duke.  He can motivate students as I observed (in clinical site visits) with DUSON FNP students he preceptored. He took on difficulty students for us and brought their clinical skills to and in some instances above minimum expectations.  Michael is the only candidate among those presented to faculty thus far for interview who has had full faculty  experience. He taught NP courses across the primary care clinical spectrum at Emory, and delivered invited NP clinical lectures at Clemson and Duke. While his interview presentation was an example of the scholarship he could provide to students in our DNP program, Mike also has knowledgeable and engaging delivery for advance practice clinical lectures as evidenced during his faculty presentationduring his 2005 DUSON interview, and more recently as guest faculty for DUSON clinical lectures.  Mike's national and state contributions would provide additional leadership presence in the academy among our faculty.  He has a history of contributions to clinical nursing societies (i.e. American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, Georgia NP Council, and the Georgia Nurses Association). His knowledge of these organizations  will be a plus in mentoring our FNP students for more organizational membership and leadership. Lastly, Mike's has and continues to hold prominent roles on the national CCNE Executive Board. None of our DUSON faculty has held this leadership honor. He knows FNP program standards for excellence.This could bring standards up front and center to us from a faculty peer.

Additionally she is currently President of her STT chapter which would also be valuable to us at DUSON in trying to create a more active, vibrant STT chapter here.

At times she tended to talk to much, and would wander off topic.  She strikes me as hard working and caring.  Her presentation was incredibly disappointing.  Even though she had recently completed her dissertation research (and it appears such is going to be published in a good journal) she selected to present on how she would teach ACNP students to calculate TNP mixture and dose.  This was a how to lecture.  It did not even include critical decision making -- such as the risks and benefits of TPN -- how to make the decision of beginning TPN, how to decide to end TPN, how to prepare patients and families etc.  There was no hint of using an evidence base in decision making -- it wasn't even mentioned. Variation in practice was brushed off as this is how it is -- so you need to learn the formula for different hospitals (true but not inspiring).   It was straight formulaic.  And as such it was pretty good --at the end one knew the components of TPN, how to calculate calories from each, and set the delivery rate. But to be honest -- I could give that lecture -- and I am not an ACNP -- and haven't practiced clinically in a long time.   To her credit -- she did her homework for this presentation -- she contacted the doctor at Duke who oversees TPN and throughout her talk referenced what we do at Duke.  She is clearly interested in Duke.  But I am left wondering if she is simply a concrete thinker -- coming to a school that values conceptual thinking, leadership and evidence based practice?  Can she build our program?  Will she be able to maintain the clinical sites we have and develop others?  I would need additional data before considering her for a faculty position.

One thing that was disturbing to me was that his cv did not reflect many contributions that I know he has made to the SON and to the profession.  For example, for years he has been the contract faculty member teaching the three acute care NP courses.  Uusally his name was not listed as the faculty member (a regular rank faculty member was listed) but he in fact taught the courses.  I also know that he has developed many of our clinical sites for the ACNP program, many of these sites are staffed (the preceptors) by our own graduates who have strong professional ties to Dr. Blessing.  Finally, I know that he consults with major tertiary hospitals across the country (I believe he is off to Hopkins this week) related to practice models for ACNPs.  The reason why these accomplishments aren't evident in his cv, is related to the one key area where he will need help.  Dr. Blessing needs to be mentored in learning the faculty role (and in regard to his cv -- what faculty document).  He has taught as a contract faculty member for years, but he has never been mentored or held a regular rank faculty position.  He has many strengths.  He is recognized as an outstanding acute care NP, and a leader.  He has expertise in models of care.  He has excellent ideas regarding how to build the ACNP program, and sufficient professional contacts to develop and add the needed clinical sites.  He is a good teacher.   He is well respected in our health system.  He has an opportunity to do international work in Germany -- and has made progress in moving this forward.  He has consistently advanced his education, and is committed to learning.  Some may weigh in negatively about his lack of \"faculty role\" understanding since he has taught for us.  I would simply say -- his only role was as a contract faculty member to teach courses -- and he did that well.  He does need to learn the faculty role.

Although the candidate's doctoral research is very interesting and cutting edge, it is unclear to me how these findings will lead to an intervention study, so I am concered about her ability to obtain funding for this program of research as she moves forward.  It is unclear how easy/difficult it will be for her to obtain her next round of funding based on the findings she presented from her dissertation.  It will be very challenging for this candidate to juggle teaching new courses full time at DUSON, generating multiple publications from her dissertation work, and writing for grants.

During her interview at Duke she expressed an interest in becoming an excellent researcher and has pursued her PhD as a step in achieving this goal.  Her presentation was reasonable and she ably discussed her doctoral work. However, given her topic and qualitative methodology, future funding may be an issue. ORA would need to work with her in structuring future research so that she might obtain funding that will help her further research in her area of interest.  Like many doctoral students she is tied to the work of her advisor, which may not be the most fertile path for her to follow in her future work.  \nDuring her interviews with the APT Committee she was overly talkative -- and at times talked for long periods without directly answering questions. This was distracting, and may be related to the nervousness of interviewing. I think she possesses qualities we are seeking in a faculty member.  Her role in the ABSN program needs to be clarified -- I believe she could bring expertise to the ABSN program both in adult health and in basic courses such as pharmacology.  She also could teach in NP majors in the MSN program, and over time could teach in the graduate program.

I know there will be many (esp. those that know her from another time in her career) that will not see or will over look the behaviors she demonstrated during her interview time here. However, I have no history with this candidate. I found her behavior to be both bizarre and rude. She never and I do mean NEVER stopped talking about herself in the interview. Were she a patient in my clinic, I would have recorded \"manic episode\" to characterize her behavior in this interview. At first I thought it was nerves. Upon further reflection, I do not think it was nerves. I believe it to be representative of her  personality combined with unsophistication. To say flat out in an interview when ask, \"Why Duke?\" She stated, \"The money, it is a position, I would not have to leave the Triange (and oh, how many times she stated she did not want to leave the Triangle) and with the cuts happening at UNC I could get a better job here…and why, I had no idea what you all were doing over here till I got the packet…and with your pretty new building, and the people I know and that woman who helps you with your teaching, I could now consider it.\"  I timed her, it took 18 minutes with hardly a breath to say this, and much more! This kind of behavior cannot be overlooked…it is a \"sign\" of something else. That she is so unsophisticated to have said this….but more importantly that she never inquired about our students, what it like to be a faculty member here, etc. says more of her motivations.  But the worst of it, was when one of the faculy members attempted to ask her question, she put her hand up to silence our collegue so that she could pick up on one of her flight of ideas from a previous answer.

In a 22 page CV there are less than a dozen references to research productivity related to her doctoral work and program. (Yes she has managed over 30 clinical trials but this is not her work.) In the last year she has secured a T32 spot (unclear why only in her last year of the program) and had recognition for her doctoral research from AANP and Sigma Theta Tau. She referenced a Jane Smith scholarship in awards but not under grants or research (not clear that exactly that was for). In fact, only Sigma Theta Tau was listed in grants which led me to believe this might have been the only one she competed for. Unlike most soon to be PhD graduates, she does not have any grant applications currently in development or under review, any dissertation or doctoral program publications under review, in press or published or any abstracts or refereed presentations submitted or completed. None in 4 years. As an almost new PhD graduate, she is not yet prepared for a tenure track position and at this point wouldn't even be competitive for a K award given her lack of productivity. It would be my recommendation that she seek out a postdoctoral position to have time to publish and secure external funding without the distraction of teaching and mentorship of ABSN students.

He was not very forthcoming while in my office in answering my own questions about his talk. Of course, during the talk he did answer questions. My gut feeling is that he would be a great resource technically - I have no good read about what he would be like to work with. I wish it was more positive.I did have a few more thoughts on the candidate yesterday.  Certainly he has wonderful technical skills. Frankly far beyond mine! In this sense it would be great to have him here. On the other hand, I was thinking about that presentation.  He should have known that the audience would not be mathematical statisticians. As such, he should have been much more explanatory.  Much of the technical details should have been omitted or if included just explained if possible. To make faculty sit through something like that is slightly disrespectful of their time. I only had about 15 minutes with him and he did not strike me as particularly eager to discuss his work with me on a one to one basis. I was sort of surprised at this.

I did not get a feel that he understood that a certain portion of his time would be devoted to statistical service work for primarily small sample size projects (studies with less than 200 individuals enrolled)..

I found myself wondering why this candidate is applying for a position within a nursing school- as his language, work, and presentation style is more geared towards biostatistics or epidemiology.

He was approachable, interpersonally warm, listened carefully and is I think a thoughtful scholar.  I also think he would bring excellent analytical skills to faculty on grants. My only concern is whether or not he would be better suited in an environment where more faculty are doing statistical research.  Perhaps he could find such on the Duke campus.

She shared that she has never taught groups as \"large as Duke's ABSN cohorts\" and has \"never taught maternity nursing.\" That in order to teach maternity content she will have to \"quickly take  CEU courses to get herself up to speed on maternity clinical issues.\" Most concerning was her description of herself during the group interview as \"having self-esteem issues that have followed her all her life.\" Her presentation style at the 1pm meeting was weak; she read slides from the monitor, never left the podium and at times could not be seen.  She is a sweet, dear and very likeable woman. Her protrayal of herself and the focus of her career would indicate that she is not at this time prepared for the challenges and rigor that would be required of her at Duke.

It became even more clear to me that she has not yet thought through what it is she wants to do after completing her PhD. When offered opportunities to teach in areas other than the one she applied for she responded, \"I will do anything I am asked to do and do it well but I may not be excited about it.\" So while she probably would be a good lead faculty mentor in a clinical research management track, she had little interest and mentioned wanting to get away from those experiences in her past. When asked about the direction of her research she at one time suggested she would pursue clinical research first to test her ideas; in another breath she was going to apply for implementation research awards and ten minutes later said she would be ready in one year to submit a models of care delivery grant. I do not feel she is a strong candidate at this time for a tenure track position. However, I do support her candidacy for the ABSN program on the clinical track. They would benefit from having a strong cardiovascular clinician with research expertise and training. She would bring a nice blend of research, practice and project management to the class which is a good model for new nurses. If Ms. Davis is serious about the research career she has ahead she may want to consider a postdoc where her time would be protected and she could write and apply for external funding (because both publications in her area of research and applications for external funds are lacking). Alternatively, she could request to protect one semester in her first year at Duke as a clinical faculty member and she could solidify her ideas and submit for a K99/R00 to protect her time in years to come.

It is unclear how well he could translate his statistical knowledge into what is needed in the school's PhD, DNP and master's level programs; which are all very applied courses. It is also unclear how well he could work with faculty to collaborate to write grants, although my sense is that he would learn to do this in a shorter time period than teaching.  I am a little confused now about his degree: is it in epidemiology or is it in biostatistics? It is not a PhD so my guess is that it is in epidemiology, but his CV syas biostatistics. The degree requirements for a DPH are not the same as those for a PhD.  Additional comments:  \n-Other faculty may  thought Dr. Wang’s presentation to be overly technical and mathematical.

She has been an active member of her professional organization (AANA)regionally and nationally.

She has a significant record of funding – but it is primarily in funding from HRSA – and not research focused.  On the other hand, if she is appointed in the Practice track – this will be a strength.  Her talk was somewhat disappointing.  It was primarily a “basic education” on what public health nursing is, and what care management is.  She did list her grants – and when asked to discuss two of them – had very basic slides on one of the projects.  But there was nothing scholarly in these slides.  One had no idea of the N, the design, the analysis plan or the data supported outcomes.   I think she does have a very significant knowledge related to public health, particularly in regard to maternal health and the health of young children.

I thought her presentation was not effective- an overview of public health nursing then a list of her projects. She then asked the audience which one(s) she should talk about and when marva selected one she said she did not have the slides for that project.

During her interview, she demonstrated significant strengths in being able to reframe individual faculty perspectives on public health and community health nursing education and practice, which relates to her ability to grow school-level progress in these areas, rather than be limited to the ability to implement a single course in a single program.

While I applaud his desire to keep up his clinical practice, I wonder to what extent it will impact his role as an educator.  It is clear he is a solid researcher, but in this new role, he will have to take on a new responsibility of teaching, which he currently is not doing.  One other concern is his very causual approach to the interview.  While I found it quite refreshing that he was so comfortable speaking with various groups of other professionals and this allowed him to impart his passion for his clinical area, he was almost 'too casual' for an interview setting (i.e. slang and mild expletives) which makes me wonder how he will be presented to and received by our students.

While she seems okay, I found her to be \"so-so.\" What is more important is that she has been inappropriate in her current role in the program committee meetings. She offers opinions about things that she does not yet understand the background on issues. I think this is a RED FLAG. Shows her lack of understanding about determining the culture and getting to know what is going on, before she offers opinions. I know that one member of the ABSN team is really pushing for her hire.

I feel like she would be a very good team player and contributor to the ABSN faculty.  It was clear during her interview that she sees teaching as something she is truly drawn to, not something that she just has to do to ensure her professional livlihood.  Her clincal knowledge is both extensive and current, and she also maintains her advanced practice skills; this will make her relevent in the master's program as well as the ABSN program.

On one hand -- I found the candidate engaging, his publication record is remarkable for a nurse clinican, and he has some consistant research dollars and a passion for research.  He is grounded in clincial problems and research to solve such problems.  Yet at the end of the day given his presentation-- one questions what he has discovered. He claims the \"context of care\" -- which seemed to clearly engage our clinical faculty -- and yet I was left wondering is this really feasible and does his research really support such.  My hope is that our Associate Dean for Research will weigh in on Dr. Olson's research trajectory and possibilities.  She has worked with him on an RO1, and will have far greater knowledge of his research promise.  I also attended his presentataion.  It was a world tour of all of his work -- so one could not really evaluate methodologies and interpretation of findings,  Yet he was incredibly engaging -- a powerful presenter -- I felt as if I were in the presence of someone with a fantastic stage performance.  And as a nurse clinican he has done done remarkable things. Yet in his presentation \"performance\" -- I think he made some of our colleagues uncomfortable (including me).  And although I think it was not intended -- his presentation included dramatic renditions of  - for example - the southern dialetic in a vinette of \"he's dead\"   -- the focus on the southern accent of a seemingly uneducated or at least not well educated nurse could offend members of our community.  I am quite sure he did not intend such -- but his presentation  was on stage dramatic -- not scholarly.  He was powerful -- but I could not shake the feeling that \"something was not quite right.\"  He could be a powerful teacher in the ABSN progrm -- but I am ambivalent about this candidate.  If I had to tip the balance in a decisionn --  I would be wary in offering him a position. But I would defer to ABN colleagues.

First and foremost - Dr. Holland originally applied for the junior researcher position at DUSON and expressed her surpirse in being interviewed for the \"health policy\" position.  She expressed concern that she does not see herself as a fit for the policy position and fears that the lack of fit will reduce her changes of being offered the job.  Her best fit, she feels, is in the junrio researcher position.  Dr. Holland's immediate plans are to apply for a K award from NINR.  Since the health policy position was created in direct response to a documented need for teaching faculty in the DNP program, winning a K award would remove Dr. Holland from fulfilling the primary purpose the position was created to solve.  Dr. Holland is NOT (I can not say this strongly enough) educated nor experientially qualified to teach N655 Health Systems Transformations.   With strong mentoring and a lot of my time, Dr. Holland could teach probably N652 Transforming the Nation's Health (the policy course).  Her Phd program was indeed titled \"Health Policy and Administration\" as was my DrPH program.  In the Senate I learned quickly having 2 courses in health policy from faculty with no political or policy experience did NOT provide a substantive background in health policy.  Dr. Holland has had one course in policy analysis.  She has conducted zero advocacy.  She does not follow health policy except as it applies to her area of research.  She does not know policy priorities and issues facing nurses nor does she know the nuances related to policy and nursing....recent pressures to change such as LACE, FON report, RAND report, Carnegie report.  Neither of the two courses the in which the DNP program needs faculty are good fits for Dr. Holland.   Dr. Holland has never taken an online course nor taught online.  She mentioned having \"some online content\" available to students in the courses in which she gave guest lectures but she was unclear beyond that statement.  She has never managed a full semester course.  She states that she is \"good at explaining complex subjects in simple way\" but when asked if she could translate that skill from a face to face setting to an online setting she is visible jarreed and admits that she has no idea how to do that.  Dr. Holland is highly qualified to teach N404 Health Economics (which could use a second section) but N404 has not been identified as a priority for resourcing.  She seemed happy at the suggestion of teaching economics and shared some of the health econ books she likes.  With her MPH and population based research, Dr. Holland is highly qualified to teach N301 Population Based Approaches to Health and exhibited some excitement about the prospect.   \nIn summary:  I do not recommend Dr. Holland for the position of health policy faculty."},{"evalNum":"580","CandID":"350","DateOfVisit":"2012-02-02T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"Dr. Holland does not have any clinical experience per her CV, but she is not an RN.

I think our description of what he would need to do to establish a program of research was sobering for him. It seemed to really take the wind out of his sails, which is troubling; I would’ve preferred a response more along the lines of “Wow! Great!

When I met with Dr. Olson at this second visit, I started the conversation making certain that he had an opportunity to get his questions answered.  His response was, “I do not have any questions.  I really don’t know why I am here today”.  I shared with him that this was an opportunity to have a follow-up conversation about faculty roles/responsibilities in the ABSN program and DUSON overall.  As such, I talked about his involvement in advising, committee work, teaching and continuing his scholarship.  During Dr. Olson’s first visit, we discussed this adult health position as part of a continuum of courses – fundamentals, pharm, patho, adult health, geriatrics.  During the first visit, I shared with him that an area of critical need is pharmacology.  During this second visit, Dr. Olson stated that he only understood this position to be “to teach in the adult health course”.  I again clarified with him the continuum of courses, the annual faculty bidding process used to cover this continuum of courses, and the desire/process for having a clearly articulated teaching load as part of the hiring process.  During this conversation, he repeatedly stated that he was interested in teaching in the adult health course.  Through this conversation, I sensed rigidity and inflexibility as part of a team to cover the courses of the program.  Throughout the conversation, Dr. Olson did not seem genuinely interested in the position.  When the conversation ended, I did not sense that Dr. Olson would be a flexible team player.  Although an inexperienced educator, he did not identify any areas where he would need guidance as an educator.  Further, I also sensed that he might be very difficult to coach/mentor as a junior faculty member.   This is alarming since, whether new or experienced, all of us have areas for improvement as educators, scientists, colleagues, etc.  Overall, I do not believe Dr. Olson is a “good fit” for the position."},{"evalNum":"598","CandID":"310","DateOfVisit":"2012-03-12T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"I met with the candidate in a small group, attended her research presentation and joined her for dinner.

Her research work is with Chinese Americans in China Town in SF.  I don't think there is a comparable population here.  She may be able to transition to different cultural groups here -- but if one considers the Asian population in the Triangle (and the numbers are considerable in Wake County) - I don't think the majority are Chinese.

(He says FT faculty but also had clinical and other positions overlapping in this time period.)   I was dissappointed by his presentation. While Dr. Moussa was energitic and passionate, I thought he actaully had very little to say in his presentaiton. To me, the presention demonstrated 2 things: 1.) a lack of fundamental research training (no validated instrument, poor description of intervention and only rudimentary statistical analysis that was clearly done by someone else), and 2.) His poor teaching style (the ppt slides were endless, the data were presented quite poorly), it lacked innovation in the presentation.  While I understand that the research expertise is not a job requirement, I think the ability to present work and data clearly is a critical and mimumal requirement for any faculty position at Duke.  Dr. Moussa could have given a much better description of the e-learning tool - including visualizations to engage the audience and illustrate the difference between the e-learning and the paper version. And while the pre-post comparison statistics were appropriate and well done, a set of descriptive statistics, neatly presented and discussed, would have been more than adequate.

Admitted that he spent his time preparing by reviewing faculty bios and trying to figure out who might mentor him in his research…perhaps he did not read the job description? Was a little taken back by the fact that he would be advisinig students, serving on committees and being part of activities in the program, like curriculum redesign.  He has no acute care experience and has incredibly unrealistic expectations for his trajectory at DUSON as evidenced by his goal statement at the end of his formal presentation. He expressed concern at how\" these other activities\" (like teaching and an advising load) would impact his \"tenure clock?\"The only place I could even remotely see him is in gero and it looks like we have that filled?  Bottom line: No match exists between his skills and abilities and our needs (job was for an adult position in the ABSN program). Granted he has been mentored by our soon to be vice dean and he is diverse. He gave the clear impression he would \"do whatever Duke wants me to do\" to obtain a position here. That said,  he is not a fit….would not be a match for our ABSN students and the equivelent experience that our faculty have in teaching and clinical practice. Perhaps he would be a good post-doc? But not a faculty position. His skills and experience are one dimensional and do not meet the criteria for this position….mainly because he has no interest in teaching and cannot provide any flexibility in skills to the ABSN Program. A very nice man, with a nice personality."},{"evalNum":"650","CandID":"389","DateOfVisit":"2012-05-23T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"It is unfortunate that this candidate was brought here to interview for a position that clearly requires teaching.  According to the job listing: \"Possible teaching acticvities of this position could include fundamentals/ health assessment, pathophysiology, pharmacology and or adult health (med surg nursing).\" Does the word possible mean that he really doesn't have to teach??   Not only has this candidate never worked in an acute care setting, but he worked in LTC over 4 years ago and did mostly administration and sparse patient care.  On top of that, his \"teaching experience\" is as a TA, in which he graded papers and \"did a few guest lectures\".  Does that count as teaching experience?  It doesn't according to the NC Board of Nursing or our APT committee.  He couldn't remember exactly what or how many lectures he did though as they were so long ago.  Beyond what the faculty needs are for competent teachers, do our students not deserve someone who at least has taught, or taken students to clinical, or maybe even precepted students at least once or twice?  If his program of research is so crucial to bring him here, please add him to our Gero faculty and Not Adult Health.   On top of that, he did absolutely no prep for knowing about DUSON.  He never heard about OGACHI or MADIN, and knew very little to nothing about the ABSN Program.  When told about advising and committee work, he asked if he would still have to take a full assignment if his research was in full swing.  He hadn't really put much thought into what the teaching repsonsibilities would be because his focus is research.

His focus in the presentation seemed to be about the desire to develop his program of research, which is a great match for our faculty that are working in Gero/Adult health, etc but I’m not sure it fits our need for an additional classroom teacher.  He would be terrific teaming with our community of researchers and with mentoring would be a great addition to our program, if he is wanting to develop his classroom/teaching approach AS WELL as his research.  He appears comfortable presenting and sharing his knowledge but has not acute care adult health experiences a bedside nurse, making it difficult to translate the experience to students.  I would want to ask more about his willingness to teach foundational nursing content, actively work with the current Adult-health faculty, etc.  He may have addressed this in the other sessions I was unable to attend.

It was my impression he was being recruited to fill the role of an adult health expert, but in discussions with this candidate, he has limited experience at the bedside having only worked in LTC; no acute care experience.  While this would allow him to teach certain clinical classes such as Foundations and Gero, he is not suited to teach Adult Health, which is significant need.  Additionally, he lacks significant teaching experience, and did not really express much interest in developing this skill set- he seems very focused on his research program.  While this is a very important component, especially since he is pursuing a tenure track position, we all have obligations to not only teach within our respective programs, but also do so in an effective and innovative way.  Like I have said, he did not seem to offer much interest in this particular area.

There are a lot of people at Duke for him to collaborate with and senior mentorship will be key to his success. His reason for not getting a post-doc when there are so many in his area of research was practical (needs financial stability for his family) but weak from a career trajectory perspective (my opinion). I suppose not everyone needs post-doc training to be successful but he did change research interests three times over his doctoral training and he doesn't seem very focused. Again, senior mentorship (he has chosen Dr. Anderson) will be important particularly as he seeks K-level/Hartford/RWJ career development awards.   ***I feel that the needs of the ABSN program are somewhat unique and there is a risk of recruiting entry-level tenure-track candidates who are aiming for career development awards that may conflict with the teaching needs of an intense teaching program.

We were under the impression when we invited her to come to interview that she had a traditional post-doc experience with Dr. David Lobach under the AHRQ contract.  However, she functioned as a team member under this contract and was mainly conducting the literature review. She did not write any grants during this post-doc experience.  Although she presented this work to us as her own, Dr. David Lobach was the PI on this contract.  It probably would have been better if she had presented her dissertation work. It was clear that she wasn't fully informed on all of the work because she couldn't adequately address several of the questions posed to her.  I was particularly concerned that she couldn't address questions I posed to her on the heterogeneity results of the meta-analysis.  Furthermore, she did not have any grant writing experiences during her doctoral program and mentioned that she just worked on faculty funded grants.  When we asked her about her program of research, she said that she would like to work in the hospital part-time to get some ideas about the informatics problems. Basically, she doesn't have any ideas about the focus of her future research.   With regard to teaching, she mentioned that she could teach classes on decision-support and usability engineering, yet she did not know about the basics of building decision-support systems such as rule based systems, bayesian belief networks, influence diagrams, etc… Furthermore, she has very little experience and training in usability engineering.Usability engineering is significantly more than heuristic evaluation.   My biggest concern with this candidate is her ability to build a program of research, learn to teach and advise students, and be involved in service work at the same time.  If she at least had an idea about a program of research or was continuing to build on her dissertation research, this would be very workable.  However, we need a full-time faculty member devoted to our program, not a half-time faculty member who works part-time in the hospital and part-time in the program. I have serious concerns about her being able to do the work required of a full-time faculty member at the onset of her start.

This candidate fulfills our interest in hiring diverse faculty members, but I am not convinced she has a strong research platform or the abiltiy to secure external research funding.  She does demonstrate ability to work in large interdisciplinary team. Dr. Bright is not a nurse so she will not be able to teach ABSN and will be limited to master's / informatics track - although this is probably ok as per position description, may be worth noting."},{"evalNum":"671","CandID":"396","DateOfVisit":"2012-08-29T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"I enjoyed meeting and speaking with Tiffani. She is bright, very articulate, hardworking and highly motivated. However, upon speaking with her on 3 different meetings during her visit, it is clear to me that she is very inexperienced in teaching and research and informatics, and not clear on the nature of a faculty position.  While DUSON could certainly provide her mentoring for both teaching and research, I worry that she does not have enough experience (within university setting) to make a truly informed decision about whether this is a match for her. Her resume does indicate her experience as a Teaching Assistant, but it seems it was more of an administrative role and Tiffani was not engaged in the course content in any way. Also, she was not exposed to grant writing in her doctoral program on any level - either as a course, through observation, or in writing a research proposal of any kind herself.\n\nWhat concerns me the most is that I do not think Tiffani has a solid focus or research interest area within informatics. Her disseration and post-doc were on two completely different topics, so she does not have any depth of experience or coursework in any one area.  I had hoped that her affiliation with Dr. Suzanne Bakken (doctoral advisor) and a school of nursing would give her perspective and understanding of nursing or clinical care that she could give to our students with nursing backgrounds, but, it does not appear that there was a strong relationshio or affiliation there (my personal guess). I believe that Tiffani's dissertation   topic was given to her by a faculty member and not reflective of her interests or quest.  The work that she presented in her talk was certainly very well done, but I think she was a team member of a literature review and meta-analysis project that was defined, designed, and analyzed and interpretted entirely by others.  I was concerned that she did not demonstrate a clear understanding of some of the concepts she presented (e.g,. Publication bias) as well as basic research methodology. While it was overall a nice report she described - and truly excellent presentation on her part - it is clear that she does not have any depth or breadth of undrestanding in Clinical Decision Supoprt to effectly teach a course by that name in the informatics program. \n\nBecause she lacks applied experience in any healthcare discipline, or with applied informatics, it will be a tremdendous challenge for her to develop learning exercies and meaningful examples to engage students. (I know because I am non-clinical background and it is a struggle for me but I have a bit more experiences to draw from.)   She clearly is yearning for some experience with information systems, and expressed interest on a 50% hospital position and 50% DUSON.  While that would give her great insight, connections, experience, and gernerate research ideas, I fear that will leave her less engaged in teaching and advising students. I resepect and admire this request, because informatics problems are applied problems, and it would be terrific to have these connectsions. Overall, I worry that Tiffani does not yet have concrete ideas for research projects and grant proposals, and that will take some time to even be ready to start the grant writing.  \n\nTiffani is undoubtedly smart and has great communications skils and great potential to be an educator, if she wants to, but at this time, I believe she does not have enough knoweldge of any one area of informatics to teach most of the classes we offer in the informatics program (nor she did not express any confidence in that to me.)  She does have great communication and social skills, and I could see her successfully working well with others and engaging in projects across the Duke Medical Center and campus.  I worry that she will be overwhelmed in this position as she needs support to increase her informatics knowledge, practical skills and knowledge in informatics, research concepts, grant writing, and teaching, as well as advising and overseeing applied informatics practica. I think it will take her some time to gain the needed experience and skills, and ultimately might not be successful. I am also not sure if she is truly interested in a faculty position or a research career. I see from her webpage that she has interests in consulting and applied informatics work in hospitals. With all that said, she is bright and motivated and has great potential for successes in informatics, just not sure that she is a match for our needs at this time."},{"evalNum":"672","CandID":"396","DateOfVisit":"2012-08-29T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"I only attended her presentation.

His research presentation was quite engaging and he was a good speaker explaining quite a complex topic in an understandable manner. This clearly showed evidence of his teaching ability.  I was quite concerned about his misunderstanding about the profession of nursing where he had no idea that nurses obtained doctoral degrees, particularly PhDs and did not understand that nurses even conduct research. He didn't have any interest in collaborating with SON faculty, but his main interest was only collaboration with those in computer science. He was also only interested in hearing about the development of the Health Informatics PhD program which is currently in the discussion phase within the Duke Center for Health Informatics.  In general, he just didn't seem that interested in the School of Nursing. I have no doubt that he would be successful in teaching our technical courses but he didn't seem to have any indepth knowledge of the healthcare system which I fear would limit his ability to teach other informatics courses.  He also only had interest in potential PhD students and was quite surprised that he would have to mentor Master's and Certificate students. He was also very surprised that he would have to be involved in service work at the school. The final issue that arose was workload and he seemed concerned that he would potentially have to work on weekends.  In the end, I am not clear that he would be good fit at the SON."},{"evalNum":"697","CandID":"399","DateOfVisit":"2012-10-30T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Academic/Admin Team","qualitative":"Delightful young man; i think he would fit well with us. he asked questions that indicated a keen interest in the job and a grasp of what we are about."},{"evalNum":"698","CandID":"399","DateOfVisit":"2012-10-30T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"Nice person but no expertise in teaching"},{"evalNum":"699","CandID":"399","DateOfVisit":"2012-10-30T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Others","qualitative":"Dr. Liu has expertise in natural language processing and connections both within academia and industry.

I was not able to attend her presentation, so cannot speak to that aspect of her interview. She did say that she had chosen Track II because her \"PhD was always about teaching\". She didn't have a clear plan for developing her area of scholarship around teaching, but that is likely to come with the support of senior faculty mentoring her into her first academic position."},{"evalNum":"705","CandID":"425","DateOfVisit":"2012-12-18T00:00:00","evalCompleter":"Faculty","qualitative":"I enjoyed talking with Dr. Ashton,  She is very articulate and engaging.
