    <h2>Why are you being asked to complete this form?</h2>

    <p>Because we do business with the government, we must reach out to, hire, and provide equal opportunity to
        qualified people with disabilities.i To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if
        you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you
        will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not
        be used against you in any way.

    <p>If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become
        disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years.
        You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you
        did not identify as having a disability earlier.</p>

    <h2>How do I know if I have a disability?</h2>

    <p>You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that
        substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical
        condition.</p>

    <p>Disabilities include, but are not limited to:</p>
